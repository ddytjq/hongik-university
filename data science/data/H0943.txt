ABSTRACT:  The correlation between scalp EEG, intraoperative
electrocorticogram, neuroimaging and histopathology was examined in an
epileptic child with diffuse cortical dysplasia. The 6-year-old girl with
moderate mental retardation had suffered from intractable complex partial and
generalized epilepsies since the age of 2 years. MR images demonstrated
unilateral large macrogyria/polymicrogyria and schizencephaly in the right
occipital lobe. The epileptic focus was detected on the macrogyria by EEG and
single photon emission tomography. However, the intraoperative
electrocorticogram showed frequent spikes from the polymicrogyria and no
paroxysmal activity in the macrogyria. The polymicrogyria and the macrogyric
lesion were resected, using an image-guided system. The histological findings
revealed that the macrogyria was covered with and separated by glial bundles.
It has been reported that epileptogenicity is produced from abnormal neurons
and their arrangement in cortical dysplasia; in this case, however, the major
dysplastic lesion had no epileptogenicity; rather the focus might be in the
polymicrogyria around the lesion.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Schizencephaly is defined as a cerebral malformation of the CNS with
various clefts of the cerebral cortex. We report on two patients referred to
our department with neurological abnormalities. In both cases the cranial
sonography already provided for the clinical picture of schizencephaly. A
MR-scan confirmed the diagnosis. In addition one of the patients proved to have
a migrational disorder. The analysis of these cases and the relevant literature
point out how difficult the etiologic differentiation is and, on the other
hand, how various the manifestations of the malformation can be. The important
role of cranial sonography as a screening method is shown.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report the clinical and neuroimaging features of 4 cases with
schizencephaly. Case 1 had bilateral schizencephaly with open-lip on the right
and closed-lip on the left. Case 2 had unilateral schizencephaly with
closed-lip on the left and subcortical heterotopia on the right. Case 3 had
unilateral schizencephaly with closed-lip on the left. Case 4 had bilateral
closed-lip schizencephaly. Although all cases except for Case 3 had bilateral
lesions, neurodevelopmental outcome was generally good; Case 1 and 3 had mild
hemiparesis. All patient have epilepsy which are well-controlled with
antiepileptic drugs. Thus, the clinical presentation of schizencephaly, even if
bilateral lesions, are quite variable.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To report prospectively the prenatal diagnosis,
management and outcome of 14 cases of unilateral ventriculomegaly. METHODS:
Fourteen fetuses were diagnosed as having one ventricle of &gt; or = 10 mm, as
measured at the level of the atrium. RESULTS: In ten cases, the scan showed
mild unilateral ventriculomegaly with an atrium width between 11 and 13 mm and
this remained stable up to term. Eight of these fetuses had a magnetic
resonance imaging scan in utero between 32 and 34 weeks of gestation which
confirmed the diagnosis of mild ventriculomegaly without other brain
abnormalities and showed a normal cortical mantle. No obvious cause was found
and the outcome was normal in all cases. In four cases, the unilateral
ventriculomegaly evolved rapidly with an atrium width up to 20-25 mm. Causes
included atresia of the foramen of Monro, toxoplasmosis, brain atrophy and
Weaver syndrome. Three underwent termination of pregnancy and the postmortem
examination confirmed the diagnosis. The baby with brain atrophy and
schizencephaly had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed at 1 month of age and
has severe developmental delay at 9 months. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of
unilateral ventriculomegaly is uncertain. Examination of both ventricles during
the anomaly scan should be performed, as should ultrasound follow-up of these
cases up to the end of the third trimester. Fetuses with an isolated, mild,
stable unilateral ventriculomegaly seem to have a favourable neurological
outcome. However, fetuses with rapidly evolving unilateral ventriculomegaly or
cases associated with other brain abnormalities may have a poor neurological
outcome.<p>

ABSTRACT:  INTRODUCTION: Disturbances of neuroblast migration are prominent
among the numerous causes of symptomatic epilepsy and of abnormal neurological
development in children. DEVELOPMENT: Although their clinical manifestations
are generally nonspecific with considerable overlap of symptoms and signs
amongst the various disorders, the clinical picture of migratory disorders is
continuously being redefined with greater precision and, in some cases,
disorders of migration may be grouped into syndromes that are more easily
diagnosed during life, in large part because of major advances in recent years
in the technology of neuroimaging and in molecular genetics. It is therefore
possible to study these patients in greater detail and over longer periods when
detected early in life. CONCLUSIONS: I have reviewed the clinical
manifestations of some of the defined disorders of neuroblast migration:
lissencephaly-pachygyria types I and II, pachygyria, schizencephaly,
polymicrogyria, special location heterotopia, for example, periventricular
heterotopia and subcortical band heterotopia or 'double cortex' syndrome, the
latter closely related to isolated lissencephaly type I.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We analyzed interictal [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron
emission tomography (FGD-PET) and single photon emission computed tomography
with technetium-99m-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO-SPECT) in a
23-year-old female with schizencephaly. She had epilepsy and mild left
hemiparesis, but was otherwise developmentally normal. We found the glucose
metabolism and perfusion of the wall of the schizencephalic cleft to be
identical to those of normal cerebral cortex. The wall of the transcerebral
clefts, which were observed to be lined by abnormally organized gray matter as
a result of a migration disorder, demonstrated gray matter metabolic activity
and perfusion. FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT were thus found to be a useful
complement to magnetic resonance imaging for evaluating schizencephaly.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The pathogenesis of cleft formation in schizencephaly was analyzed
by examining the brain lesions produced by the infection of the Kilham strain
of mumps virus during the period of neuronal migration in hamsters. Mumps virus
antigen was detected in the neuroepithelial cells within the ventricular zone,
the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles, and vimentin-immunoreactive
radial glial fibers. The main pathological findings were cerebral hemorrhage,
neuronal necrosis, microsulci on the cerebral cortex and cleft formation
through the entire thickness of the cerebral mantle. The clefts seen in these
experiments were lined by embryonal elements such as neuroepithelial cells and
germinal cells. Based on these results and the original definition by Yakovlev
and Wadsworth, the following two conclusions were suggested. First, the mumps
virus localized to the neuroepithelial cells within the ventricular zone and
the radial glial fibers may induce a destructive process and subsequent
anomalous neuronal migration, resulting in cleft formation. Second, the
formation of the ventricular cleft extending to the pial surface, which should
be complete before the cortical infolding appears, is necessary in order to
produce the characteristic cleft in schizencephaly which is associated with the
pial-ependymal seam.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To determine the types, relative frequencies, clinical
features, and MRI characteristics of malformations of cortical development
(MCD) occurring in a cohort of children referred to a tertiary pediatric
center. METHODS: Original MR images were reviewed by two investigators, who
were blinded to clinical details, to determine the elemental imaging features
of each malformation and to label these malformations according to an existing
system of classification. Clinical information was collected by a review of
hospital records. RESULTS: A total of 109 children with MCD were identified.
There were 58 boys and 51 girls, age 8 days to 18 years at initial imaging
(mean age, 5 years). Seizures were present in 75%, developmental delay or
intellectual disability in 68%, abnormal neurologic findings in 48%, and
congenital anomalies apart from the CNS malformation in 18%. The main
malformations identified were heterotopic gray matter (19%), cortical tubers
(17%), focal cortical dysplasia (16%), polymicrogyria (16%), agyria/pachygyria
(15%), schizencephaly/cleft (5%), transmantle dysplasia (5%), and
hemimegalencephaly (4%). Eight patients had features of more than one
malformation. Most lesions were multilobar (47%), with the frontal lobe being
the most common lobe involved (78%). A total of 68% of patients had other
cerebral malformations including ventricular dilatation or dysmorphism (46%)
and abnormalities of the corpus callosum (29%). CONCLUSIONS: This study
illustrates the spectrum of MCD in a pediatric cohort and highlights some of
the differences between pediatric and adult patients. Patients with MCD
presenting in childhood have a wider spectrum of malformations and more varied,
often more severe, clinical manifestations. The lesions are frequently
multifocal or generalized and many are associated with noncortical
developmental brain anomalies.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Malformations of cerebral cortical
development are common anomalies of the brain, typically causing developmental
delay or seizures that are classically thought to begin in childhood. We
present clinical and MR imaging data of 16 patients with cortical malformations
in whom evidence of neurologic dysfunction was first noted in adulthood, and
attempt to determine whether these malformations had any differentiating
features from those presenting in childhood. METHODS: Imaging studies and
clinical records of 16 patients with adult-onset neurologic dysfunction were
reviewed retrospectively. The patients ranged in age from 17 to 64 years (mean
age, 35 years) at the time of imaging. Imaging findings were correlated with
seizure history. RESULTS: Fourteen patients had subependymal heterotopia (seven
women, seven men), and two patients had closed-lip schizencephalies. Eleven
patients had epilepsy, with age of onset ranging from 14 to 45 years (mean age,
22 years); four of them were successfully controlled by medication. The
remaining five patients had no seizure disorder. All patients, except one, had
normal intelligence. The bilaterality or multiplicity of location of
heterotopias was not associated with the presence or absence of seizures,
seizure frequency, or electroencephalographic results. CONCLUSION: Subependymal
heterotopia and small closed-lip schizencephaly may have minor clinical
manifestations that are not evident until adulthood, or may, occasionally,
never cause neurologic signs or symptoms whatsoever.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The authors report a female with syntelencephaly associated with a
connected transhemispheric cleft of focal cortical dysplasia. Syntelencephaly
is a rare anomaly characterized by fusion of the hemispheres in the posterior
frontal and parietal regions and is considered a new variant of
holoprosencephaly. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging of the patient revealed
syntelencephaly associated with bilateral fused clefts of focal cortical
dysplasia without the pial-ependymal seam, which was regarded as an incomplete
type of schizencephaly. The underlying mechanism is discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report on two sibs and two other unrelated patients with agenesis
of corpus callosum, oculocutaneous albinism, repeated infections, and
cardiomyopathy. All manifested postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, and
profound developmental delay. Additional central nervous system anomalies
present in at least one patient included hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis,
white matter neuronal heterotopia, or bilateral schizencephaly. Repeated viral,
bacterial, and fungal infections were consistent with a primary
immunodeficiency. However, immunological studies showed variable, nonspecific
findings. Cardiomyopathy with progressive heart failure or infection led to
death before age 2 years in three of the patients. This syndrome was first
described by Vici et al. [1988: Am. J. Med. Genet. 29:1-8]. The four patients
reported herein confirm this unique disorder. Affected sibs of both sexes born
to unaffected parents provide evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance.

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional reorganization of the brain can
result from congenital brain disorders as well as from brain infarction. The
purpose of our study was to use functional MR imaging to determine whether
reorganization of brain function occurs in patients with schizencephaly.
METHODS: Four patients with schizencephaly (three right-handed, one
ambidextrous) presented with seizures. Associated lesions included agenesis of
the corpus callosum (n = 1) and absence of the septum pellucidum (n = 1).
Functional MR imaging was performed in each patient using a single-section fast
low-angle shot (FLASH) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) technique at 1.5 T
in a standard head coil. The motor cortex was initially identified on an axial
T1-weighted anatomic image. Thirty consecutive images were obtained during a
motor task consisting of repetitive finger-to-thumb opposition. The percentage
of change in increased signal intensity was calculated for the primary motor
area. An ipsilateral activation index was used to compare the affected with the
unaffected hemisphere. RESULTS: The percentage of change in increased signal
intensity in the area of activation ranged from 4.8% +/- 0.9 to 9.2% +/- 1.2
(mean, 5.6% +/- 1.5). The ipsilateral activation index in the affected
hemisphere was 0.00 to 0.38, whereas that in the unaffected hemisphere was 15.4
to infinity. The difference in the ipsilateral activation index between each
hemisphere was considered significant. CONCLUSION: Our results showed increased
activation in the unaffected hemisphere in patients with schizencephaly, which
may reflect functional reorganization of the motor area in patients with this
congenital disorder.<p>

ABSTRACT:  INTRODUCTION: Neuroimaging and experimental studies have related
cytomegalovirus (CMV) to certain neuronal migration disorders. MATERIAL AND
METHODS: To define the electroclinical picture of children with epilepsy
associated with disorders of cortical development (DCD) and congenital CMV
infection, we conducted a clinical, electroencephalographic and
neuroradiological study of 10 children with this condition. RESULTS: Eighty per
cent of them had dismorphic traits, or malformations outside CNS. All showed
other neuroradiological signs (cerebral calcification, white matter damage,
porencephaly). Six patients with bihemispheric DCD (agyria-pachigyria, 2;
'poligyria', 1; schizencephaly, 1; bilateral opercular DCD, 2) showed:
Tetraparesis, severe or profound mental deficiency, early onset epilepsy (mean
age at onset: 11 months) with spasms, tonic seizures, partial seizures, and
multifocal paroxysms or unusual diffuse sharp Alfa-Beta EEG activity. One child
developed Epilepsia Partialis Continua. Children with bilateral opercular DCD
evolved to a continuous spike and wave (SW) electrical status during
wakefulness and sleep, linked to a worsening of psychomotor derangement. Four
patients with unilateral hemispheric DCD (pachigyric or 'poligyric') showed:
Congenital hemiparesis, mild intellectual deficiency, motor seizures
(orofacial, hemiclonic, generalized) beginning in the third year of live,
atypical absences with focal phenomena, frequent focal rhythmic SW discharges
during wakefulness, and continuous SW status during sleep (CSWS). CONCLUSIONS:
A wide spectrum of DCD due to congenital CMV infection is documented.
Characteristic electroclinical pictures related to the extent and topographical
distribution of the DCD are recognized, which may lead to an appropriate
diagnosis and prognosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The etiology and relationships between different forms of
malformations of cortical development are poorly understood. Schizencephaly is
generally regarded as unrelated to arachnoid cysts. As part of a systematic
study of epilepsy in twins we observed a monozygotic twin pair discordant for
temporal lobe epilepsy where the twin with epilepsy had unilateral temporal
schizencephaly and periventricular heterotopia. The twin without epilepsy had
an arachnoid cyst in the same temporal lobe. Although an incidental association
is possible, this observation, together with occasional reports of
schizencephaly and arachnoid cysts within one individual, suggests a shared
pathogenic mechanism. Schizencephaly can be caused by both genetic and acquired
factors. We propose that our observations in this twin pair are best explained
by a genetic factor present in both twins, with an additional environmental
insult resulting in schizencephaly in only one of the pair.<p>

ABSTRACT:  With the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
neuronal migration disorders (NMD), including lissencephaly, pachygyria,
polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, unilateral hemimegalencephaly and gray matter
heterotopia, are more frequently and easily diagnosed. When NMD is a diagnostic
consideration, MRI should be the imaging method of choice with the high
contrast between gray and white matter it provides and its high resolution
multiplanar display of anatomy. Magnetic resonance imaging displays the size,
configuration and distribution of cortical gyri and cortical thickness for the
evaluation of possible lissencephaly, pachygyri and polymicrogyri. It will
successfully demonstrate deposits of gray matter in abnormal locations when
gray matter heterotopias are present. With its multiplanar imaging capability,
MRI will demonstrate the cleft extending from the pial surface to the
ventricular ependyma whether the lips of the cleft are fused or separate, thus
providing the diagnosis of schizencephaly.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The role of inheritance in neuronal migrational disorders is under
intense investigation. Studies on neuronal migrational disorders (NMDs) from
developing countries that have a high rate of parental consanguinity are
lacking. The present study included 29 children (aged 15 days-12 years, mean
age 1.4 years) who were diagnosed to have NMDs, from a non-selected population
with seizures and non-selected population of cognitive developmental delay, in
the period January 1994 to April 1997. Seventeen (58.6 per cent) patients had
lissencephaly, four (13.8 per cent) patients had pachygyria, three (10.3 per
cent) patients had neuronal heterotopia, four (13.8 per cent) patients had
schizencephaly, one patient (3.4 per cent) had hemimegalencephaly, and 14 (48.2
per cent) patients with NMDs had other associated conditions. Lissencephalic
patients had a high rate of parental consanguinity (88.2 per cent) and family
history of possible similar cases (76.4 per cent). In conclusion, lissencephaly
is probably the commonest neuronal migrational disorder in communities with a
high rate of parental consanguinity, adding significant support to the
literature on the genetic aetiology of lissencephaly.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An infant is described who had a combination of lobar
holoprosencephaly and open-lip schizencephaly. Midline fusion of the basal
ganglia was associated with bilateral absence of abundant parts of the brain
mantle. Agenesis of the corpus callosum, hypoplasia of the optic nerves and
chiasm, absence of the septum pellucidum, posterior pituitary and olfactory
bulbs were further components of the malformation. Blindness, intractable
seizures, spastic tetraplegia, somatomental retardation and diabetes insipidus
were the main clinical features. A defect in the induction of the mediobasal
part of the prosencephalon and failure of cell proliferation can be responsible
for this complex malformation. Recent results of homeobox gene research
relevant to the development of the prosencephalon are discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Neuronal migration anomalies are a spectrum of brain malformations
caused by insults to migrating neuroblasts during the sixth week to fifth month
of gestation. To study the characteristics of MRI findings in migration
anomalies, MR images of 36 patients (28 children and 8 adults) with migration
anomalies were evaluated. Five patients had lissencephaly, eight had
pachygyria, twelve had schizencephaly, six had heterotopias of gray matter,
three had hemimegalencephaly, and two had polymicrogyria. The frequency of
migration anomalies was 0.51% of all cranial MRI studies and 1.21% of pediatric
cranial MRI studies at our hospital. The major clinical presentations of these
patients were seizure (64%), development delay (42%), motor deficits (42%) and
mental retardation (25%). Twenty-five patients (69%) associated with other
brain anomalies, including: other migration anomalies in 12 cases (33%),
absence of the septum pellucidum in 10 cases (28%), Dandy-Walker
malformation/variant in 5 cases, arachnoid cyst in 4 cases, agenesis of the
corpus callosum in 3 cases, holoprosencephaly in 2 cases, mega cisterna magna
in 1 case and cephalocele in 1 case. Some of them presented with multiple
complicated anomalies. As MR imaging provides superb gray-white matter
distinction, details of cortical anatomy and multiplanar capability, it can
clearly delineate the detail morphologic changes of the brain caused by
neuronal migration disorders as well as the associated anomalies.<p>

cases (24%) were found with a deep calcarine sulcus and prominent calcar avis.
These were bilateral in four patients, and unilateral in twenty. Fifteen of the
unilateral cases demonstrated a right-sided involvement, and remaining five
were left-sided. A deep calcarine sulcus and prominent calcar avis should be
distinguished from disorders of neuronal migration and organization such as
schizencephaly and heterotopia. Also, based on our findings in this study, we
speculate that it is the deep calcarine sulcus and prominent calcar avis which
creates the appearance of the so-called accessory occipital ventricle.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To present the fitest classification and the imaging
peculiarities of the malformations of cortical development, most of which have
been related with the epilepsy origin. METHODS: The study is based on an
anatomical-histological classification scheme that shows three great groups of
malformations of cortical development: 1. Malformations due to abnormal
neuronal and glial proliferation. 2. Malformations due to abnormal neuronal
migration. 3. Malformations due to abnormal cortical organization. RESULTS: The
result of these abnormalities of the cortical development is the presence of
several anatomical histological entities, actually perfectly identified by the
magnetic resonance (MR), especially with the new high resolution methods. The
most frequent entities, such as polymicrogyria, lissencephaly, pachygyria,
schizencephaly, cerebral heterotopia (cortical, subcortical or subependymal),
and other rarer types are reviewed according with the numerous references of
the literature and the findings observed in the cases of our series of about
one hundred patients which includes cases of every type of malformation.
CONCLUSION: MR is a conclusive study in order to identify and classify the
malformations of cortical development, most of which are associated with
neurological disturbances: epilepsy, mental retardation, language and/or
behavioral problems or motor dysfunction.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Neuronal migration disorders represent a group of congenital nervous
system malformations that affect the process whereby millions of
neuroectodermic cells move from germinal matrix to the loci, where they will
reside for life. They produce important changes in cytoarchitecture, lamination
and normal neuronal physiology, particularly in cerebral cortex. These
disorders appear as sporadic cases, genetically determined or caused by
external agents as infections, intoxications and radiations, etc. The better
identified nosological entities include: schizencephaly, lissencephaly,
pachygyria, polymicrogyria, neuronal heterotopias and agenesis of corpus
callosum. Patients usually present early symptoms and signs of disease and
epilepsy is a dominant manifestation. By means of studies of craneal computed
tomography (CCT), magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET),
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and immunohistochemical and
Golgi studies (IHG), it has been recently shown that nervous system dysgenesis
can be a frequent cause of many refractory epilepsies and epileptic syndromes
considered as cryptogenic. When these disorders are associated with dismorphic
stigmas, genetics syndromes such as Miller-Dieker, Zellweger and Aicardi should
be suspected.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The corpus callosum develops from anterior to posterior, starting at
the commissural plate of the lamina terminalis. We report a patient with
cortical dysplasia and schizencephaly, which apparently interfered with the
normal callosal development before 20 gestational weeks. The result was an
atypical callosal dysgenesis in which the anterior parts (including anterior
body, genu and rostrum) were absent while the remaining parts were developed.
This finding suggests that the commissural plate may not be the only region
where the corpus callosum starts to develop in some congenital brain
malformations.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Two children with left open-lip schizencephaly are reported.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was demonstrated on the second day of life in
Patient 1; in the other patient CMV infection was observed at the age of 4
years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed polymicrogyric cortex lining the
clefts. In Patient 2 polymicrogyria was also present in the corresponding area
contralateral to the schizencephaly. Computed tomography revealed the presence
of subependymal periventricular calcifications. Genetic analysis did not
demonstrate the presence of EMX2 homeobox gene. The possible role of CMV
infection in the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of schizencephaly is
therefore suggested.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Focal abnormalities of gyration (FAG) are developmental disorders
that may occur in isolated patients or, as in the case being reported, as part
of a familial disorder. Analysis of individuals in a family spanning three
generations was carried out using MRI. Abnormalities, present in all members of
generations II and III, included focal cortical dysplasia (three patients),
focal cortical infolding (two patients) and schizencephaly (one patient);
associated minor anomalies, such as white matter abnormalities, were seen in
the remaining three members of generations II and III. MRI recognition of FAG
in the family being reported proved useful in defining their phenotypical
expression and providing proper counselling for individual family members.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Brain malformations are rare congenital anomalies caused by neuronal
migration disorders or cerebral tissue destruction during gestation. And
epileptic disorders and psychomotor retardation are sometimes induced by them.
Previous understanding of these anomalies was derived from pathologic studies
after autopsy. The recent advancement of neuroimaging techniques, such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has allowed us to achieve a high diagnostic
capability of these malformations. These abnormalities have been more widely
recognized morphologically. However, cerebral function in these cases has been
rarely described. To evaluate the cerebral functional state in these anomalies,
123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) was performed in 3 cases with brain malformations and 22
normal controls. Several regions of interest (ROI) in the cortex were
determined, and the radioactivity at each ROI was counted. The regional
cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution was evaluated semiquantitatively by
calculating the cortico-cerebellar ratios at each ROI. A 23-year-old female
with schizencephaly (Case-1) and a 21-year-old male (Case-2) with
polymicrogyria showed increased rCBF in their abnormal cortices. And a
39-year-old male with porencephaly (Case-3) demonstrated severely decreased
rCBF in his abnormal cortex with gliosis which was considered to be a result
from a secondarily disturbed neuronal migration after tissue destruction during
gestation. Furthermore, abnormal rCBF distribution was observed in their
morphologically normal cortices in addition to their abnormal cortices compared
to normal controls. Case-2 showed decreased cerebral perfusion in the
morphologically normal cortex around his abnormal cortex with increased rCBF,
suggesting surrounding suppression associated with epileptic foci. In contrast,
the lesions with decreased rCBF in Case-1 were not around the abnormal
cortices. In the cortices with decreased rCBF, despite morphologically normal
imaging, of Case-3, the decrement was considered to be diaschisis, since these
lesions were located in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the tissue defect. We
concluded that brain malformations show various rCBF abnormalities, and these
are spread over a larger area than detected by MRI. Therefore, SPECT is a
valuable examination method for the determination of abnormal areas and the
assessment of pathologic functional state in patients with brain
malformations.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report here that some patients affected by schizencephaly are
heterozygous for mutations in EMX2, a homeobox gene implicated in the
patterning of the developing forebrain. Schizencephaly is a very rare human
congenital disorder characterized by a full-thickness cleft within the cerebral
hemispheres. Large portions of these may be absent and replaced by
cerebrospinal fluid. We previously reported the presence of EMX2 mutations in 7
out of 8 sporadic cases of schizencephaly. We now extend this analysis to 10
additional patients, including 2 brothers. Six patients were found to be
heterozygous for de novo mutations in EMX2. In particular, the 2 brothers show
the same mutation affecting the splicing of the first intron, while this
mutation is absent in their parents and in the 2 unaffected siblings.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of schizencephaly with fused lips has
been reported in few cases. In all of the previously reported cases, temporal
lobectomy was selected as a major surgical treatment, except for one case with
cortical resection. We present a case of direct resection of dysplastic walls
of the schizencephalic cleft and the surrounding epileptic area. CASE: This
20-year-old college student with medication-resistant epilepsy was surgically
treated by subpial cortical resection of the epileptogenic area around a
schizencephalic cleft. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an unilateral
schizencephalic cleft with fused lips in the right parietal lobe. Pathologic
examination demonstrated dysplastic neurons in the epileptogenic cortex.
Intraoperative electrocorticography clearly detected epileptiform discharges
around the cleft, and the epileptogenic lesion was completely resected. He has
been seizure-free for 1 year since the operation and he has no neurologic
deficits. CONCLUSION: Subpial resection of the dysplastic cortex surrounding
the cleft under the guide of electrocorticography is an effective and minimally
invasive procedure for the treatment of schizencephaly.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In 1926, Foix, Chavany and Marie described an acquired syndrome of
fasciopharyngoglossomasticatory diplegia resulting from bilateral infarction of
the anterior operculum. Clinical features consisted of facial diplegia,
dysarthria, pseudobulbar palsy, mild to severe mental retardation, and
seizures. A developmental form, similar in presentation in adults with MRI
findings consisting of bilateral perisylvian cortical malformation consistent
with polymicrogyria involving the sylvian fissure and opercular cortex, has
been recognized; but few pediatric cases of congenital bilateral perisylvian
syndrome (CBPS) have been reported. Over the past four years, we have
encountered 12 cases of CBPS presenting in childhood. Age ranges were from 1
week to 11 years with a median of 2.25 years; six were less than two years of
age. Seven were male and five female. Ten had bilateral perisylvian
polymicrogyria on MRI; two had unilateral perisylvian schizencephaly with
contralateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. Clinical manifestations included
developmental delay in 7; poor palatal function in 5; hypotonia in 4;
arthrogryposis in 4; hemiparesis in 3; apnea in 3; paraparesis in 2;
micrognathia in 2; pectus excavatum in 2; quadriparesis in 1; and hearing loss
in 1. Seizures occurred in seven (58%) and consisted of infantile spasms (n =
1), generalized tonic-clonic (n = 1), complex partial (n = 2), partial motor (n
= 2; 1 with secondary generalization), and febrile convulsions (n = 1). CBPS
has different manifestations in the pediatric population than in adults. CBPS
is more common than previously thought, is recognizable by MRI and should be
suspected clinically in any infant or child presenting with oromotor
dysfunction/pseudobulbar signs and developmental delay, especially if there are
associated congenital malformations. Epilepsy is not a constant feature in the
pediatric presentation and is variable in type and severity.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Schizencephaly is a rare disorder of brain development resulting in
the formation of abnormal unilateral or bilateral clefts in the cerebral
hemispheres. It is often accompanied by partial seizures, mental retardation,
and hemiparesis. Two patients are described with clear psychotic symptoms with
either unilateral or bilateral schizencephaly. The implications of the
association between schizencephaly and psychosis in these patients for
understanding the biology of the psychoses are discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Among the variable manifesting conditions of neuronal migration
disorders, mental retardation, motor disturbance and epilepsy are the main
features of developmental disabilities. We analyzed the relationship between
clinical symptoms and magnetic resonance (MR) images, including surface anatomy
scan (SAS). Thirty nine patients (23 males, 16 females; mean age 6.1 years)
with neuronal migration disorders were studied. The diagnoses were cerebral
palsy in 23 cases, mental retardation in 4. West syndrome in 4, Fukuyama type
congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) in 6. Walker-Warburg syndrome in 1 and
Dubowitz syndrome in 1. Cortical dysplasias were classified into the following
7 groups, mainly based on the SAS findings: complete agyria (AG 1), mixture of
agyria and pachygyria (AG 2), bilateral complete pachygyria (BP 1), diffuse
pachygyria with marked widening of the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (BP 2),
unilateral pachygyria with hemispheric atrophy or hemimegalencephaly UP), focal
cortical dysplasia (FP) and other findings such as solitary schizencephaly
(Others). Most cases of AG 1 and AG 2 showed spastic quadriplegia (6/7) and
symptomatic generalized epilepsy (5/7), whereas cases of BP1 showed spasticity
only in 1/8 and epilepsy in 7/8. Hemiplegia was observed in 6/7 of UP, 2/8 of
FP and 2/4 of Others. Partial epilepsy was observed in 2/7 of UP and 1/8 of FP.
Intellectual level was variable in BP 1, UP, FP and Others, but all cases
showed severe mental retardation in AG 1, AG 2 and BP 2. BP 2 was observed in
all cases of typical FCMD (5/5). The birth weight was less than 2,500 g in 6/7
of UP. The structural findings well correlated with clinical symptoms and
epileptic seizure types. The surface anatomy scan was a very useful technique
for detecting cortical dysplasias.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The mechanism of mirror movements in two patients was investigated;
one with congenital mirror movement, the other with schizencephaly.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation on one side elicited motor evoked potentials
(MEPs) in their thenar muscles on both sides with almost the same latencies,
minimal thresholds, and cortical topographies. During voluntary contraction of
the thenar muscle on one side, contralateral transcranial magnetic stimulation
induced a silent period not only on the voluntary contraction side but on the
mirror movement side and of the same duration. By contrast, ipsilateral
transcranial magnetic stimulation elicited MEPs without silent periods in both
muscles. With intended unilateral finger movements, an H2(15)O-PET activation
study showed that the regional cerebral blood flow increased predominantly in
the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, as seen in normal subjects, although
mirror movements occurred. It is considered that the ipsilateral motor cortex
plays a major part in the generation of mirror movements, which may be induced
through the ipsilateral uncrossed corticospinal tract.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Schizencephaly is an uncommon congenital disorder of cerebral
cortical development. Although a well-recognized cause of seizures and
developmental deficits in children, previous reports describe the range of
neurodevelopmental outcome in only 47 patients. We report the clinical and
cranial imaging features of 47 children with unilateral open-lip (17),
unilateral closed-lip (12), bilateral open-lip (12), and bilateral closed-lip
(6) schizencephaly, as defined radiologically. The schizencephalic cleft
occurred more often in the anterior than in the posterior neocortex. Children
with closed-lip schizencephaly presented with hemiparesis or motor delay
whereas patients with open-lip schizencephaly presented with hydrocephalus or
seizures. Forty-three patients (91%) had associated cerebral developmental
anomalies, most commonly absence of the septum pellucidum (45%) and focal
cortical dysplasia (40%). There was a history of seizures in 57% of cases, a
third of which were classified as difficult to control. Neurodevelopmental
outcome was generally poor, with 51% of patients (24/47) having severe
deficits, 32% of patients (15/47) having moderate impairment, and 17% of
patients (8/47) having mild or no problems. Patients with closed-lip
schizencephaly were more likely to have a mild to moderate outcome than those
with open-lip type (78% versus 31%; p &lt; 0.05). Children with unilateral
schizencephaly had a mild or moderate outcome more frequently than those with
bilateral lesions (62% versus 28%; p &lt; 0.05). Children who had involvement
of a single lobe accounted for 88% of those with mild outcomes and 53% of those
with moderate outcomes. Unilateral closed-lip schizencephaly was associated
with the best neurodevelopmental outcome; in contrast, 11 of 12 children with
bilateral open-lip clefts had severe disabilities. Language development was
significantly more likely to be normal in those children with unilateral
schizencephaly than in those with bilateral clefts (48% versus 6%; p &lt;
0.002). Thus, the presentation and outcome of children with schizencephaly are
quite variable but are related to the extent of cortex involved in the
schizencephalic defect.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We describe two brothers aged 8 and 10 affected by severe bilateral
schizencephaly, carrying an identical point mutation of the homeobox gene EMX2.
Both children had severe neurologic deficits and mental retardation, although
they differed in the anatomic extent of the brain malformation and in the
severity of the clinical picture. The present findings, together with the
reported cases of schizencephaly associated with EMX2 mutations, support the
hypothesis that, at least in some cases, schizencephalies are determined by
deleterious mutations of this homeobox gene. The different morphoclinical
pictures suggest that, besides the EMX2 mutation, other factors are relevant in
determining the severity of the brain malformation and clinical picture.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Two patients are presented with large cerebral schizencephalic
clefts and large temporal arachnoid cysts. Neuropathological studies suggest
that arachnoid cysts may either arise due to an aberration in the formation of
the subarachnoid space or by its splitting. A recently proposed theory for the
formation of schizencephaly is that this condition is an extreme variant of
cortical dysplasia, in which the infolding of cortex extends all the way into
the lateral ventricle. In light of these data, and based on the imaging
findings in our two patients with large cerebral schizencephalic clefts and
large temporal arachnoid cysts, we propose that the mechanism which causes
schizencephaly (deep cortical infolding) may lead to some kind of a traction
effect and splitting of the leptomeninges resulting in the formation of an
arachnoid cyst adjacent to the schizencephalic cleft. This appears to be a
significant observation because the pathogenesis of arachnoid cysts is still
controversial.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The purpose of this study was to introduce the use of
three-dimensional (3D) surface MR imaging display for clinical use. Surface
display was created using images acquired with T1 magnetization prepared rapid
acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) in 24 cases of migrational defects, cortical
dysplasia and prenatal asphyxia. Schizencephaly and cortical dysplasia were
pathologically confirmed. The precise configurations of cortical abnormalities,
and their relation to the adjacent gyri and sulci were demonstrated. The
topography of schizencephalic clefts was clearly defined. The appearance of
ulegyria was characteristic and it was sometimes possible to differentiate
polymicrogyria from pachygyria.<p>

ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: Nine patients affected by schizencephaly were analyzed, and
the epileptologic findings prospectively studied, to define the relations
between the anatomic brain malformations and clinical outcome. METHODS: The
schizencephaly was diagnosed by means of magnetic resonance imaging (eight
cases) or computed tomography (one case). The clinical histories of all the
patients were analyzed, and a psychometric evaluation was made. The
electroclinical features and course of epilepsy in the six patients with
epilepsy were prospectively followed up for a period ranging from 3 to 14
years. RESULTS: The patients were divided into those who were unilaterally
(six) and those bilaterally (three) affected. The former were characterized by
mild neurologic deficits and late-onset epilepsy; their epileptologic features
were consistent in terms of age of onset, seizure semiology, the absence of
secondary generalization, and resistance to antiepileptic treatment. The
patients with bilateral schizencephaly associated with other brain
malformations were characterized by severe neurologic deficits but were only
rarely affected by epilepsy, which was always completely controlled by
antiepileptic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the extent of anatomic
malformation is strictly related to the severity of motor and mental impairment
but not to the presence or severity of epilepsy. The absence of prenatal risk
factors for brain damage in our series, previously described familial cases of
schizencephaly, and the recent report of mutations in homeobox gene EMX2
associated with cases of schizencephaly all indicate that genetic factors may
play a key role in the pathogenesis of this brain malformation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 9-month-old infant had unilateral closed-lip schizencephaly in the
right parietal lobe, which coexisted with an arteriovenous malformation in the
nearby temporal area. Cranial MR showed a right parietal cleft lined with gray
matter between the right lateral ventricle and the subarachnoid space, and
cluster hypointensities throughout the right temporal lobe. Cerebral
angiography revealed a right temporal arteriovenous malformation with feeding
arteries arising from the right middle and posterior cerebral arteries and
draining into the right sigmoid sinus via the engorged vein of Labbe.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Two children with neuronal migration disorders and unexpectedly mild
clinical symptoms are reported. The first patient was followed with the
diagnosis of febrile convulsion and seizures associated with fever for 14
years. Computed tomography scans were normal. Although periodic slow waves of
the left parietal cortex were detected on the first two electroencephalograms,
his latest examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging performed at 16
years of age disclosed a left parietal schizencephaly extending between the
parietal cortex and corpus callosum. The second patient was followed with the
diagnosis of febrile convulsion for 2 years and later experienced afebrile
seizures. On his latest visit, a posterior parietal pachygyric region and a
parieto-occipital island heterotopia on the left hemisphere were diagnosed by
magnetic resonance imaging. We believe that review of these patients, at the
mildest end of the clinical spectrum of neural migration disorders, will
contribute to a new understanding of the correlation between clinical and
pathologic findings of neuronal migration disorders.<p>

ABSTRACT:  It is generally accepted that there are two subsets of septo-optic
dysplasia (deMorsier's syndrome), one with schizencephaly and the other without
schizencephaly. A third form of the anomaly which is associated with callosal
absence has also been described. Except for schizencephaly, the association of
septo-optic dysplasia with another major type of disorder of neuronal migration
and organization such as cortical dysplasia, has not yet been reported. We
report the MR imaging examination of a 3-year-old patient with bilateral
rolandic cortical dysplasia, and with apparent thinning of the optic nerves,
and absent septum pellucidum (septo-optic dysplasia) as a new combination. This
can be labelled as cortico-septo-optic dysplasia.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: Septo-optic dysplasia, which consists of the association
of the hypoplasia of the optic nerves and the agenesis of the septum
pellucidum, is frequently associated with deficiency of hypothalamic releasing
factors. In Magnetic Resonance (MR) of these patients, anomalies in the form
and size of the pituitary stalk, adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis are found.
Some cases show schizencephaly and it has been proposed as an added component
of the syndrome by some authors. This fact has been refuted by others. PATIENTS
AND METHODS: We present the clinical and neuroanatomic revision of six children
with septo-optic dysplasia studied by MR imaging over the last five years in
our Department of Neuropediatrics. The aim was, that through the
neuroembryological discussion of the morphopathological aspects of the
patients, to determine the malformation and the time in which the injury, which
was the underlying cause, occurred. RESULTS: From the six cases, in two only
disruptive signs were evident with the optic nerves being affected
asymmetrically, disruption of the corpus callosum, falx cerebri indemnity and
effects in the cortex conformation. This was opposed to the dysgenic features
in the other four cases which had no disruptive features. CONCLUSIONS: Our
findings suggest that this entity could be the result of at least two different
pathogenic processes, that is, a minor form of holoprosencephaly (dysgenesis)
or a disruption which, therefore, occurs later in gestation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Schizencephaly is a rare developmental disorder characterized by a
full thickness cleft within the cerebral hemispheres. Large portions of the
cerebral hemispheres may be missing and are replaced by cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). The walls of the clefts are lined by polymicrogyric grey matter and are
covered by the so-called "pialependymal seam". The cleft may be unilateral or
bilateral, and if bilateral are fairly symmetrical. Their dimensions can be
small or large. The clinical features may vary from a normal to a severe
development delay. 13 patients with this anomaly have been evaluated. Using
SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) analysis, as previously
described (2), they were found to have a mutant homeobox gene, Emx2.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We present a case with a characteristic magnetic resonance image
(MRI) of bilateral open-lipped schizencephaly and atypical clinical
presentation. The patient is still alive and in good health in her forties, she
has never presented seizures, and although the motor dysfunction is well
correlated with cerebral lobe involvement, neurobehavioral dysfunction is not
proportional to the MR image of the cerebral malformation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Neuroimaging is playing an increasingly important role in the
evaluation of patients with malformations of cerebral cortical development. In
this review, the authors address optimal neuroimaging of cortical malformations
using x-ray computed tomography, single-photon-emission computed tomography,
positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. Initially, the authors discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of the various imaging techniques. This is followed by a discussion
of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of several different imaging
manifestations of focal malformations of cortical development, including
polymicrogyria, focal subcortical heterotopia, schizencephaly, focally
thickened gyri, focally irregular gyri, hemimegalencephaly, and transmural
dysplasia. The authors intend that, after reading this review, the reader will
have a better understanding of the optimal neuroimaging techniques for
evaluating these malformations and their many neuroimaging appearances.<p>
