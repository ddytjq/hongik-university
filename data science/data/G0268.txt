In 1921, having been granted permission by the Dalai Lama, British climbers made the first attempt
to ascend Mt. Everest.  Legendary mountaineer George Mallory was present on that climb and two
expeditions that followed in the next three years.  When asked why he wanted to climb Everest,
Mallory replied, “Because it is there.”  Mt. Everest was like a third pole of the earth; the other two
had been conquered more than a decade earlier by Peary and Amundsen.  It was not fame or fortune
that drove Mallory up the mountain, but rather the drive to excel, a restless spirit that can be both a
blessing and a trap. <P>

Mallory was driven by an ambition that proved fatal.  In 1924, he and his climbing partner,
Andrew Irvine, perished on the north face of Mt. Everest.  Seventy-five years later, Mallory’s
body was positively identified and buried by a team sponsored by the NOVA television program.
Whether Mallory and Irvine reached the summit 29 years before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay
returned from Everest in 1953 remains the greatest mystery in mountaineering. <P>

What was it that drew Peter, James, and John to climb a high mountain?  In this first-century
expedition, the gospel writers tell us that Jesus was the leader, taking his disciples up the mountain.
According to Luke, Jesus went up the mountain to pray.  Humility, not hubris, motivated this trek. 
“Why climb the mountain?” the disciples might have asked Jesus.  We can imagine Jesus answering,
“Because God is there.” <P>

The disciples must have been excited to go on a hike with Jesus.  Their teacher was leading them with
a purpose.  They had cast aside their fishing nets to follow and learn from Jesus.  Bumbling but eager,
they followed where their master led.  Like the students of a cherished professor, they thought that
Jesus must have the answers to their deepest questions. <P>

But these students were not the smartest of their class.  They struggled with the concepts, they doubted,
they misunderstood.  Six days earlier, Jesus had explained that he would undergo great suffering, be killed,
and be resurrected.  Peter found this too much to believe, and he took Jesus aside to rebuke him.
Jesus replied, “Get behind me, Satan!  For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.” 
Jesus went on to explain what it means to be a disciple: “If any want to become my followers, let them
deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.” <P>

Six days later, Peter was trying his best to keep his mind on divine things, and wondering about the
cross, while following his teacher and fellow students up the mountain.  It must have been a long hike.
Modern scholars identify the peak with 9200-foot Mt. Hermon, the sentinel of the Golan Heights.
From this peak, one has a panoramic view of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel.  The Sea of Galilee, where
the first disciples were called, is a sapphire oval in the valley.  On reaching the summit, the disciples
would have been exultant. <P>

Then something terrifying happened on the mountain.  In a split second, God changed the world for
those mountaineers.  Unlike the Mallory expedition of 1924, however, these climbers returned to tell
the story. <P>

Let us try to put ourselves in the disciples’ shoes as we hike up the mountain with a favorite teacher.
It was probably a beautiful fall day, the air was crisp, the hike arduous.  After snapping some photographs
at the summit, passing around the canteen, and eating a snack, we lay down to rest.  Then a terrifying
vision appears before our eyes: our teacher begins glowing brighter than any earthly white.  His face
shines, his clothes radiate.  Moses and Elijah suddenly appear and begin talking with the glowing professor. <P>

If Jesus’ rebuke six days earlier didn’t scare the devil out of Peter, the transfiguration might have done so. <P>

Why climb the mountain?  Why follow Christ?  Why bear the cross? <P>

Astronomers climb mountains to gain a closer view of the heavens.  As an astrophysicist, I’ve
experienced the exultation of a brilliant sky filled with unearthly glow, the light from millions of stars
shining forth in the heavens.  King David spoke for astronomers as well as poets in Psalm 8, “When I
look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have established:
what are human beings that you are mindful of them, mortals that you care for them?”  The awe that
I feel under a dark, starlit sky brings me closer to God. <P>

Sometimes astronomers climb the mountain to see deeper inside rather than farther away.   Like Peter,
many of us - astronomers and others - struggle with concepts, misunderstanding, and doubt.  We climb
metaphorical mountains in search of a clearer vision for our own lives. <P>

This trip wasn’t the first time that Jesus had spoken to his disciples on a mountain.  In his Sermon on the
Mount, Jesus seems to anticipate the transfiguration and to explain its significance.  In one of my favorite
passages of the Bible, in Matthew 5, Jesus says to his disciples, “You are the light of the world.  A city
built on a hill cannot be hid.  No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the
lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.  In the same way, let your light shine before others, so
that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven.” <P>

In the Lutheran church, at the conclusion of a baptism, a member of the congregation presents a candle
to the newly baptized to symbolize the transfiguring light of the Holy Spirit.  The congregant then advises
the new disciple, “Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and glorify
your father in heaven.” As followers of Christ, we learn to shine like Jesus. <P>

Jesus’ transfiguration on the mountain was foreshadowed by his own baptism. The gospel of Mark
begins with the preparation of Jesus’ ministry by John the Baptist.  At Jesus’ baptism, Mark writes,
“just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending
like a dove on him.  And a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am
well pleased.’” <P>

Let’s return to the top of Mount Hermon, nearly two thousand years ago.  Moses, the bringer of the
law, and Elijah, the prophet of Israel, have joined the luminous Jesus.  Moses himself had climbed the
mountain, and when he came down with the tablets of the law his face was shining so that the Israelites
were afraid to come near him.  Elijah had ascended into heaven in a chariot of fire, the lights glowing
brightly around him.  There they were now, talking with Jesus, before Peter, James, and John. <P>

Peter is scared out of his wits.  What in the world is he to do?  Back in the first century, he couldn’t
just pull out his cell phone and call 911. <P>

The transfiguration may have occurred during the time of the Jewish Festival of Booths, or Sukkoth.
God had instructed Moses to build a tabernacle, or booth, as a sanctuary where He might live among
the Israelites as they wandered in the desert.  Maybe Peter was feeling a little guilty about not having
constructed his booth.  If so, Peter’s response to the heavenly shock he received is understandable. <P>

But Peter made a mistake.  Jesus was not equal with Moses and Elijah.  Moses and Elijah were not
gods to live in a tabernacle, nor was Jesus.  Jesus was the word made flesh; he was the light of the
world.  Jesus was God emptying himself by taking the form of a man and dying for us on the cross.
Jesus himself had explained his relation to Moses and Elijah in the Sermon on the Mount:  “Do not think
that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.”   In Luke’s
account of the transfiguration, Moses and Elijah discuss Jesus’ upcoming departure in Jerusalem.
On the mountain, all three were gathered in a foretelling of Christ’s resurrection. <P>

Peter was slow to understand the pending resurrection, but God instructed him.  Speaking from a
bright cloud, God called, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” <P>

Why climb the mountain?  Because it is there - or because God is there? <P>

Jesus climbed the mountain to pray, and so can we.  He also wanted his disciples to learn.  Through
him, we, too, are transfigured.  As St. Paul says in today’s second reading, “For it is God who said,
‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” <P>

We all have mountains to climb.  Let Jesus be our light, our guide, and our savior. <P>

Amen. <P>
