<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">Historical Note</a></h2>
<p>
Road America is one of the oldest road courses in the United States.
Elkhart Lake was, much as was
<a href="WatkinsGlen.html">Watkins Glen,</a>
a summer resort area much favored
by, among others, gentlemen sports-car drivers from around Chicago.
Open-road races were held from 1950 through 1952 on the highways through and
around Elkhart Lake, with many of the founding and early members of SCCA's
Chicago Region taking part in these races.
Following the disastrous crash by Pierre Levegh's Mercedes-Benz into the crowd
at Le Mans in 1953, many states -- including Wisconsin -- passed legislation
banning racing on public roads, and the Elkhart Lake road races were no more.
</p>
<p>
Road America was built in 1955 as a replacement venue, by a corporation headed
by Cliff Tufte and financed largely by Chicago Region members.
The first race was held in September of 1955.
Races drew large and enthusiastic crowds during the 1950s and 1960s, although
there were only two or three events held each year, all organized by the
Chicago Region of the SCCA.
Confounding the pollsters and demographics experts, more than 90% of the
attendees at these races came from within 50 miles of the track.
</p>
<p>
By the mid-1970s the track began to need additional sources of income, and
began to more events there each year, and events held by other organizations.
The Milwaukee and Chicago Regions of the
<a href="/Organizations/SCCA/">
SCCA
</a>
began to hold Drivers' Schools, Regionals, and more Nationals and Professional
series races, and the
<a href="/Organizations/MCSCC/">
Midwestern Council
</a>
also began to race there, and various marque clubs began to hold events there.
Currently the AMA, CART, IMSA, and the SCCA hold spectator Professional series
races at Road America every year, some of which are televised.
With the advent of more Professional series racing, the competitor's and
spectator's facilities have undergone continuous improvement, and Road America
remains today one of the premier road racing tracks in the world.

<h2><a name="RacersGuide">A Racers' Guide to Road America</a></h2>
<p>
Enter the track at the Competitor's Gate, about a hundred feet west of the main
gate (Gate 1) and just west of the farmhouse.
There are three metal buildings west of this entrance, registration is in the
center building and Tech in the one to the east (closest to the farmhouse).
</p>
<p>
After leaving registration, proceed through the gate in the fence just west of
the barn -- you're usually asked to show your credentials there -- then west
(right) along the access road to the covered bridge over the track, cross the
bridge (it's wider than it looks but not by much), and follow the access road
back east to the steep hill leading up to the paddock areas.
At spectator events, you'll be asked for your credentials again here.
(In the evenings, the access road may be open directly across the track.)
It is not necessary to cross the track surface to enter and leave the paddocks.
</p>
<p>
There are four named paddock areas at Road America; the grassy area to the east
at the bottom of the hill is the North Paddock; the grassy area with paved
access roads at the top of the hill is the Competition Paddock; the paved area
to the south and east is the New Paddock; and the grassy area to the south and
west is the South Paddock (used only for that June SCCA National with the
copyrighted name).
If you set up in the New Paddock, do not spill oil or gasoline onto, and do not
poke holes into, the paved surface.
There are two pit areas, along the Competition Paddock and the New Paddock;
competitors are sometimes required to use only the New Pits.
The paddock areas can conveniently accomodate four hundred competitors while
leaving plenty of room for spectator parking.
</p>
<p>
Leaded and unleaded racing fuel are available at the station near the center
of the Competition Paddock, and the tire concessions are located just southwest
of the gas station.
Water is available along the pit fence in the Competition Paddock.
The sanitary facilities at Road America are archaic (yes, they are the pits).
The food from the concession buildings at each end of the Competition Paddock is
very good -- in fact, it's legendary; but as with most legends, does not quite
measure up to expectations.
Air is available from the tire concessions, and there is a souvenir stand which
carries film and ice.
Additional food and souvenir stands are open around the entire track property
during spectator events.
The medical building is south of the concession stand at the south end of the
competition Paddock.
Scales are located in the impound area, behind and near the center of the
Competition Pits.

This "Hot Lap" was written by James Furstenburg of the wheeltowheel
mailing list.
<p>
Here goes...I do not consciously keep track of a lot of detailed
markers so these may look more like general impressions.  I hope
they help some...I am by no means a pro driver...your mileage may vary.
</p>
<p>
Remember that I am driving a mini-cooper vintage race car on 10'
diameter A008s and my braking and handling will not be the same as
more modern cars with brake rotors over 7.5" and useful rear brakes.
</p>
<p>
General notes: Road America is 4 miles per lap, 14 corners.  Three
flat out straights.  From various club schools and skip barber,
there are orange marks at the apexes [editor's note: the orange marks
disappeared with the 1995 repaving of the track, but may reappear
at a later date -- rpw].  Usually these are a little
late for the safety of the students.
</p>
<p>
RA has several high speed corners...these are the important ones.
There are several slow corners which are throwaways
</p>
<p>
The throwaways are corners 5,6 and 8.
</p>
<p>
The most important fast corners are 7, the carousel, the Kink 13 and
14.
</p>
<p>
Starting from Corner 14 (the last) instead of the end of the pits
because it is more representative.
</p>
<p>
From 14 you end up on the front or pit straight. The straight is
uphill for a good portion so you gain speed somewhat gradually until
it levels out about 60% of the way to 1. I will close to my maximum
speed (say 110-115) entering the braking area.  You can brake later
than you initially think.  Braking at the 3 marker is pretty safe.
Corner 1 is wide and fast and for me is taken in third gear, turning
in at about the apex or a little late.  Apex slightly before the orange marks
on the pavement.
</p>
<p>
You drift out to the exit and slowly get back toward the center.
There is a short straight stretch here and a very slight bend
(corner 2) which can be ignored if you got back toward the center of
the track to concentrate on corner 3.  Corner 3, although slower
than 1 is still a 3d gear corner for me and pretty wide.  Again a
slightly late apex is preferable.  Drift out all the way...trying to
maintain as much speed a possible, you are no entering the fastest
straight.
</p>
<p>
Drift toward the center of track crossing under the bridge.  There
is a slight ben in the track (corner 4) which can be treated as the
straight.  This straight is downhill and very fast.  You want to
keep to the right as you approach the slowest corner on the track,
turn 5. Go in as deep as you dare.  I dare around 3.5 to 4. This is
a good place to outbrake someone to pass. 2d gear for me.
</p>
<p>
From 5 to 6 is a steep uphill climb, a good place to pass if you
took 5 correctly and have lots of power.
</p>
<p>
Turn 6 is slow (2d gear, sometimes 3d) and the apex is blind under
the bridge.  Either brake early before the car starts to rise over
the crest of after you come down.  You have very short time to brake
for the corner if you wait till you come back down on the
suspension. Apex late and stand on it.
</p>
<p>
Short shift to 3d or stay in 3d and stay flat on the power.  Turn 7
is a right hand sweeper which looks like you should lift or brake
and if you do not hit the apex you should have lifted or braked.  If
you take the corner correctly it is flat out. Apex is not late here.
</p>
<p>
Coming out of 7 you will be going downhill flat out toward 8.  I am
able to get into 4th gear here briefly, before breaking real hard
around 1.5 marker to 2 for 8.  8 is a slow 2d or maybe 3d gear
corner,depending on gearing. The stretch between 7 and 8 is also
good for passing and outbraking.
</p>
<p>
After you have drifted wide for 8 get toward the left center of
track to set up for the entrance to the Carousel, I am in third for
the entrance turn 9, when in the carousel stay a cars width toward
the center of the track and slowly track inward until you can see
the exit, then stand on it.  The Carousel is pretty fast.  I am at
6600 to 7000 in third through the corner.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I straighten out at the exit of the Carousel I am in 4th
gear and accelerating hard toward turn 11, the Kink.  Passing also
occurs sometimes in this straight if someone has enough power.
</p>
<p>
The kink is a very fast 4th gear right hand corner. If I take it
just right, I can stay on the power all the way through the corner
and not lift.  If I don't feel too great that day, I may lift or tap
the brakes. I apex right on the alligator teeth on the inside, they
are very small and do not upset the car.  DO NOT LIFT OR BRAKE ONCE
YOU ARE IN THE CORNER OR IT WILL COST YOU A BUNDLE! It is very
important to take the kink fast as it sets you up for the next
fastest straight on the course.
</p>
<p>
Turn 11A is a gentle bend to the right and left and can be taken
without lifting.  I brake around 3 to 4 for corner 12, a 2d or 3d
gear corner.  Going into 12 or Canada Corner is a great place to
pass.  Although if you do not take the corner smoothly, you will be
passed coming out.
</p>
<p>
After you straighten out, get back toward the right side of the
track to set up for 13.  You are going uphill from 12 to 13 and the
apex at 13 is blind and under a bridge. You turn in late and under
the bridge and by the way turn 13 is flat out if you take it
correctly.  You will then drift out all the way to the grass, (just
where Paul Tracy lost it last year and ended up near a motor home)
Stay on the gas and get back to the left to enter 14, you may
upshift to 4th here (or you may not). Tap the brakes sort of hard
and late, I use no markers here, just judgment, as you enter 14 and
apex a little late.  Try to maintain as much speed
as possible to get up the big hill on the main straight.
</p>
<p>
Well, that was fun, I can't wait to try it for real around the 20th
of May at the SVRA event.

<p>
In addition to malls and other shopping in Sheboygan along Route 23, there are
franchise restaurants and drive-ins, grocery stores, hardware stores, and
variety and department stores in the east side of Plymouth along Business Route
23 (about a mile south of Route 23) between Route 57 and downtown.
Stores and restaurants tend to close early in this area and to be closed all
day on Sunday; the Fleet and Farm in Plymouth at the northwest corner of Route
57 and Business Route 23 is an exception, and they have discount street gasoline
available.
Reasonably-priced street gasoline is also available in Plymouth at some stations
on Business Route 23 and on Route 57 south.
</p>
<p>
Accomodations for those planning to stay in the area can be a serious problem.
Although much of this area's income is from tourism, there is a surprising lack
of accomodations conveniently nearby.
What motels and resorts there are tend to have high non-racing occupancies
during most of the summer, and the additional lodging requirements of a race
weekend are for between 100 and 400 additional rooms for participants alone.
For spectator events early confirmed reservations are a must.
</p>
<p>
This list was last updated during September of 1992, using information from the
AAA Tour Books, race entry forms, various motel chain accomodation guides,
county Chamber of Commerce maps, regional telephone directories, and personal
observation.  The list is organized essentially by increasing distance from
the track.
</p>
<p>
There are three resorts on Elkhart Lake.
Take Route 67 north (left) from the track about 2.5 miles to County C in
Elkhart Lake; turn left and cross the railroad tracks, then turn left again
onto County J.
The establishments are two or three blocks ahead:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Siebken's Resort -- (414) 876-2600
<li>Barefoot Bay -- (800) 345-7784, (414) 876-3323
<li>Osthoff -- (414) 876-3366
</ul>
<p>
In Plymouth are two Bed-and-Breakfast operations, both about 5 miles from the
track:
</p>
<ul>
<li>52 Stafford, just south of the Business Route 23 - Stafford intersection (a
traffic light) about 2 miles west of Route 57 -- (800) 421-4667, (414) 893-0552
<li>Yankee Hill, at 315 Collins, two blocks west of the Business Route 23 -
Collins intersection (about 1.8 miles west of Route 57; Collins bears south
here as Business Route 23 bears north) -- (414) 892-2222
</ul>
<p>
Plymouth has an AmericInn, about 5.5 miles from the track, a mile west of
Route 57 on Business Route 23 at County E (the first traffic light); County
E also intersects Route 23 about a mile north -- (800) 634-3444, (414) 892-2669
</p>
<p>
Also in Plymouth, the Crest Motel is on Route 57 about half a mile south of
Business Route 23, about seven miles from the track -- (414) 893-6111
</p>
<p>
In New Holstein, the Starlite Haus Motel is on Route 57 at the south edge of
town, about 12 miles northwest of the track.
Take County J northwest out of Elkhart Lake to Route 57, or Route 67 north to
Route 57, then northwest -- (414) 898-4216
</p>
<p>
Sheboygan Falls also has an AmericInn, near the Route 23 intersection with
US-32, about 13 miles southeast of the track -- (800) 634-3444, (414) 467-4314
</p>
<p>
In Kohler, the American Club is on County Y a mile or so southwest of the I-43
interchange with Route 23, about 14 miles southeast of the track.
This is an elegant, famous, and extremely expensive resort complex; the Indy
Car teams stay here (at least the drivers and owners do) -- (800) 344-2838,
(414) 457-8000
</p>
<p>
Southwest of Plymouth, the Silver Springs resort is on Route 67 at County S,
about 15 miles south of the track.
This facility offers four two-bedroom cabins and a locally famous
restaurant -- (414) 893-0969
</p>
<p>
In Sheboygan, just northeast of the Route 23 interchange with I-43, about
15 miles southeast of the track, are:
</p>
<ul>
