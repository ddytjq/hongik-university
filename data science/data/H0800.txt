The hippocampus (which means seahorse in Greek) resembles a zucchini and, in the human brain, is rolled up into medial side of the <A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~pietsch/callosum.html#86a">cerebrum's temporal lobe</A>.   A part of the <A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~pietsch/limbic.html">limbic system</A>, according to many authorities, the hippocampus has been implicated in certain short-term memory.  Indeed, hippocampal lesions often produce short-term memory deficits.   Although uncertainty attends the precise significance of hippocampal function, lesions in and around it in humans have produced some medically important and theoretically interesting findings.<BR>

AB: We encountered a case of focal encephalitis. A 5-year-old boy developed
high fever and he was admitted to our hospital on the third day with
generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. Cerebrospinal fluid showed slight
pleocytosis. CT showed diffuse low-density area in the left temporal, parietal
and occipital regions. T2 weighed MRI showed swelling and hyperintense regions
in the left temporal, parietal and occipital cortex. With the disappearance of
generalized convulsion, the cortical swelling improved. But aphasia and
intractable complex partial seizures appeared. On MRI, the atrophic findings of
the left hippocampus and temporal lesion became developed. We considered this
case corresponds to focal encephalitis related to "a peculiar type of
post-encephalitic/encephalopathic epilepsy" reported by Awaya et al.<p>

AB: A wealth of animal and human research has pointed to a significant
involvement of the temporal lobes in memory processing, and yet the different
functional roles of temporal cortical vs. mesial structures remain unclear. We
studied verbal declarative memory, by using a word list paradigm that
differentiates among learning (immediate recall), memory (delayed recall), and
recognition, in epilepsy patients being considered for surgical resection of
the left temporal lobe. Verbal memory was evaluated preoperatively and during
the recording of intracranial event related potentials and postoperatively
after selective hippocampectomy, temporal cortical lesionectomy, or anterior
two-thirds en bloc temporal lobe resection procedures. Preoperative differences
in verbal memory performance as a function of differences in underlying
neuropathology, concurrent event-related potentials, and <b>specific patterns
of postoperative memory impairments lead to converging evidence that verbal
declarative memory relies on a synergistic interaction of at least two
functionally distinct brain systems</b>. Material-specific data acquisition, or
working memory, is mediated by neocortical temporal structures, whereas
long-term consolidation/retrieval is particularly mediated by temporomesial
structures. In contrast to the left temporal neocortex, the function of the
temporomesial system appears to be material nonspecific. Apparently, its
preferential involvement in verbal memory is due to its close interaction with
overlying neocortical structures that are specialized for language
processing.<p>

AB: An important aspect of normal human memory, and one humans share with many
other species, is the ability to remember the location of objects in their
environment. There is by now strong evidence from the study of epileptic
patients undergoing brain surgery that right temporal-lobe lesions that
encroach extensively upon the hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus impair the
delayed, but not the immediate, recall of the location of objects within a
random array. These findings have now been extended to a multiple-trial,
spatial-array learning task; by including not only patients tested after
unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy but also those with a selective left or
right amygdalohippocampectomy, it has been shown that the deficits associated
with right hippocampal lesions are not dependent upon conjoint damage to the
lateral temporal neocortex. Furthermore, the fact that on the learning task no
group differences were seen on Trial 1, at zero delay, strengthened the view
that the impairment was in the maintenance and subsequent retrieval of
information rather than in its initial encoding. These results left unresolved
the question of whether the deficit was in the mediation of object-place
associations or whether it could be reduced to a more general impairment in
memory for location as such. Also left unanswered was the neuroanatomical
question as to the relative contributions of the hippocampus and the
parahippocampal gyrus to the performance of the experimental tasks. These
questions were addressed in two blood-flow activation studies that made use of
positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
incorporated computerized versions of object-location and simple-location
memory tasks. Taken together, the results point to a special contribution from
the anterior part of the right parahippocampal gyrus, probably corresponding to
the entorhinal cortex, to the retrieval of object-place associations, a result
consonant with neurophysiological findings in non-human primates.<p>

AB: This study was designed to determine whether hippocampal neuronal AMPA
(alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) and NMDA
(N-methyl-D-aspartate) mRNA levels were differentially increased in temporal
lobe epilepsy patients compared with those measured in control tissue from
non-seizure autopsies. Hippocampi from hippocampal sclerosis patients (n = 28)
and temporal mass lesion cases (n = 12) were compared with those from the
autopsies (n = 4), and studied for AMPA GluR1-3 and NMDAR1-2 mRNAs using
semi-quantitative in situ hybridization, along with fascia dentata and Ammon's
horn neuron densities. Compared with the autopsies, and without correction for
neuron counts, the mass lesion cases with neuron densities similar to autopsies
showed: (i) significantly increased NMDAR2 hybridization densities for fascia
dentata granule cells; (ii) increased AMPA GluR3 mRNA densities for Ammon's
horn pyramids; and (iii) similar or numerically increased mRNAs for all other
subunits and hippocampal subfields. Compared with the autopsies, hippocampal
sclerosis cases with decreased neuron densities showed: (i) significantly
decreased AMPA GluR1-2 and NMDAR1-2 hybridization densities for Ammon's horn
pyramids and (ii) similar or numerically decreased mRNAs for all other subunits
and subfields. However, correcting for changes in neuron densities showed that
hippocampal sclerosis patients had increased AMPA and NMDA mRNA levels per
neuron compared with autopsies, and in the CA2 resistant sector GluR2 mRNA
levels were numerically greater than autopsies and mass lesion cases.
Furthermore, relative to autopsies both sclerosis and mass lesion hippocampi
showed that, in the stratum granulosum, the greatest mRNA increases were in
AMPA GluR1 and NMDAR2 compared with the other mRNAs. In chronic temporal lobe
seizure patients these results indicate that mass lesion and sclerosis cases
show differential increases in hippocampal AMPA and NMDA mRNA levels per neuron
compared with autopsies, especially for AMPA GluR1 and NMDAR2 in fascia dentata
granule cells. These findings support the hypothesis that temporal lobe
seizures are associated with increased ionotropic glutamate receptor mRNA
levels and alterations in receptor subunit composition that probably contribute
to neuronal hyperexcitability, synchronization and seizure generation.<p>

AB: In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients without lesions, major hippocampal
sclerosis, or atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the localizing power
of [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) was compared
using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) studies and
individually coregistered MRI scans. Following complete clinical,
neuropsychological, and electrophysiological evaluation, benzodiazepine
receptor density was assessed using the FMZ equilibrium method. Thirty minutes
later, interictal FDG-PET was performed under resting conditions. PET images
were matched to three-dimensionally coregistered, T1-weighted MRI. Each
temporal lobe (TL) was divided into 12 volumes of interest. The regional FMZ
data were normalized with respect to average cortical values. For each patient
the right-left asymmetries of rCMRGlc and normalized FMZ data were calculated.
In 7 to 10 patients, mesial TL structures showed reduced FMZ binding, with a
decrease by at least 10% in the affected TL. Reductions of 10% or more of
rCMRGlc usually were more widespread than FMZ reductions and often involved
lateral temporal cortex. The regions of most pronounced disturbances are not
necessarily identical in both methods. Three patients had a complex
correspondence of lateralization with PET, neuropsychological, and EEG data. In
4 patients, lateralization was less clear from EEG or neuropsychological
results but was still consistent with lateralization by PET. In 3 of 10
patients, however, major discrepancies were found. These data suggest that the
combination of neuropsychological testing, EEG, and MRI-guided FMZ- and FDG-PET
will help to select patients with clearly defined epileptogenic foci especially
in mesial TLE. Even in cases without MRI lesions, TL epileptic foci can be
lateralized with consistency across the methods; FMZ-PET shows the pathologic
focus more circumscribed than FDG-PET.<p>

AB: Hippocampal dentate granule cells in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients
with mesial sclerosis (MTLE) are reported to be hyperexcitable compared to
those in patients with a mass lesion outside the hippocampus (MaTLE)
(Williamson, Clin Neurosci 1994;2: 47-52). To determine if such
hyperexcitability is associated with an altered morphology of these neurons,
Lucifer Yellow-filled granule cells from MTLE patients were compared with those
from MaTLE. The morphology of granule cells in both subject groups resembles
closely that of human granule cells described previously by Golgi studies.
About 40% of human granule cells have basal dendrites. Additionally their
apical dendrites are much more limited in their spread in the longitudinal axis
of the hippocampus contributing perhaps to a much more narrow lamellar
organization than in rats. Analysis of variance computed on 21 morphometric
parameters reveals a significant increase in the length of the portion of the
dendrite in the inner molecular layer (IML), and a decrease in length in the
outer third of the molecular layer in MTLE, compared to MaTLE. Factor analysis
performed on the morphometric features of each group of neurons reveals that in
the MaTLE neurons the most distinctive feature is the total dendritic length
and the overall distribution of spines on them, whereas in MTLE a lengthening
and elaboration of the dendrites in the IML is most distinctive. Previous
observations of increased synaptic terminals containing neuropeptides, and
neurotransmitter receptors in the IML taken in conjunction with an elaboration
of granule cell dendrites in this region, suggest considerable synaptic
reorganization within the IML of the MTLE hippocampus which may contribute to
its epileptogenicity.<p>

AB: The hippocampus serves as a funnel for heavily processed sensory
information that has converged at the entorhinal cortex. Lesions of the
hippocampus do not alter incoming sensory or motor information but, rather,
alter their integration with our baggage of emotional experiences and social
values. According to Bogerts, such a lesion would be ideally situated to result
in laboriously processed sensory information that is out of context to our
outside environment. In this regard, Bogerts describes the pathological
findings of a patient with a gross delusional disorder. The salient finding at
autopsy was a developmental lesion in the left posterior parahippocampal gyrus.
Although a number of lesions have been described in the brains of patients with
schizophrenia, Bogerts believes that those in the limbic system appear critical
to the expression of paranoid symptoms.<p>

AB: Modern views on brain concussion are reviewed by the authors who present
also the evolution of the views on this problem in the last five decades. Owing
to devising of an experimental model of light craniocerebral injuries the
presence of structural changes in the central nervous system developing after
concussion has been demonstrated. Using the modern diagnostic imaging
techniques (SPECT) in clinical practice persistent disturbances of regional
cerebral blood flow were found following such head injuries. The mechanism,
which could explain the development of cerebral perfusion changes, could
produce also axonal disorders, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, atrophy of
hippocampal neurons which lesions had been noted previously in experiments. The
results of SPECT investigations put in doubt the presence of a "pure"
functional brain damage following slight craniocerebral injury and provide
evidence for the existence will aim at correlating of electrophysiological
phenomena, vascular changes and biochemical disturbances with lesions leading
to disorders of behaviour observed in the so called postconcussion syndromes.<p>

AB: In approximately 30% of patients with intractable partial epilepsy, an
intra-axial cerebral lesion is the aetiology of the seizure disorder. Lesions
adjacent to mesiotemporal structures often result in secondary epileptogenicity
in the same region. The authors present 22 cases of low-grade gliomas
associated with intractable epilepsy. In 15 cases the location was temporal (8
extra-hippocampal and 7 with invasion of the amygdalo-hippocampus), 7 cases
were extratemporal in eloquent areas. The eight extra-hippocampal tumours were
originally treated with lesionectomy. The seizure outcome was class 1 in only 4
cases, the remaining 4 were class 4 according to Engel's classification. The 4
cases with class 4 outcome required additional temporal lobectomy associated
with amygdalo-hippocampectomy for seizure control. The 2 cases with associated
hippocampal atrophy at MRI after lobectomy had outcome class 1. The 2 cases
without hippocampal atrophy at MRI presented outcome class 2. The 7 cases with
invasion of amygdala and hippocampus were treated with selective
lesionectomy+amygdalo-hippocampectomy. In all these cases convergence of focal
structural abnormality, ictal onset of epileptiform EEG abnormality and
interictal epileptiform EEG abnormality provided powerful evidence of focal
epileptogenicity. All these patients had a favourable epilepsy outcome (class
1-2). In the seven extratemporal cases the first step was lesionectomy. In 1
case located in the parietal region intraoperative mapping was required. 5 had
class 1 outcome, one case had outcome class 2 and one case had an outcome class
4. The last patient required a second step operation with intraoperative strip
and deep electrode monitoring that led subsequently to a frontal lobectomy.
This patient is seizure free 2 years after surgery. There was no perioperative
mortality and post-operative morbidity was 3/22. This study indicates that
lesionectomy may be the first step procedure if the structural abnormality is
localized to extra-temporal eloquent cortex and concordance is documented.
Patients may subsequently be candidates for a cortical resection as a second
step procedure if the lesionectomy does not provide an adequate reduction in
seizure tendency. Since MRI identified hippocampal atrophy was predictive in
this study of an unsatisfactory seizure outcome after lesionectomy, MRI defined
dual pathologies consisting of a temporal lesion plus hippocampal atrophy
necessitate temporal lobectomy+amygdalo-hippocampectomy. In patients with
negative MRI findings of hippocampal atrophy and temporal lobe lesions,

AB: A series of 54 patients operated on for temporal epileptogenic lesions is
reported: 36 had slow growing tumours, 18 supratentorial cavernous angiomas.
The patients were divided into two different groups according to the presence
of seizures controlled (group 1) or not controlled (group 2) by antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs). All the patients underwent preoperative scalp EEG and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). They were operated on by pure lesionectomy, associated
with amygdalo-hippocampectomy in 8 cases of uncontrolled seizures.
Postoperatively they underwent MRI examination which revealed an incomplete
lesionectomy in 12 cases. Patients were followed up after surgery for at least
2 years, 6 of them were reoperated on for the persistence (or regrowth) of the
tumour. The results of epilepsy outcome are reported. These cases underline the
importance of preoperative electroclinical study, in order to determine the
relationship between lesion location and epileptic focus. If good concordance
is present, a complete lesionectomy is enough to cure the patient. In other
cases associated amygdalo-hippocampectomy leads to better results, while more
complicated cases may need preoperative stereo-EEG studies.<p>

AB: Amnesic patients with focal limbic lesions in the hippocampus demonstrate
normal or near normal performance on the Warrington Recognition Memory Test
(WRMT) suggesting that the hippocampi may not be critical structures in these
tasks. To further investigate the role of the hippocampi in recognition memory
we examined WRMT performance in 99 (44 right, 55 left) patients with unilateral
temporal lobe pathology identified on MRI. The patients were divided into two
groups. Group 1 (n = 90) were patients with hippocampal sclerosis (40 right, 50
left). Group 2 were patients with MRI evidence of hippocampal sclerosis and
cortical dysgenesis, (4 right, 5 left). Analyses of variance revealed a
significant interaction between laterality and pathology group for the
recognition memory for words (RMW) task. The patients with left hippocampal
sclerosis and cortical dysgenesis obtained significantly lower scores than the
other patient groups. There was a significant effect of pathology group on the
recognition memory for faces task (RMF). The patients with hippocampal
sclerosis and cortical dysgenesis obtained lower scores than the patients with
hippocampal sclerosis, regardless of the laterality of their pathology.
Post-operative WRMT deficits in the right and left hippocampal sclerosis groups
were material specific. The clinical utility of the WRMT in the pre-surgical
investigation of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and the role of the
hippocampus in recognition memory are discussed in the light of these
findings.<p>

AB: The history and development of the fanciful terminology concerning the
structures of the limbic system are discussed. The diseases involving the
limbic system are divided into three groups; (1) diseases in which the limbic
system is more or less selectively involved, such as limbic encephalitis,
herpes simplex encephalitis, cerebral confusions by the falx and tentorium, and
internal herniations through the falx and tentorium; (2) diseases in which the
limbic system is predominantly involved, such as arhinencephalia,
holoprosencephaly, cyst of cavum septi pellucidi, Pick's disease, Alzheimer's
disease, hippocampal sclerosis, and vascular diseases of the hippocampal
formation; and (3) diseases in which the limbic system is randomly involved,
such as various types of neoplasms and vascular and inflammatory lesions. The
relationship between destructive lesions of the hippocampus and memory also is
emphasized.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To establish if MRI evidence of hippocampal atrophy (HcA) is an
independent surrogate of EEG criteria for the diagnosis of medial temporal lobe
(MTL) epilepsy (MTLE). BACKGROUND: MRI evidence of HcA has been shown to
correlate with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), intracranial evidence of MTL
seizure onset, and outcome after temporal lobectomy. The reported rate of
discordance between scalp ictal EEG recordings and MRI evidence of unilateral
HcA ranges from rare to moderate. We examined the surface and depth ictal EEG
findings of patients with HcA, as detected by volumetric MRI, to clarify their
significance in detecting areas of epileptogenicity in this group of patients.
METHODS: From a group of patients with refractory epilepsy, we identified 119
patients with HcA (97 with unilateral and 13 with bilateral HcA, 9 with HcA and
mass lesion). MRI volumetric studies were used to obtain Hc ratios. Absolute
volumes were used to detect bilateral atrophy. Surface and depth EEG recordings
were analyzed for localization of ictal abnormalities, and their distribution
was compared for concordance with the location of HcA. Surgical outcome was
reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients with isolated HcA, 63 had surgery; 82%
of ictal depth EEG onsets were concordant with the atrophic Hc, and 72% ictal
surface EEG onsets were concordant. Four patients with concordant EEG and HcA
failed to achieve seizure control with resection of the atrophic Hc.
Furthermore, 3 patients with discordant EEG and HcA had resection of the
non-atrophic Hc with excellent results. Among the 47 non-operated patients, 54%
had discordant or unlocalized ictal depth EEG results and 52% had discordant
ictal surface EEG. Four of the 9 lesional patients with HcA had excellent
outcome after lesionectomy without hippocampectomy. CONCLUSION: The presence of
HcA is not an independent predictor of the site of epileptogenesis.<p>

AB: Although neuropsychological studies of the amnesic patient H. M. provide
compelling evidence that normal memory function depends on the medial temporal
lobe, the full extent of his surgical resection has not been elucidated. We
conducted magnetic resonance imaging studies to specify precisely the extent of
his bilateral resection and to document any other brain abnormalities. The MRI
studies indicated that the lesion was bilaterally symmetrical and included the
medial temporal polar cortex, most of the amygdaloid complex, most or all of
the entorhinal cortex, and approximately half of the rostrocaudal extent of the
intraventricular portion of the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus,
hippocampus, and subicular complex). The collateral sulcus was visible
throughout much of the temporal lobe, indicating that portions of the ventral
perirhinal cortex, located on the banks of the sulcus, were spared; the
parahippocampal cortex (areas TF and TH) was largely intact. The rostrocaudal
extent of the ablation was approximately 5.4 cm (left) and 5.1 cm (right). The
caudal 2 cm, approximately, of the hippocampus body (normal length,
approximately 4 cm) was intact, although atrophic. The temporal stem was
intact. Outside the temporal lobes, the cerebellum demonstrated marked atrophy,
and the mammillary nuclei were shrunken. The lateral temporal, frontal,
parietal, and occipital lobe cortices appeared normal for age 66 years. The
mediodorsal thalamic nuclei showed no obvious radiological changes. These
findings reinforce the view that lesions of the hippocampal formation and
adjacent cortical structures can produce global and enduring amnesia and can
exacerbate amnesia beyond that seen after more selective hippocampal lesions.<p>

AB: The purpose of our work was to compare the MR imaging findings of obvious
hippocampal and/or juxtahippocampal lesions with corresponding clinical
features. Magnetic resonance images of 63 patients with obvious lesions in the
hippocampal and/or juxtahippocampal regions were reviewed and their findings
were correlated with patients' clinical characteristics. Based on the MR and
clinical findings, the patients were divided into four groups: (a) 26 patients
with space occupying lesions or suspected vascular malformation frequently
causing symptomatic temporal epilepsy; (b) 14 with hippocampal infarcts, which
when left-sided or bilateral caused amnesia; (c) 11 with encephalitis and 5
with old temporal contusion usually accompanied by both amnesia and epilepsy;
and (d) 7 with temporal atrophy and progressive dementia of subacute onset.
Magnetic resonance imaging allows precise localization and evaluation of the
clinical correlates of hippocampal and juxtahippocampal lesions, which
frequently caused symptomatic temporal epilepsy and/or amnesic syndrome.<p>

AB: BACKGROUND: Surgical extirpation of medial temporal (AVMs) arteriovenous
malformations has been one of the most challenging issues in neurosurgery.
Yasargil classified mediobasal AVM into four subtypes: amygdala, anterior
hippocampal, middle hippocampal, and posterior hippocampal lesions. The lesions
around the trigone extending forward to the temporal horn, and medially
adjacent to the midbrain, can be referred to as posterior hippocampal AVMs. The
therapeutic indications and operative approaches for these lesions remain
controversial. METHODS: Nine patients underwent surgical resection for AVMs of
the posterior hippocampus using a laterobasal approach. RESULTS: In four
patients, AVMs were located chiefly within the lateral ventricle, and the
lesions were resected using a laterobasal approach through the occipitotemporal
sulcus, or through a hematoma cavity within the fusiform gyrus. Clinical
improvement followed the procedure in three of four patients. In the remaining
five patients, the nidi were located chiefly within the ambient cistern,
extending upward to the basal ganglia. Contralateral hemiparesis occurred in
three patients. Two patients showed marked improvement following an initial
decline in neurologic status. CONCLUSIONS: A laterobasal transventricular
approach is suitable for ventricular AVMs, whereas only limited exposure can be
afforded through a transventricular, transchoroidal fissure route for the AVMs
within the ambient cistern. For these lesions, a conventional subtemporal
approach to the tentorial incisura is preferable.<p>

AB: Modern neuroimaging can disclose epileptogenic lesions in many patients
with partial epilepsy and, at times, display the coexistence of hippocampal
atrophy in addition to an extrahippocampal lesion (dual pathology). We studied
the postoperative seizure outcome of 64 patients with lesional epilepsy (median
follow-up, 30 months) and considered separately the surgical results in the 51
patients with a single lesion and in the 13 who had dual pathology. In patients
with a single lesion, 85% were seizure free or significantly improved (Engel's
class I-II) when the lesion was totally removed compared with only 40% when
there was incomplete resection (p &lt; 0.007). All three patients with dual
pathology who had both the lesion and the atrophic hippocampus removed became
seizure free. In contrast, only 2 of the 10 patients with dual pathology
undergoing surgery aimed at the lesion or at the hippocampus alone became
seizure free (p &lt; 0.05), although 4 of them showed significant improvement
(Engel's class II). We conclude that the outcome in patients with single
epileptogenic lesions is usually dependent upon the completeness of lesion
resection. In patients with dual pathology, surgery should, if possible,
include resection of both the lesion and the atrophic hippocampus.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To examine the effects of memory stimulus type on Wada memory
performance. METHOD: Ninety-six patients (left, 47; right, 49) from four
epilepsy centers who were candidates for anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) and
who have subsequently undergone surgery were studied. Patients with atypical
cerebral language lateralization or with evidence on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to suggest a lesion other than hippocampal sclerosis were excluded. Wada
memory performance was obtained by using both real objects and line drawings as
memory stimuli. RESULTS: Wada memory laterality scores with either real objects
or line drawings as memory stimuli discriminated left from right-ATL groups.
However, objects were superior to line drawings in making this differentiation.
Further, objects were superior to line drawings in individual patient
classification of candidates for left ATL, with no difference in the
classification rates using either objects or line drawings in candidates for
right ATL. CONCLUSIONS: Type of memory stimuli is an important factor affecting
memory results during the Wada test.<p>

AB: The hippocampus has been proposed as the site of neural representation of
large-scale environmental space, based upon the identification of place cells
(neurons with receptive fields for current position in the environment) within
the rat hippocampus and the demonstration that hippocampal lesions impair place
learning in the rat. The inability to identify place cells within the monkey
hippocampus and the observation that unilateral hippocampal lesions do not
selectively impair topographic behavior in humans suggest that alternate
regions may subserve this function in man. To examine the contribution of the
hippocampus and adjacent medial-temporal lobe structures to topographic
learning in the human, a 'virtual' maze was used as a task environment during
functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. During the learning and recall
of topographic information, medial-temporal activity was confined to the para-
hippocampal gyri. This activity accords well with the lesion site known to
produce topographical disorientation in humans. Activity was also observed in
cortical areas known to project to the parahippocampus and previously proposed
to contribute to a network subserving spatially guided behavior.<p>

AB: Neuropathological study on the limbic lesion of 33 autopsy cases with
senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) showed as follows. 1) The entorhinal
cortex was more atrophied than the hippocampus. 2) Neuronal loss was found in
the 2nd and 3rd layers of the entorhinal cortex, irrespective of the different
numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). 3) Fibrillary
gliosis occurred in the stratum lacunosum of the hippocampus, irrespective of
the different degrees of neuronal loss in the stratum pyramidale of the
hippocampus. 4) The prosubiculum showed gliosis disproportional to neuronal
loss. 5) The degree of fibrillary gliosis in the stratum lacunosum of the
hippocampus and in the prosubiculum was proportional to that of the entorhinal
cortical degeneration. 6) The shape of the hippocampus of the cases with SDAT
was different from that in the cases with anoxic encephalopathy in which
neuronal loss in the CA1 occurred primarily: 7) Distribution pattern of the
lesion in the hippocampus of SDAT cases was almost the same as that found in
the cases with infarct in the collateral sulcus involving the entorhinal
cortex. It is assumed that the hippocampal atrophy is a primary degeneration
attributable to appearance of senile plaques and NFTs. However, our present
observations and previous report (Neurosci Lett 184: 141-144 1995) suggest that
degeneration of the entorhinal cortex and its efferent fibres (perforant
pathway) plays a considerable part of role in development of the hippocampal
atrophy. The present study could contribute to understanding of progression of
the limbic lesion in SDAT.<p>

AB: Neuropsychologic assessment has long been an integral part of evaluation
for surgical treatment of epilepsy. Neuropsychologic evaluation and
consultation continue to be an important part of the assessment for operative
intervention for epilepsy, but the role of neuropsychology has changed over
time. At one time, neuropsychologic assessment assumed a diagnostic role in
preoperative evaluation for epilepsy and also contributed to the lateralization
and localization of the seizure focus. Sophisticated electroencephalographic
techniques and especially neuroimaging have revolutionized the diagnosis and
management in epilepsy surgical treatment centers. Although still helpful,
neuropsychology no longer has a major role in lateralization or localization of
seizure onset. This report describes neuropsychologic evaluation and its
current role in surgical treatment of epilepsy. The characteristics and
purposes of neuropsychologic assessment and Wada testing (intracarotid
injection of amobarbital) are described. Current research on assessment of
emotional adjustment and on its predictors before and after surgical therapy
for epilepsy is reviewed. Finally, the risk for neuropsychologic decline after
temporal lobectomy is discussed in light of recent research on preoperative
memory, hippocampal pathologic lesions, and quantitative neuroimaging data.<p>

AB: The long-term neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae of herpes simplex
virus encephalitis (HSVE) and their relationship to the volume of temporal
lesions and to amygdala and hippocampus damage remain undefined. We have
conducted a prospective study of long-term sequelae in 11 patients with
clinically presumed HSVE and detection of HSV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid by
polymerase chain reaction. Six months after encephalitis, patients underwent
neuropsychological and language assessment. At the same stage, single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) evaluated the occurrence of hypoperfusion
with an index of asymmetry. MRI was used for the measurement of amygdala,
hippocampus and cerebral lesions by two blind neurologists. The volume of the
amygdala and hippocampus was compared with those of five controls, matched for
age and level of education. Long-term memory disorders were seen in 6 patients,
associated with the larger lesions and damage of at least two structures.
Long-term behavioural changes with emotionalism, irritability, anxiety or
depression were prominent in 7. Left prefrontal hypoperfusion appeared in 8
patients, associated with psychiatric disorders in 7 and left amygdala damage
in 6. The reduction of amygdala and hippocampus volume was correlated with the
overall volume of lesions. Different patterns of mesial temporal lobe damage
occurred, involving either amygdala alone, or amygdala and hippocampus, but
never hippocampus alone. MRI volumetric measurements in HSVE could be a good
indicator of long-term prognosis. Persistant behavioural changes could be
related to an amygdala and frontal dysfunction.<p>

AB: The present study compared the recognition memory deficit in different
groups of amnesics using scores from a standard test. The data, taken from a
literature search, came from 33 studies reporting the performance of amnesic
subjects on the recognition memory test (RMT) [77]. A total of 112 amnesic
subjects were grouped according to their pathology. In addition, the analysis
included subjects with schizophrenia, amygdala damage, or frontal lobe damage.
Of these three nonamnesic groups, only the frontal lobe subjects were impaired
on both RMT subtests, while the schizophrenics showed a disproportionate
impairment for the recognition of faces. The amygdala subjects were also poor
at face recognition. Among the amnesic groups, those subjects likely to have
multiple sites of pathology (e.g. Korsakoff amnesics, post-encephalitics) were
found to be the most impaired on the RMT. In contrast, those amnesics with more
focal, limbic lesions in the hippocampus, fornix, or mamillary body region
showed much milder deficits on the RMT task, some performing at normal levels.
Despite their apparent sparing of recognition, the overall severity of amnesia
in those subjects with limbic lesions appeared comparable to that in the
remaining amnesics. These findings indicate that deficits on both subtests of
the RMT are a frequent but not inevitable component of anterograde amnesia.
They also point to a distinct subgroup of amnesias associated with selective
damage in the hippocampus or its diencephalic targets, in which there is a
relative sparing of recognition under certain test conditions.<p>

AB: We evaluated regional cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus in 21 patients
with neurological disorders by 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) SPECT and
compared the findings with those by 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP)
SPECT. In all subjects, SPECT was taken using ECD (740 MBq) and IMP (167 MBq)
using high performance SPECT (3-head SPECT, Toshiba GCA-9300A/HG) within 3
weeks interval. Regional uptake in the hippocampus was examined in the coronal
sections and images parallel to the longitudinal axis of hippocampus. ECD and
IMP showed similar hippocampal uptake in 9 cases, but ECD showed less uptake
than IMP in 12 cases (57%). Regional counts in the hippocampus were related to
the counts in the lateral temporal cortices and the mean count ratio was lower
in ECD by 8.8% than that in IMP (0.73 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.80 +/- 0.11, p &lt;
0.001). In 6 patients suspected to have hippocampal lesion (4 cases of memory
disturbance and 2 cases of epilepsy), all cases showed decreased uptake of ECD
in hippocampus, but only 3 cases showed decreased uptake of IMP. This is
suggestive to be relevant to the difference in the retention mechanism of ECD
and IMP, but further investigation should be performed.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of the fast FLAIR sequence in
patients with epilepsy. METHODS: One hundred and twenty eight patients with
epilepsy and 10 control subjects were scanned with the fast FLAIR sequence with
5 mm slices, a coronal gradient echo (GRE) T1 weighted sequence with 1.5 mm
slices and spin echo (SE) or fast spin echo (FSE) proton density and T2
weighted sequences with 5 mm slices. All images were compared by an unblinded
neuroradiologist and neurologist. Fast FLAIR images of patients with
hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and normal control subjects were also evaluated by
two blinded independent raters. RESULTS: Fast FLAIR provided a high conspicuity
of neocortical damage, hamartomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours,
and clear cut hippocampal sclerosis. However, the same information could be
obtained from the coronal T1 and T2 weighted images. In three patients fast
FLAIR showed a clearly abnormal signal when SE T2 weighted images had not been
definitely abnormal. Heterotopia was less conspicuous on fast FLAIR than GRE T1
weighted images. The two blinded raters detected all but one of the patients
with clear cut hippocampal sclerosis on fast FLAIR images but missed all
borderline cases of hippocampal atrophy and there were two false positives.
Clear cut hippocampal sclerosis was more conspicuous on fast FLAIR images than
on SE T2 weighted images in most patients, but additional patients were not
identified. CONCLUSION: Fast FLAIR has the advantage of identifying neocortical
lesions and definite hippocampal sclerosis with a short scanning time and may
also demonstrate lesions when other sequences are normal in a limited number of
cases. The technique was not useful, however, for identifying mild hippocampal
sclerosis or heterotopia.<p>

AB: The ability to respond to unexpected stimuli (the 'orienting response') is
a fundamental characteristic of mammalian behaviour, but the brain mechanisms
by which novelty is detected remain poorly defined. Electrophysiological
recordings of scalp and intracranial event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown
that novel stimuli activate a distributed network involving prefrontal and
posterior association cortex. In addition, ERP and single-neuron recordings, as
well as neuroimaging and modelling studies, have suggested that temporal
cortical regions, including the hippocampus, are also involved. To examine
further the role of the medial temporal lobe in novelty processing, I measured
physiological responses to novel auditory and tactile stimuli in patients with
damage to the posterior hippocampal region. In normal control subjects,
unexpected novel stimuli produce a characteristic ERP signal, accompanied by an
autonomic skin response. Both responses are reduced in hippocampal lesion
patients, whereas the response to expected control stimuli is unaffected. Thus
the hippocampal region, in addition to its known role in memory formation, is
an essential component of the distributed limbic-cortical network that detects
and responds to novel stimuli.<p>

AB: In this study, we determined whether childhood seizures were associated
with hippocampal neuron loss and mossy fibre synaptic reorganization and if
hippocampal sclerosis evolved from longer seizure histories. Children
undergoing surgical treatment for catastrophic epilepsy were grouped into the
following pathology categories: (i) those with generalized seizures and
extra-hippocampal congenital pathologies (i.e. prenatal cortical dysplasia; n =
17); (ii) cases of generalized seizures and extra-hippocampal acquired lesions.
(i.e. postnatal ischaemic injuries and encephalitis; n = 7); (iii) children
with complex partial hippocampal epilepsy (n = 4). Further, to determine
whether the epileptogenic location influenced hippocampal pathology, the
seizure focus was classified as (i) hippocampal, (ii) temporal (n = 13) or
(iii) extra-temporal (n = 11). Surgical and autopsy (n = 23) hippocampi were
studied for (i) fascia-dentata (FD) and Ammon's horn (AH) neuron densities;
(ii) thickness; height or length of the FD molecular layer, stratum granulosum
(SG) and stratum pyramidale; and (iii) grey value (GV) densities of
supragranular neo-Timm's staining. Statistically significant results (P &lt;
0.05) showed the following. (i) Autopsy hippocampal neuron densities for the
hilus (H), AH and prosubiculum (Pro) decreased logarithmically at the same time
as the thickness of the stratum pyramidale and Pro increased. By contrast,
autopsy granule cell densities and thickness did not significantly change with
age; however, the SG lengthened-expanding around the enlarging H. Further, the
supragranular molecular layer height increased logarithmically, and took longer
than the increase in stratum pyramidale thickness. (ii) Compared with
age-matched autopsies, young children with a history of hippocampal seizures
showed decreased granule cell, hilar and regio superior neuron densities
similar to adults with hippocampal sclerosis (average loss 70%). By contrast,
children with extra-hippocampal congenital or acquired pathologies showed only
decreased granule cell densities, along with a thinner and shorter SG. Compared
with extra-temporal locations, those with temporal lobe lesions showed
decreased hilar and AH neuron densities, but averaged 20-30% less than
autopsies and not in the pattern typical of hippocampal sclerosis. (iii) The
neo-Timm's GV densities, when compared with autopsies, showed supragranular
mossy fibre sprouting in children with congenital pathologies and temporal lobe
lesions; however, the greatest GVs were in children with hippocampal seizures.
(iv) Of the children with extra-hippocampal congenital or acquired pathologies
there were no statistical correlations between longer duration of seizures with
changes in neuron densities, hippocampal heights, or mossy fibre sprouting.
These results indicate the following. (i) In the human there is anatomical
evidence for postnatal maturation of the hippocampus and our results are
consistent with the notion that AH pyramids are a stable population; however,
there are probably increases in granule cell numbers. Further, compared with
the AH, dendritic maturation of the FD granule cells appears to take longer.
(ii) Extra-hippocampal childhood seizures whether from prenatal or postnatal
aetiologies are associated with moderate FD and minimal AH neuron losses and
signs of aberrant mossy fibre sprouting. (iii) By contrast, young children with
the syndrome of mesial temporal epilepsy show patterns of neuron loss and mossy
fibre sprouting, typical of hippocampal sclerosis. (iv) Repeated
extra-hippocampal childhood seizures are not associated with progressive
evolution of hippocampal damage or mossy fibre sprouting. These findings
support the hypothesis that childhood seizures can damage or alter the
postnatally developing granule cells of the human hippocampus, and that early
neuron loss and aberrant axon circuits may contribute to chronic hippocampal
seizures. However, repeated childhood generalized seiz<p>

AB: We recently demonstrated statistically significant correlations between
presurgical memory impairment and hippocampal volumetric cell densities (in CA3
and the hilar area only) for patients with idiopathic left temporal lobe
epilepsy who exhibited marked hippocampal neuron loss. In the present research
we determine whether the same relationship exists for patients with structural
lesions, in whom hippocampal neuron loss was minimal. Rank-order correlations
of verbal memory test results (ie, Long Term Retrieval score of the verbal
Selective Reminding Test, Percent Retention index of the Logical Memory subtest
of the Wechsler Memory Scale) and hippocampal volumetric cell densities
(subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, the hilar area, and the granule layer of area
dentata) were computed for 22 patients with structural lesions and medically
refractory epilepsy of temporal lobe onset (11 left, 11 right). There were
statistically significant correlations between Long Term Retrieval and the
volumetric cell density of CA1 (r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05) and between percent
retention and the volumetric cell density of CA2 (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.05) for
patients with left hemisphere lesions. No other correlations were found for

AB: Dementia is a common problem in elderly patients and may influence the
indication for invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures under
consideration for other diseases more than age itself. This short paper reviews
the role of tomographic imaging techniques--whose possibilities have expanded
in recent years--in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Computerized
tomography (CT) of the brain is used primarily to detect such potentially
treatable conditions as multiple ischemic infarctions, hematomas, hydrocephalus
and brain tumors. It should be performed even in old age, unless the patient's
general state of health is too poor to expect good results from therapeutic
measures. Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive in ischemic white matter
lesions and hippocampal atrophy, and should therefore be used preferentially in
mildly affected patients. Functional imaging methods, such as SPECT and PET,
are needed only to demonstrate impairment of cortical blood flow and metabolism
in clinically unclear cases.<p>

intracranial ictal EEG onsets, and hippocampal neuron losses were compared.
Patients (n = 63) were classified into: (1) Tumors (n = 26, e.g. astrocytomas,
gangliogliomas); (2) vascular (n = 9, e.g. cavernous and venous angiomas); (3)
developmental (n = 17, e.g. cortical dysplasia, heterotopias); or (4) atrophic
(n = 11, e.g. cortical or white matter encephalomalacia). Other variables were;
(1) the location of the temporal lesion in the mesial to lateral, and anterior
to posterior plane, (2) a clinical history of an initial precipitating injury
(IPI) prior to the onset of TLE (e.g. prolonged first seizure, head trauma),
(3) hippocampal neuron densities, (4) focal or regional location by
intracranial depth EEG of ictal onsets, and (5) seizure outcomes. Results
showed that severe hippocampal neuron losses were associated with two
statistically significant findings. First, patients with mesial lesions in or
adjacent to the body of the hippocampus had greater neuron losses compared to
mesial lesions anterior or posterior to the hippocampus (P = 0.04). Second,
lesion patients with an IPI history had greater Ammon's horn (AH) neuron losses
compared to those without IPI histories (P = 0.0005), and the profile of loss
was similar to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Granule cell losses correlated in a
complex manner in that; 1) by regression analysis densities decreased with
longer intervals of TLE (P = 0.006), (2) tumor patients with IPIs had less
granule cell loss compared to those without IPIs intervals of TLE (P = 0.006),
(2) tumor patients with IPIs had less granule cell loss compared to those
without IPIs (P = 0.05), and (3) developmental patients with IPIs had greater
granule cell loss than patients without IPIs (P = 0.009). Mesial-temporal depth
EEG electrodes were the first areas of ictal activity in 15 of 16 patients
(94%), and greater hippocampal neuron losses were not associated with focal
mesial-temporal EEG onsets. Seizure outcomes were worse in tumor patients
compared to HS patients (P = 0.01), and patients with post-resection seizures
had incomplete resections of their lesions and/or hippocampi. These results
indicate that in TLE lesion patients the amount and pattern of hippocampal
neuron loss depends on the location of the lesion, the pathologic
classification, and a history of an IPI. Further, despite variable neuron
losses, in temporal lesion patients the hippocampus was nearly always involved
in the genesis or propagation of the chronic seizures.<p>

AB: The distribution of the VIP receptor in the human hippocampus was studied
by receptor autoradiography using [3-iodotyrosyl-125I]Vasoactive Intestinal
Peptide (VIP) as a ligand, and the relationship of receptor distribution to the
distribution of the peptide (visualized by immunocytochemistry) was examined in
hippocampi surgically removed from patients with medically intractable temporal
lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampi obtained at autopsy from neurologically
normal subjects. In the autopsy hippocampi and hippocampi from TLE patients
with extrahippocampal temporal lobe lesions [125I]VIP binding was highest in
the dentate molecular layer, with lower levels in the fields of Ammon's Horn
(CA fields) and the subiculum. In hippocampi from patients with no temporal
lobe lesions but considerable hippocampal neuronal loss there were significant
elevations in the levels of ligand binding in all CA fields and the subiculum.
Ligand binding densities in all CA fields of the patient hippocampi were
strongly negatively correlated with neuronal numbers. Immunocytochemical
localization of VIP shows no obvious change in the distribution patters of VIP
immunoreactivity in the patient groups. This is the first demonstration of VIP
and its receptor distribution in the human hippocampus. It is suggested that
the elevated levels of receptor binding in the hippocampal seizure focus may
indicate a mechanism for greater excitability of neurons and/or for their
survivability in the face of the increased excitation and potential for injury
in a seizure focus.<p>

AB: The present experiment was designed to investigate the incidence of
temporal and extra-temporal epileptogenic lesions on hippocampal activity
related to recognition memory. Hippocampal event-related potentials (ERPs) were
recorded during a recognition memory task for pictures in patients with
unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy and in patients with combined temporal and
extra-temporal (frontal or parietal) epileptogenic foci. In the first group,
the comparison between correctly recognized pictures and new distractors
revealed that the usual ERP (N400/P600) 'old/new' effects were not dramatically
affected by the presence of a temporal epileptogenic lesion. In contrast, these
effects were absent in multifocal epilepsy patients, indicating that frontal
and parietal brain regions play a part in the modulation of hippocampal ERP and
related memory processing. These results suggest that ERP 'old/new' effects are
dependent on interactions between frontal, parietal and medial temporal
structures. Together with the results of other recent studies devoted to
locating the neural sources of N400 and P600, the present findings provide
physiopathological evidence that ERP 'old/new' effects are subtended by
distributed yet interconnected brain regions that are known to play an
important role in recognition memory processing.<p>

AB: In this study we investigated event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in
response to somatosensory stimuli in two patients with bilateral hippocampal
lesions caused by herpes simplex encephalitis. The patients had severe amnesia,
but retained immediate memory, so that they could perform the odd-ball task
according to experimental design with the instructions repeated at every
session. The ERPs recorded from both patients were similar. In an odd-ball
paradigm, early cognitive components, P100 and N140 were elicited to
infrequent-target stimuli, but no P300 components were noted. Preservation of
selective attention for target stimuli leading to decision was demonstrated by
correct responses throughout the examinations. In one patient a clear P300 was
visible after she recovered from her memory disturbance 8 months after its
onset. These findings suggest that the hippocampus plays an important role in
generating the P300, even if the primary generators are present elsewhere in
the brain. On the other hand, our findings support the notion that the P300 is
a post-decisional component, and has little relevance to decision-making in a
series of information processing steps.<p>

AB: We used actuarial methods to study outcome after temporal lobectomy in 135
consecutive patients classified into subgroups according to preoperative MRI
findings. Sixty months after surgery, 69% of patients with foreign tissue
lesions, 50% with hippocampal sclerosis, and 21% with normal MRIs had no
postoperative seizures. An eventual seizure-free state of 2 years or more,
whether the patient was seizure-free since surgery or not, was achieved by 80%
of patients with foreign tissue lesions, 62% of those with hippocampal
sclerosis, and 36% of those with normal MRIs. Outcome was worse in those with
normal MRIs than in the other two groups. Early postoperative seizures with
later remission (the "running down" phenomenon) occurred in all groups. Late
seizure recurrence was present only in the hippocampal sclerosis group. These
data show that preoperative MRI is a useful predictor of outcome and that
actuarial analysis provides insight into different longitudinal patterns of
outcome in MRI subgroups. This information can now be used in preoperative
counseling.<p>

AB: In the Western world previous studies have shown that the majority of cases
of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), which is caused by thiamine
deficiency, occur in alcoholics. However, in France, a country with one of the
highest per capita consumptions of alcohol, the prevalence of the WKS was found
to be only 0.4% in a small retrospective autopsy study. This figure is compared
with data sent to the authors by a number of neuropathologists from the U.S.A.,
Europe, Scandinavia and Australia. There was no obvious correlation between the
prevalence rates of the WKS, which were highest in Australia (2.8%-previously
published), and per capita consumption of alcohol. Other issues such as diet,
National programs for supplementation of foods with thiamine, and drinking
habits are considered. The pathological diagnosis of the WKS can often be made
on macroscopic examination of the brain after fixation in formalin. The
mammillary bodies are smaller than normal in most cases of chronic WKS. However
in this study it was found that the most common causes of small mammillary
bodies were Alzheimer's disease and atrophy due to transneuronal degeneration
secondary to lesions in the hippocampus.<p>

AB: The role of brain computerized tomography (CT) imaging in predicting
clinical outcome was investigated in patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen
therapy for serious carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. From a series of 48
consecutive patients suffering loss of consciousness from CO exposures, the
records of 40 selected patients were evaluated to determine how their CT
findings correlated with clinical outcome. A neuroradiologist blinded to
patient outcome confirmed the radiographic findings. CT abnormalities consisted
of globus pallidus hypodensities (nine patients), subcortical white matter
hypodensities (four), cerebral cortical lesions (one), cerebral edema (one),
hippocampal lesions (one), and complete loss of gray-white differentiation
(one). Of the patients with globus pallidus lesions, 44% manifested incomplete
recovery, whereas white matter lesions reflected a 74% incidence of morbidity.
Age, duration of CO exposure, and interval between CO exposure and treatment
did not significantly relate to clinical outcome. The blood carboxyhemoglobin
levels correlated with clinical prognosis (P &lt; 0.05) and, importantly, CT
results significantly predicted clinical outcome (P &lt; 0.05). A normal scan
correlated highly with a complete recovery, whereas an abnormal scan predicted
incomplete recovery or death, despite prior HBO therapy. The current study
establishes prognostic validity for brain CT imaging for evaluating clinical
outcome after HBO therapy for CO poisoning.<p>

AB: Quantified hippocampal mossy fiber synaptic reorganization and neuron
losses were measured to determine the pathological features associated with
epileptogenic fascia dentata. Twenty-five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) were classified as having either mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS; 16
patients), with seizure genesis in the hippocampus, or temporal mass lesions
(nine patients), with seizures that were probably extrahippocampal. Neo-Timm's
histochemistry identified mossy fiber sprouting, and aberrant fascia dentata
puncta densities were objectively measured by light microscopic analysis on an
image-analysis computer. neuron densities determined cell losses and the two
seizure groups were compared to control specimens obtained from autopsies.
Results showed significantly greater fascia dentata mossy fiber puncta
densities and neuron losses in TLE patients compared to autopsy specimens (p
&lt; 0.026). Furthermore, there were significant differences between the two
seizure groups: 1) mossy fiber puncta densities in the inner molecular layer
were significantly greater in MTS compared to lesions (p &lt; 0.02), and 2)
mossy fiber puncta densities were greater in the inner molecular layer than in
the stratum granulosum in 14 of 16 MTS patients (88%) compared to four of nine
patients with lesions (44%, p &lt; 0.01). Neuron densities were significantly
different comparing MTS, lesion and control groups for stratum granulosum (p =
0.0001) and Ammon's horn (p = 0.0001), with each group significantly different
(p &lt; 0.05) compared to another. All patients were either seizure-free or
significantly improved 1 year or more after en bloc temporal lobectomy. There
were no significant correlations between fascia dentata mossy fiber puncta
densities and counts of hilar neurons, CA4 pyramids, granule cells, or years of
seizures. This indicates that inner molecular layer mossy fiber puncta
densities and neuron losses are greater in patients with MTS than in those with
lesions, and mossy fiber sprouting probably contributes to the pathophysiology
of hippocampal seizures. Furthermore, these data show that some patients with
extrahippocampal lesions have mossy fiber sprouting similar to MTS patients,
suggesting that hippocampi in lesion patients may be capable of epileptogenesis
from synaptic reorganization.<p>

AB: Initially described as modulatory molecules in the peripheral immune system
and during haematopoiesis, several cytokines also play a role in the brain.
Their synthesis in the central nervous system (CNS) is not due solely to glial
cell activation or invading immune cells. On the one hand, several functions of
central neurons are modulated by cytokines such as IL-1, TNF alpha, IL-2 and
IL-6. Thus, IL-1 and TNF alpha modulate the synthesis of several neuromediators
and modify ion influxes. IL-2 regulates the effects of central dopaminergic
neurons on cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and glutamatergic
functions. On the other hand, neurons have recently been shown to be able to
synthesize some of these cytokines under specific traumatic conditions. For
example, a lesion to the hippocampus induces neuronal synthesis of IL-1 alpha
and TNF alpha. This induction through neuronal circuits may operate at a
distance in contrast to the glial reaction operating only locally. The recent
demonstration of the expression by central neurons of receptors specific for
these cytokines support a potentially crucial role for these molecules in brain
function. Some data emerge in the literature demonstrating a potent expression
of cytokines in the central nervous system in numerous pathological situations.
Then, it appears that, at the interface between nervous and immune systems,
cytokines may bear a pivotal role in the development of specific symptoms in
neuroimmune diseases.<p>

AB: The study aimed at testing: (1) whether stereotaxic damage to the
hippocampus and amygdala results in a memory deficit, (2) whether the memory
functions subserved by the hippocampus are lateralized and (3) whether time
limited storage of sensory information is impaired after focal hippocampal and
amygdalar lesions. Seven patients with unilateral stereotaxic damage to the
anterior part of hippocampus and unilateral or bilateral damage to the medial
part of amygdala and 11 control subjects with no brain damage participated in
the research. They were presented with memory tests that required either
remembering a spatial arrangement of simultaneously presented verbal vs
nonverbal stimuli or a temporal order of sequentially presented items.
Moreover, a sensory information storage test was used. The results indicate
that even small damage limited to the anterior part of the hippocampus and
medial part of the amygdala results in a mild memory deficit. Memory impairment
was not related to the side of hippocampal lesion. This suggests that memory
function subserved by the hippocampus is not lateralized. Differential effects
of left and right lobectomies found in previous studies were, thus, probably
due to the damage to temporal cortex. The results showed, however, that sensory
information storage limited to 3 s is not impaired after focal damage to the
hippocampus and amygdala. A clear lateralization effect showing right
hemisphere advantage in that function was found.<p>

cerebral perfusion secondary to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). However, in

hippocampal lesions have been observed in the absence of high ICP. To further
elucidate the role of raised ICP in the production of posttraumatic hippocampal
neuronal damage, 14 cases of fatal human nonmissile head injury, in which the
measured ICP was less than 20 mm Hg, were subjected to light microscopic
evaluation for the frequency and anatomic distribution of hippocampal damage.
The mean maximal ICP of the 14 patients was 17.6 mm Hg. Detailed light
microscopic evaluation revealed hippocampal lesions in 12 of the 14 cases
studied (86%). These lesions were typically bilateral foci of selective
neuronal loss in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. The nature and
distribution of hippocampal lesions were similar to those previously reported
both in fatal human head injury associated with elevated ICP and in
experimental acceleration head injury without raised ICP. These results provide
further evidence that the occurrence of hippocampal neuronal loss following
head injury is not exclusively dependent on elevated ICP. Other mechanisms,
such as pathologic excitation of neurons, may be involved.<p>

AB: Long-term electrocorticograms (ECoG), recorded by chronically implanted
subdural electrodes during preoperative evaluation of 59 patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy (TLE) were analyzed retrospectively to assess the prognostic
relevance of distribution of interictal epileptiform potentials (IEP) and
seizure origin (SO) and to investigate factors affecting their lateralization.
Subsequent to preoperative evaluation, a standardized two thirds anterotemporal
lobectomy including subtotal hippocampectomy had been performed in all
patients. The following results were obtained: (a) Only patients with 100%
lateralization of SO and IEP had excellent seizure outcome (= 89%
seizure-free); (b) patients with bitemporal SO were unlikely to benefit from
surgical treatment (= 12.5% seizure-free); (c) 40-56% patients with unilateral
temporal SO and bitemporal IEP, became seizure-free irrespective of the degree
of lateralization of IEP; and (d) multidimensional analysis of variance showed
that lateralization of SO, presence of a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)-detectable lesion, presence of hippocampal sclerosis, presence of febrile
seizures and seizures at age &lt; or = 6 years are the five most important
variables indicating abolition of seizures. Combined analysis of ECoG-recorded
SO and IEP allows prediction of postoperative seizure control within close
boundaries.<p>

AB: The objective of the present study was to review the alterations of the
central nervous system (CNS) in a group of deceased Mexican patients with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; autopsies were reviewed with a special
emphasis on the damage to the hippocampal formation. Of these 19 deceased
patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, nine (47%) had opportunistic
infections in the CNS that were accompanied by human immunodeficiency virus
encephalitis (HIVE), three (16%) had evidence of opportunistic infections in
the brain without HIVE, and two (11%) had HIVE alone. All of the patients who
had presented with neurological and neurobehavioral alterations had evidence of
HIVE and/or opportunistic infections in the CNS. Of these 19 patients, 11 (58%)
had presented with evidence of HIVE (with or without opportunistic CNS
infections), as evidenced by the presence of gp41-positive microglial cells in
the basal ganglia, neocortex, and hippocampus. The subiculum was the region
that displayed the most abundant infiltration by gp41-positive microglial
cells. The percentage of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with HIVE
and/or CNS opportunistic infections in our series was similar when compared
with that of other series in which similar methods of detection of human
immunodeficiency virus in the CNS were used. We conclude that evidence of human
immunodeficiency virus-associated lesions in the hippocampal formation might in
part explain the selective neuronal alterations in this limbic structure, and
we suggest that damage to this circuitry might be in part involved in the
cognitive alterations in HIVE.<p>

AB: Ten cases of PSP were examined for the presence of neocortical and
hippocampal lesions. Samples from 10 cortical areas were stained by Bodian's
method and by tau, ubiquitin and beta A4 immunocytochemistry. For the sake of
comparison, 5 Alzheimer's cases were studied with the same techniques.
Neocortical tangles, star-like tufts of fibers, and neuropil threads were seen
in all the cases of PSP. They were stained by Bodian's technique and labelled
by an anti-tau, but not by a polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody. Senile plaques
(Bodian's technique), diffuse or focal amyloid deposits (beta-A4
immunohistochemistry) were rare or absent. The density of tangles was the
highest in area 4 and the lowest in area 17. In area 4, the tangles were mainly
located in layers V-VI. By contrast, the Alzheimer's tangles had a bimodal
distribution (layers III and V-VI). These results favor the specificity of
cortical alterations in PSP.<p>

AB: Ubiquitin-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites in the CA2/3 region of the
hippocampus are characteristic of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). The origin
of dystrophic CA2/3 neurites is unknown, but their extent correlates with the
number of cortical Lewy bodies (LBs). To examine the molecular composition of
these lesions, hippocampal sections were obtained at postmortem from cases of
DLBD, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The tissue samples were
fixed in a variety of fixatives and immunostained with antibodies to ubiquitin,
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (PGP9.5), neurofilament protein subunits, tau
protein, paired helical filaments and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In addition to
being ubiquitin positive, both cortical LBs and CA2/3 dystrophic neurites were
positive with a neurofilament monoclonal antibody (RM032) and PGP9.5; however,
fewer lesions were detected with these antibodies compared to ubiquitin
immunocytochemistry. The dystrophic CA2/3 neurites were not stained with
antibodies to tau proteins, paired helical filaments or TH. Absence of TH
immunoreactivity suggests that CA2/3 neuritic processes are not derived from
brain stem dopaminergic afferents to the hippocampus. Since CA2/3 neurites are
immunologically similar to cortical LB, the pathogenesis of these lesions may
be similar. Characterization of dystrophic CA2/3 neurites and cortical LBs may
clarify how these lesions contribute to the emergence of dementia in DLBD.<p>

AB: FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) images are MR images obtained
with an inversion recovery sequence having a long inversion time (TI) and a
long echo time (TE). Twenty healthy adults and twenty patients with multiple
cerebral infarction, multiple sclerosis, temporal epilepsy, or brain trauma
were examined with FLAIR sequences of several types having repetitive times
(TR) of 4000-8000 msec, inversion times of 1200-2400 msec and echo times (TE)
of 140-200 msec, and the results were compared with spin-echo sequences (TE =
20 msec and TE = 90 msec). With a long repetitive time of 6000 msec and a long
inversion time of 1400-1600 msec, the cerebrospinal fluid signals in the
lateral ventricles and the cerebral sulci were low-intensity with brain tissue
appearing as high signal intensity areas with good T2 contrast. The FLAIR image
signal intensities correlated well with T2 relaxation times under 100 msec.
Cystic lesions with long T2 relaxation times over 100 msec in multiple
sclerosis and cerebral infarction appeared as low-signal areas, and the lesions
surrounding the cystic lesions as high-signal areas. In patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy, the hippocampus was visualized as a high-signal area.
Hippocampal lesions were demonstrated better with FLAIR images than with
conventional T2-weighted images or proton-density images. In a cerebral
contusion patient, the FLAIR images revealed a lobulated structure with the
residual cortex appearing as high-signal areas. The lesions surrounding the
cystic change were imaged as high-signal areas. These structural changes were
demonstrated better with FLAIR images than with conventional T2-weighted
sequences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

AB: This 21-year-old male with hemophilia A developed cytomegalovirus (CMV)
retinitis associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). He had a
history of numerous blood transfusions. Serum antibody titers became positive
for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), when the patient was 18 years of age.
Three years later, he developed CMV retinitis due to his immunosuppression.
Ganciclovir (DENOSINE, TANABE SEIYAKU CO., LTD., Osaka, Japan) therapy given
for 4 weeks produced a marked improvement in the ocular fundal findings, but
the neurologic signs and symptoms, including headache, hypoesthesia,
disorientation, and dementia became worse. T2-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) demonstrated a diffuse high intensity area in the periventricular
white matter and small focal or patchy lesions in the hippocampus, basal
ganglia, midbrain, medulla oblongata and the nucleus dentatus. The patient died
of HIV encephalopathy and CMV infection. Characteristic CMV intranuclear
inclusion bodies were observed histologically in most sites of the brain
including the hippocampus, white matter, basal ganglia, midbrain, medulla
oblongata, nucleus dentatus and the retina. Infiltration by monocyte-macrophage
and multinucleated giant cells, which are characteristic of HIV encephalopathy,
were observed in the periventricular white matter and the hippocampus. In this
patient, the neuroimaging findings were compatible with the neuropathologic
observations. MR imaging proved useful in detecting the central nervous system
(CNS) lesions of AIDS and CMV infection.<p>

AB: To test the hypothesis that memory disorders of subcortico-frontal dementia
result mainly from inefficiency of retrieval processes of stored information,
we compared verbal learning in 15 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy,
prototypical of "subcortical dementia," in free (California Verbal Learning
Test) and controlled (Grober and Buschke's Test) encoding situations, with that
of 19 controls, matched for age and level of education. The progressive
supranuclear palsy patients showed memory deficits characterized by impaired
immediate memory span, disturbed learning and consistency of recall, and
abnormal number of false alarms at recognition, which were dramatically
alleviated by controlled encoding associated with cued recall, using the same
semantic cues. This memory profile was markedly different from that of patients
with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (n = 15), characterized by more
rapid forgetting and less improvement in the controlled situation. Instead, it
was similar to the memory pattern of patients with Parkinson's (n = 15) and
Huntington's (n = 15) diseases. These results show a similar profile of memory
disturbance in disorders involving damage to the striatofrontal system and
suggest that the cortical and hippocampal lesions of PSP patients are
insufficiently severe to interfere with the specific memory profile
characteristic of the disease.<p>

AB: Invasive versus non-invasive epileptogenic zone definition was analyzed in
a series of 89 patients operated on for drug-resistant epilepsy. In the group
of 69 cortical resections, 26% needed invasive recordings, 13.5% when
foreign-tissue lesions had been detected by MRI and 32% when were absent. In
this last group temporal resections had invasive EEG recordings in 23.5% versus
54.5% when the epileptogenic zone was extratemporal. In a group of 43 temporal
resections with more than one year follow-up MRI has detected some abnormality
in 84%. Excluding focal lesions, MRI detected hippocampal/temporal lobe atrophy
in 66% of the cases in agreement with other noninvasive tests and in 4%
contralateral to the epileptogenic zone located by subdural strips. The outcome
analysis showed that 85% of the patients with MRI-EEG agreement were seizure
free in contrast to only 43% when MRI was non-lateralizing. Future studies has
to be oriented to better understand the epileptic process of patients without
MRI abnormalities.<p>

AB: We retrospectively examined the MR imaging (MRI) findings in 144 patients
with epilepsy (31 with temporal lobe epilepsy and 113 with other epilepsies).
110 cases (76.4%) showed abnormal findings such as spotty lesions in white
matter, hippocampal atrophy and/or signal change, ventricular dilatation and/or
deformity, developmental lesions, brain tumors and so on. Hippocampal atrophy
and/or signal change was shown in 74.1% of temporal lobe epilepsy, a remarkably
high percentage (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the other types of epilepsies
(18.1%). This finding means that hippocampal lesions may play a large part in
the cause of temporal lobe epilepsy. Investigation of the relationship between
clinical term and abnormal findings revealed that the longer the clinical term,
the larger the number of hippocampal lesions, regardless of whether it is
temporal lobe epilepsy or not. Thus hippocampal lesions may occur as a result
of hypoxia accompanied with seizure. Therefore we recommend horizontal and/or
vertical sections of hippocampus in MR imaging of all patients with epilepsy.
Even though MR findings may reflect some secondary lesions, MRI will shed some
light on the proper understanding of epilepsy.<p>

AB: P3(00) event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded using auditory
and visual stimuli from 5 amnesic patients with confirmed (n = 4) or suspected
(n = 1) bilateral damage to the hippocampal formation without skull defects.
Four normal control subjects were matched to each amnesic patient with respect
to age, sex, education, and IQ subtest scores (n = 20 total controls). All 5
amnesic patients exhibited ERPs, and no reliable differences in P3 amplitude or
latency could be detected between the patients and the control subjects in
either modality. The findings indicate that the hippocampal formation does not
contribute significantly to the scalp-recorded P3 from auditory and visual
target stimuli, a conclusion also supported by additional recent findings from
studies of patients with extensive bilateral medial temporal lobe damage
studies. The significance of the P3 component for cognitive processing is
discussed.<p>

AB: The processes by which humans and other primates learn to recognize objects
have been the subject of many models. Processes such as learning,
categorization, attention, memory search, expectation and novelty detection
work together at different stages to realize object recognition. In this
article, Gail Carpenter and Stephen Grossberg describe one such class of model
(Adaptive Resonance Theory, ART) and discuss how its structure and function
might relate to known neurological learning and memory processes, such as how
infero-temporal cortex can recognize both specialized and abstract information,
and how medial temporal amnesia might be caused by lesions in the hippocampal
formation. This model also suggests how hippocampal and inferotemporal
processing might be linked during recognition learning.<p>

AB: The human amnestic syndrome associated with lesions of the hippocampus and
amygdala is characterized by a selective impairment of recent (explicit,
episodic) memory. Benzodiazepine (BZ) treated normal subjects demonstrate
similar, marked impairments in episodic memory, but in addition, BZ also
induces sedation and inattention. Thus, the amnestic effects of BZ may be
secondary to drug-induced sedation. However, when subjects were pretreated with
the specific BZ receptor antagonist, flumazenil, the sedative and attentional
effects of diazepam were blocked, but a marked impairment in episodic memory
still occurred. This demonstrates that, using neuropharmacological methods, it
is possible to produce a dissociation of memory impairment from inattention and
sedation. Such distinct patterns of cognitive dysfunction may serve as models
for clinical cognitive syndromes.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE. Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common lesion associated with
temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobectomy is effective for the control of
medically refractory seizures in these patients. Before the advent of MR
imaging, hippocampal sclerosis was rarely diagnosed preoperatively. The purpose
of this study was to determine the frequency of hippocampal sclerosis in
children with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy and the accuracy and
reliability with which hippocampal sclerosis can be diagnosed on the basis of
MR findings in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the MR images of 53
children (mean age, 10 years) with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.
The MR images were reviewed blindly and independently by two radiologists on
two occasions, and were classified as showing hippocampal sclerosis, other
lesions, or no abnormality. Hippocampal sclerosis was diagnosed when evidence
of hippocampal atrophy was present or hippocampal signal intensity was abnormal
without evidence of a mass lesion. RESULTS. MR images showed hippocampal
sclerosis in 30 children (57%), other lesions in 10 (19%) (tumors in eight,
cavernous angioma in one, and ectopic gray matter in one), and no abnormality
in 13 (24%) (intraobserver agreement: kappa = 0.77 and 0.84, interobserver
agreement: kappa = 0.76). MR lateralization was concordant with ictal EEG in 36
(92%) of 39 children. Hippocampal sclerosis was bilateral in one child and
associated with extrahippocampal lesions in nine. Hippocampal sclerosis was
detected on MR images of 11 (85%) of 13 children with pathologic confirmation
of hippocampal sclerosis. Beneficial results were seen in 26 (90%) of 29
children who had temporal lobectomy. CONCLUSION. Hippocampal sclerosis is the
most common lesion in children with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, and it
can be detected reliably and accurately on MR images. We suspect that
hippocampal sclerosis is underdiagnosed in children, possibly leading to
postponement of surgery in children with refractory seizures.<p>

AB: A pathological examination on the hippocampus of brain was carried out on 5
cases of endemic cretinism. Computer image analysis was focused on the
pyramidal and granular cells. There was a wide distribution of hypoplasia, and
changes of the parameters involved in the pyramidal and granular cells were
remarkable, which indicated that a development disorder existed in the
hippocampus. Besides, a correlation was noticed between the weights of the
thyroid gland and the brain as well as the parameters of the hippocampus. It is
also noticed that changes of the thyroid gland correlated with the change in
the CNS. Since lesions in the hippocampus were known to be closely related to
dementia, it is considered that lesions found in the hippocampus constitute one
of the morphologic bases of dementia in endemic cretinism.<p>

AB: The syndromes associated with dementia and depression in old age show a
considerable overlap and even coincidence, not only for statistical reasons.
Starting with a critical evaluation of the term "pseudodementia", possibilities
for a differentiation of both types of syndromes by characteristics of clinical
features and history and by additional investigations are shown. A critical
review of the literature with focus on the differentiating properties of the
following methods is given: neuropsychology and rating scales (e.g., "cortical"
mediated versus motivational changes), neurophysiology (electroencephalography,
EEG; evoked potentials, EP; event-related potentials, ERP), sleep physiology
(REM-sleep changes; sleep deprivation results), neuroendocrinology
(dexamethasone suppression test), neuroradiology (cranial computed tomography,
CCT; magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and especially the dynamic imaging
methods of nuclear medicine (cerebral glucose metabolism with
fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography, FDG-PET; cerebral blood
flow (CBF) measurements with PET and single photon emission tomography, SPET).
Developments during recent years concerning better imaging of early hippocampal
lesions (MRI) or analysis of CBF--changes induced by activation methods may be
very helpful. In conclusion, one can say that the diagnosis of dementia and
depression remains primarily a clinical one that can be ascertained by means of
valuable diagnostic tools.<p>

AB: The hippocampus is known to be frequently involved in head injury. In
adults, such hippocampal lesions frequently include regions of selective
neuronal necrosis. The present report examines the frequency and distribution
of hippocampal damage in 37 cases of fatal head injury in children. Damage to
the hippocampus was noted in 27 of 37 cases (73%). Lesions were often focal
areas of selective neuronal necrosis located in the CA-1 subfield. Other
subfields of the hippocampus were involved to lesser degrees. The frequency and
distribution of hippocampal damage in fatal childhood head injury is similar to
that reported for fatal head injuries of all ages. Pathological evidence of
high intracranial pressure and/or hypoxic brain damage in other anatomical
locations was present in the majority of cases. Clinical seizures prior to
death occurred in 22% of the cases studied. However, these factors could not
account for all cases of hippocampal damage in the present report. Thus, the
hippocampus is frequently damaged in fatal head injury in children. The
mechanisms involved in the production of such damage may involve hypoxia,
raised intracranial pressure and altered cerebral perfusion. However, other,
yet to be elucidated, mechanisms may be involved.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE--Comparing the pattern of spared and impaired memory functions in
neurodegenerative diseases known to affect different brain structures.
DESIGN--Various situations of acquisition (free encoding or controlled
encoding) and retrieval (immediate and delayed free and cued recall,
recognition) were used. SETTING--Referral center. PATIENTS--Fifteen for each
disease (ie, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type [SDAT], Parkinson's and
Huntington's), matched for education, severity of dementia, and depression.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Comparison of free and controlled encoding situations,
relationships between memory, executive, and linguistic functions test scores.
RESULTS--In the free encoding situation: no difference among the three groups,
but higher numbers of intrusions and false recognitions in SDAT. In the
controlled situation: cued recall and recognition scores significantly higher
in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease than in SDAT. Memory
performances correlated with executive functions test scores in Huntington's
disease and Parkinson's disease, but not in SDAT. All results significant at P
&lt; .01. CONCLUSIONS--Clear distinction between the true amnesic syndrome of
SDAT, compatible with lesions of hippocampus and temporal cortex, and the
inefficient planning of memory processes of Huntington's disease and
Parkinson's disease, which might result from a striatofrontal dysfunction.<p>

AB: The predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was assessed by a
prospective study of 34 patients selected for surgical treatment of temporal
lobe epilepsy. The MRIs were interpreted using standardized visual diagnostic
criteria and the imaging findings were correlated with the surgical outcome.
Lateralized MRI abnormalities were found in 25 (74%) of 34 patients.
Significant associations were found between either the presence of a restricted
foreign-tissue lesion or hippocampal atrophy and an excellent surgical outcome.
An abnormal MRI had an 82% predictive value and a normal MRI had a 56%
predictive value for surgical success. A history of febrile convulsions and the
presence of hippocampal atrophy best predicted outcome (predictive value, 86%).
These results suggest that specific MRI findings in candidates for temporal
lobe epilepsy surgery are predictive of surgical outcome. The information
provided by MRI may be of value for counseling patients prior to surgical
intervention.<p>

AB: Verbal recent memory disturbance was observed in a patient with a malignant
glioma associated with left hippocampal atrophy. A 25 year-old male was
admitted because of seizures. CT scan and MRI showed enhanced mass lesions in
the left temporal lobe associated with ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy.
Neurological examination disclosed right homonymous hemianopsia, word amnesia,
alexia, agraphia and acalculia. Neuropsychological examination disclosed verbal
recent memory disturbance, which consisted of impaired recall of the precisely
memorized words after some interruption. Although hippocampal lesions are known
to be often associated with cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal atrophy due to
brain tumor is quite unusual. This case suggested that the left hippocampus is
closely related to verbal recent memory. Hippocampal atrophy in this case
conceivably derived from the decreased arterial flow due to perifocal edema or
obstructive hydrocephalus.<p>

AB: Patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergo
medial temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy for one of two reasons. (1) A
lesion (tumor or arteriovenous malformation) adjacent to, but not invasive of,
the hippocampus, results in the removal of the lesion and adjacent hippocampus
in order to ensure a tumor-free margin. This group will be referred to as
tumor-related TLE (TTLE) patients. (2) The operation is performed when depth
electrode recordings and other evaluative techniques point to the hippocampus
as the focus of seizure initiation. This group will be referred to as
cryptogenic TLE (CTLE) patients. Analysis of the hippocampi of these two groups
of patients reveals that the TTLE hippocampus is quite similar to that of
autopsy subjects in its chemical neuroanatomy. However, the dentate gyrus of
the CTLE patients shows considerable morphological and cytochemical
reorganization. This reorganization is characterized by a number of features.
(1) There is a loss of granule cells which occurs either as a patchy loss
and/or a thinning of the granule cell layer. (2) Remaining granule cells which
contain dynorphin appear to produce recurrent collaterals into the inner
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. (3) In the subgranular region of the
hilus (the polymorphic layer) there is a selective loss of interneurons
immunoreactive for somatostatin, neuropeptide Y and substance P. (4) There
appears to be an increase in fibers immunoreactive for somatostatin and
neuropeptide Y which extend throughout the dentate molecular layer.
Somatostatin fibers being less numerous than neuropeptide Y fibers (5). The
distributions of a number of neurotransmitter receptors also show striking
reorganization in the dentate gyrus of the CTLE hippocampus. (6) Second
messenger systems protein kinase C and adenylate cyclase, and Na+, K(+)-ATPase
activity, as determined by ouabain binding, is increased in the molecular layer
of CTLE. This remodeling of the CTLE hippocampus may hold the key to the
mechanisms of hyperexcitability of the granule cells in the hippocampus of this
group, and consequently the generation of seizures. The removal of the
hippocampus in CTLE patients results in good control of seizures, whereas
removal of hippocampi that do not show such reorganization, in a group of
patients classified as atypical CTLE patients, results in inadequate seizure
control. These findings suggest a complex series of processes in converting the
properly regulated granule cells into hyperexcitable ones.<p>

AB: A 78-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of acute onset
amnesia in March 1991. Neurological examination revealed right homonymous
hemianopsia and clumsiness of the right hand. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
demonstrated abnormal intensity areas in the left hippocampus, parahippocampal
gyrus, fimbria of the hippocampus and the occipital lobe. Immediate memory and
long-term memory were relatively well-preserved, but short-term memory was
severely disturbed. Her memory disturbance persisted for more than 9 months and
she eventually developed an "amnesic stroke". According to the MRI findings,
the "amnesic stroke" was produced by infarction of the left hippocampus,
parahippocampal gyrus and fimbria of the hippocampus. We emphasized that in
this case an "amnesic stroke" was caused by infarction of the left hippocampal
lesions.<p>

AB: In vitro electrophysiologic studies of animal hippocampal slice models of
epilepsy have generated hypotheses regarding cellular pathophysiologies
associated with epileptogenesis. We tested some of these hypotheses using in
vitro intracellular recordings of hippocampal neurons from patients with
intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. We compared the electrophysiology of
hippocampal neurons from 14 patients with mesiotemporal sclerosis with
hippocampal neurons from 7 epileptic patients with structural lesions near the
hippocampal biopsy. Both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked synaptic function and
action potential firing patterns were observed. Presumed pyramidal neurons from
sclerotic hippocampus were significantly less likely to display stimulus-evoked
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and were more likely to fire
spontaneously in bursts of action potentials than were hippocampal neurons from
patients with structural lesions. No significant differences were detected in
spontaneous postsynaptic potentials, spontaneous rhythmic synaptic events,
spontaneous or anode break action potentials, stimulus-evoked excitatory
postsynaptic potentials, or stimulus-evoked action potential bursts. Cellular
membrane parameters were similar in the two groups, including resting membrane
potential, action potential amplitude, action potential half-width, action
potential threshold, input resistance, time constant, input/output
relationship, and afterhyperpolarization amplitude.<p>

AB: The authors reviewed 149 patients who underwent standard anterior temporal
lobectomies for intractable complex partial epilepsy with a mean follow-up
period of 5 years. Quantitative analyses of hippocampal neuron loss showed that
all patients had some cell loss compared to control hippocampi obtained at
autopsy. The average hippocampal cell loss was categorized as severe (greater
than 30% of autopsy control levels) or mild. Analysis of hippocampal and
extrahippocampal pathologies showed that in 109 cases (73%, the hippocampal
lesion group) hippocampal cell loss was mild in 17 cases (16%) and severe in 92
cases (84%); in the remaining 40 cases (27%, the extrahippocampal structural
lesion group) hippocampal cell loss was mild in 24 cases (60%) and severe in 16
(40%). The first index of surgical outcome was worthwhile seizure reduction,
which occurred in 94 cases (86%) with mild or severe hippocampal lesions and in
33 cases (82%) with extrahippocampal pathology. In the hippocampal lesion
group, worthwhile seizure reduction occurred in 90% of cases with severe and in
only 65% of cases with mild hippocampal cell loss (p = 0.015). In the
extrahippocampal pathology group, worthwhile seizure was not statistically
different, whether hippocampal cell loss was severe (94% of cases) or mild (75%
of cases). The second index of surgical outcome was the occurrence of residual
seizures in the patients with worthwhile seizure reduction, which would
indicate remaining epileptogenic tissue. In the hippocampal lesion group, the
incidence of residual seizures was not statistically different whether
hippocampal cell loss was severe (24% of cases) or mild (45% of cases).
However, in the extrahippocampal pathology group, residual seizures occurred in
53% of cases with severe cell loss (dual pathology) but in only 11% of cases
with mild cell loss (p = 0.025). Worthwhile seizure reduction can be predicted
by the presence of either severe hippocampal cell loss or an extrahippocampal
structural lesion. However, residual seizures more frequently follow in cases
with a combination of both (extrahippocampal pathology associated with severe
hippocampal cell loss, or dual pathology), suggesting that epileptogenic tissue
more likely extends outside the boundaries of a standard temporal lobectomy.<p>

AB: The hippocampus has sometimes been proposed to function as a cognitive map,
a memory system that stores information about allocentric space. Work with
experimental animals and memory-impaired patients has raised difficulties with
this view by showing that the hippocampus is not performing an exclusively
spatial function. However, the possibility has remained that the hippocampus
plays a special role in spatial memory or a disproportionately large role in
spatial memory compared to other kinds of memory. This study compared spatial
and nonspatial memory in amnesic patients with lesions of the hippocampal
formation or diencephalon. Subjects studied an array of 16 toy objects and were
subsequently tested for object recall, object recognition, and memory for the
location of the objects. Control subjects were tested after long retention
intervals in order to equate their object memory performance with that of the
patients. The main finding was that, when the performance of amnesic patients
on the object memory tests was matched to the object memory performance of
control subjects, spatial memory performance of the amnesic patients also
matched the spatial memory performance of the control subjects. The results
were the same for the two groups of patients. These findings suggest that the
hippocampus is not especially involved in spatial memory. Spatial memory is
simply one instance of a broader category of memory that requires the
hippocampus. While cognitive mapping in its most abstract sense may describe
hippocampal function, our results support alternative formulation, suggesting
that the hippocampus is necessary for the rapid acquisition of relational,
configural, or declarative (as opposed to purely spatial) information.<p>

AB: The interpretation of conditional discrimination and reversal learning as
acquisition of declarative knowledge suggests that subjects with temporal
lobe/hippocampal lesions are likely to be impaired on such tasks. Patients with
unilateral left or right temporal lobectomy (and small hippocampal excisions)
and patients with unilateral frontal lobe resections were compared with healthy
controls on a discrimination reversal task, embedded in a computer game
modelled on T-maze tasks traditionally used in animal experiments. The right
temporal group showed a deficit in acquiring an initial conditional
discrimination, and the frontal group tended to display a marginal impairment
in discrimination reversal. These findings are compared with results from
animal studies in terms of the mechanisms underlying reversal learning.<p>

AB: Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both
fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3
others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal
controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed
matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning.
The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to
hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix
damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this
discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix
transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man.<p>

AB: We compared hippocampal lesions in three pedigrees of Familial Alzheimer's
Disease (FAD). In these pedigrees, the disease is inherited as an autosomal
dominant disorder and has been linked to DNA markers on chromosome 21. In eight
cases of FAD (four from one pedigree and two each from two others) we
quantified neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques (SP) in hippocampal
subdivision CA1-4, subiculum, presubiculum, and dentate gyrus. We observed
consistent patterns of the distribution of lesions: The highest density of NFT
and SP was present in CA1-2; virtually no SP or NFT were present in
presubiculum; SP diameter was consistently greatest in CA4. We found no overall
differences among pedigrees in total densities of NFT and SP, but statistical
analyses disclosed that an uncommon type of SP was disproportionately present
in two pedigrees. This type of SP was usually restricted to CA4, had a marked
amyloid core devoid of argyrophilic neurites. These studies also disclosed
inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity of lesion distribution (including
congophilic angiopathy and cerebellar plaques) in these three pedigrees.<p>
