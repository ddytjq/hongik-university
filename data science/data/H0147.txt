The upcoming movie
"<a href =

has some footage of left handed DNA on Mars.

2000 April 10:
Steve Ward
(sward@UMDNJ.EDU)
saw the movie and points out that
"Every example they used was left handed - both the M&Ms and
the computer generated model."
At one point one person says "That DNA looks human." when viewing
a left handed spiral no more than 10 bases long.  DUMB!!!!
<font color = red>
WARNING, SPOILER</font>:
Actually,
the Martians seeded earth with right handed DNA, then left
because Mars was dying.  This is consistant
with them coming back now to take over.  They must have messed up
somehow when they seeded Earth!
Or maybe it was a nifty trick to identify and eliminate native
flora?

Dear Webmaster:
May I have permission to put the left handed image of DNA at
     http://www.genengnews.com/news1.htm
that is,
     http://www.genengnews.com/images/dnastrand-angle2-trans.gif
on my Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame page?
     http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
Currently it is item 16.
Please note that your image is the mirror image of DNA found in biological
systems on earth.
Thank you!

| Lynn:
| 
| Thanks for responding.
| 
| There are two points:
| 
| 1.  I find it very frustrating to go to a web site and be forced to fill out
| a web form.  I use vi or vim under unix and it is *much* faster and flexible
| for editing than a web page.  So it would be useful to provide an email
| address in addition to the web form.
| 
| 2.  I maintain a web page and would like to maintain a copy one of your
| items.  This is the request:
| 
| May I have permission to put the left handed image of DNA at
| 
|      http://www.beckmancoulter.com/nucleicacid/
| 
| that is,
| 
|      http://www.beckmancoulter.com/nucleicacid/images/nucleicacidad.jpg

| Please note that your image is the mirror image of DNA found in biological

|

| 
| I noticed that on your web site you changed the image from a jpg to a gif,
| but it is still reversed.  The new version has motion while the image I
| captured was fixed.  Since it takes a while for my page to load I would
| retain the non-moving version, since people probably wouldn't get to see the
| movement (it only shows once).  (If I were to put a moving version, I'd make
| it repeat, but that's too much work.  Also, the web page above still points
| to the fixed version.)
| 
| Thank you!

Surprisingly both species have the same number of chromosomes.

| 
| Dear Editors:
| 
| Without a doubt, these are exciting times in the field of biology and your
| informative articles on the human genome truly illustrate this point.  I
| could not help but notice, however, the reversed images of the helical DNA
| molecules represented on pages 54 and 60 (July 2000).  DNA is sometimes
| inadvertently printed as a "left-handed" spiral when it actually occurs as a
| "right-handed" molecule (see "The Left-Handed DNA Hall of Fame" by Dr. Thomas
| Schneider, www.fred.net/tds/dna) and this seems to be the case here.  I do
| hope that you will alert and remind your readers of this not-so-trivial
| aspect of DNA structure.
| 
| Thank you for your excellent reporting of science issues.

| Most sincerely yours,

that the resulting left handed proteins (translated by left handed

<a href = "http://www.spiegel.de/">
Der Spiegel</a>
(15/2000, page 172)
published an article "MENSCHEN NACH MASS"
literally "HUMANS AFTER MEASURE", I suppose
meaning the "Measure of Man" - left handed DNA man that is,
since behind the da Vinci but young modern human
is a left handed DNA.
<img src="icons/new.gif" alt = "new"> as of 2000 July 23
Nigel E. A. Crompton, nigel.crompton@psi.ch points out:
<blockquote>
Your
literal translation is of course correct but the actual meaning is not
"measure of man". The phrase "nach Mass" means "as you choose to have or
design something". Perhaps a more appropriate way to translate the
phrase would be "Artificial contructrion of Man".

| Dear Dr. Schneider,
| 
| Thank you for pointing out our Left Handed DNA catalogue cover. I was also

| Although we do have a sense of humour and would find it quite amusing to

| 
| Thank you and Happy Holidays.

| 
| This is an unusual situation, so I have created an unusual (my favorite!)
| color for the explanation, and I have noted this in the text.  I hope
| that this is acceptable.
| 
| I'm curious how much you paid for the image and whether there is a clause in

<font size = 3 color = blue>
The cover is OK, at least (in contrast to Griffith's 7th edition, which you
caught already). Inside, all the thick-ribbon illustrations, too, are
right-handed throughout. The simple line drawings, however, if they
actually show a twist, are left-handed at an amazing frequency.
<hr>
p2:fig.P.1, p.144:chpt.5-vignette; p.159:fig.5.15; p.160:fig.5.16;
p.162:fig.5.17-a; p.168:fig.5.20(some); p.189:fig.B(some); p.242:fig.B;
p.469:fig.13.7; p.477:fig.13.14; p.572:fig.16.13+16.14; p.592:fig.17.2;
p.597:fig.17.12-a; p.609:fig.17.23-a; p.648:fig.18.13-a-b.

Fig.5.20-c, in particular, gives 6 "examples" for pairs of sister
chromatids containing containing DNA molecules of either handedness.

Maggie Fox of Reuters
reported
on October 12
that the left handed DNA mouse
genome was almost mapped.
For this great 'nearly' event (we can have as many of
these as we want!),
MSNBC put together a cute moving graphic to demonstrate
how DNA sequencing is "almost" done.
They called it
<a href = "http://www.msnbc.com/news/475861.asp"
>MappingDNA</a>.
Unfortunately you will need Flash on your computer to see it.

| Dear Dr. Schneider
| 
| Interesting point. True, the DNA strand itself is not the logo -- it's a
| piece of clipart the designer flipped left right, without realizing the
| consequences, or differences between dextral and sinistral spirals. I'm
| actually kind of surprised it took about a month for somebody to catch it
| (our second "catch" occured late last week as well by another eagle eyed
| member). Also, sorry I'd not thought to check it myself. SIGH.
| 
| If you run it as just the strand, that's ok for now. I say "for now," just
| in case somebody else gets their knickers in a twist and asks me to rescind
| the permission, ok?

Steve Ward reports:
<font size = 3 color = blue>
I just returned from Cell Biology where I saw two left handed DNAs at
booths of companies and both of them knew it.  One was apologetic and promised
to change it, so I promised her I would not report it.  The other company knew
it, and even had a three dimensional space filling model of left handed B-DNA
that was intentional!  The problem was that the logo was originally a short,
left handed helix that looked vaguely like DNA, so to have the transformation
from the logo to the 3D model, the 3D model had to be reversed!  Their website
(<a href = "http://www.biosearchtech.com/">http://www.biosearchtech.com/</a>)
does not have the 3D model, but the left handed logo is there.
