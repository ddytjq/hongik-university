If you have someone who is financially reliant upon you
what would they do if you were to die?</B><BR><BR>
Regular bills and expenses would still need to be paid. If you have
a mortgage or other loans these repayments would
still need to be met.<BR><BR>
Life cover can help you provide for your loved ones by giving them a
cash lump sum or regular income should the
unforeseen occur. Outstanding debts can be repaid
and financial worries can be removed. You can
tailor the cover to meet your budget and also
choose cover for as long as you need it. A
savings element can also be built into the plan.</font></p>

An income replacement plan can provide you with
an income when you need it most. The benefits are
not taxable (the law relating to taxation is
liable to change and cannot be foreseen) and will
continue until you are able to return to work.

What if you contract a serious illness and are unable to

not pay out until death and nowadays more and
more people recover from critical conditions and
continue with their lives. Policies can provide a
lump sum to enable you to cope with a changing
lifestyle or even to repay your mortgage for
example.</font></p>

regular amount which you want to put aside or a
lump sum which you want to make more of there are
many options open to you. You might be concerned
about inflation reducing the value of your
savings? Depending upon what sort of return and
