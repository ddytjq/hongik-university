<b>
Despite not even playing football properly until the age of eleven Joe has earned huge acclaim for his silky skills. From an early age he has been watched by some of the biggest clubs in England, he has even been given Manchester United shirts in an attempt to coax him to their club. However he decided to stay loyal to the first club that tried to take him in West Ham. Since then he has been in the papers countless times since the age of fifteen and had received more media hype by the age of eighteen than most players will get in their careers. He certainly has the right background to go on to be the best. He followed in the footsteps of people of the popularity of Michael Owen by going to the school of excellence at Lilleshall at the age of 14. making the leap from someone just starting out in team football to one of England's stars of the future in the space of three years. He even earned a days training with the England team before he played his first game! And even more surprisingly he was more nervous about having lunch and playing golf with the England team than playing stating about the day, "The training was alright," "When you're playing football you don't think about who you're passing the ball to, you just play naturally."<br>
Joe Cole is seen by many people as the future of English football. He has been tipped to become a future England international, and has been called the next Gazza. However this was before he'd even touched a ball, and now with his skills in full show people are going on about him even more. Far from being the flash in the pan that some people expected he has so far gone from strength to strength, with his most promising game so far being his second Under-21 international in which he totally controlled the match for the 74 minutes he was in it. He's also been recognised at a younger age by the national team as well, appearing in the Under-15's side. He continued to force an impression to make it through to the Under 18's and now the days seem numbered before Keegan has no choice but to put him in the full squad.<p>
1998-1999<br>
After already putting in an appearance at the England training camp Joe Cole finally made his way into the top flight in the January of 1999. Still only at the tender age of 17 many would have expected him to have been slightly nervous about his introduction, he was being instantly expected to look brilliant and a class above the rest. Fortunately he seems wise for one so young and has generally been able to take most of the attention given to him in his stride. Harry gave him a substitutes appearance in the FA Cup against their third division rivals Swansea City. But it was no walk in the park for the youngster as he settled quickly into the game to help the side claim a draw after entering the game a goal behind. But if a match against Swansea City wasn't seen as the most luxurious of places for such a prophecy to make his first show the next game certainly was. He was entered into the Premiership at Manchester United and certainly made no embarrassment of himself up against the 55,000 spectators. However the rest of his league season was not overly blinding. He was then given two starts against Liverpool and Wimbledon and against the Dons, just his third game for the club he succesfully collected the man of the match award, a prize he was already beginning to look capable of winning plenty more of. However Redknapp then stepped in to try and keep Joe's feet on the ground and to protect the youngster from too early an introduction. He could only make another five substitute appearances for the duration of the season appearing for just minutes. However this wasn't a complete disappointment as he returned to help steer the youth team to waltz the FA Youth Cup with a 9-0 aggregate win against Coventry, to collect his first ever piece of silverware.<br>
Although making his first appearences for the first team in the league during this season, statistics show that he is still shows a large amount of inexperience. Although failing to once complete a match for the Hammers, if he had done his averages per minute would have meant he would take just two shots, one tackle and cross (of which his yet to be able to find a player with all four so far), along with 45 passes. Statistics which he will need to improve on drastically next year as an attacking midfielder. The defence side of his game was also slightly worrying. He has yet to even make a single block or interception whilst the number of fouls he commited per minute was certainly vearing towards the lower end of the premierships midfielders.<p>
1999-2000<br>
This was the year that Cole's career really began to take off. He looked ready to continue on as he was last year, a sparcly used teenager after he made an appearance in the first match, but only for a minute and then didn't get on the park again until mid-October. But that was when he finally seemed to have made it. From then on he was used in almost every single match. From mid-october until February he appeared in 16 of the sides 17 matches; he played for the full 90 minutes fourteen times, a feat he failed to accomplish in the league once last year. There was another hint as to just whether he could make the step up to the first team in the Worthington Cup when he came on in the Fourth round, and, with just a minute to go he scored the first goal of his career to send his team through to the last eight. It did take him until February the next year to collect what would just be his second goal of his career, but by then people were already talking about his chances of making it to Euro 2000. It looked possible when he was called up to the Under-21's for the game against Argentina. He played the last 45 minutes of the game, and it seemed that if he could keep fit he would at least be going to a European competition with the Under 21's. Unfortunately though it didn't quite work out as planned. Cole was given his first real taste of what the Premiership is really all about when in March he received his first major injury, a broken leg which would eventually rule out any possibility of a trip over to the continent that summer. And after making just those 19 starts before he was kicked out of the game it looks possible he might have something else in common with Gascoigne. Statistically though he continued to improve, both in his length of time on the pitch and the amount of effect he was having on the match. He will be hoping to try and improve yet again next year in his bid to match the expectations press have placed on him, and Hammers fans will be glad to know he'll be doing that with the London club after signing a new long term contract in March.<br>
In terms of league statistics Joe's game has vastly improved since the last campaign. Although the defensive side of his game is not the strongest, he showed he is willing to improve; per minute he completed more tackles as well as improving his data by helping the defence with blocks and interceptions for the first time too. It was his attacking play which was improving the most though. The season will be remembered for both his first goal and assist for the team. The length of time between each attempted pass, cross and dribble has also decreased as Joe slowly began to have a bigger effect on the outcome of the game as the season went on. He is an extremely clean footballer, his bookings, fouls and offsides all were occuring less frequently than in his first year and bettered his career average as well.<p>
2000-2001<br>
This season was a landmark one for Joe as he won his first England Cap. Admittedly only a 45 minute run out against Mexico, he still managed to produce some good runs from his left wing position and he did nothing to harm his chances of future call ups. He continued to develop at the lower international levels as well, with two more games for the Under 21’s in a 6-1 victory against Argentina and 3-1 defeat to Greece.<br>
At Club level he had another good season. He missed only eight league games and started a total of 24 of his 30 appearances. He began to improve his game defensively as well. He was able to increase his average number of tackles and blocks both increased as well as the number goals and shots that he had during the season. West Ham themselves did not have quite as successful a season as Joe though. It took the team until late September to earn a victory and move off the bottom of the table. And despite a good run following this West ham found themselves finishing in 15th place. A good cup run finished on something of a sour note as their defeat allowed Tottenham to reach the Semi-Finals of the FA Cup after a hard fought 2-3 defeat.<br>
With the leaving of Harry Redknapp his future was left in some confusion. However he has stayed on at the West Ham when others have left. The exit of Frank Lampard will offer Joe the chance to become an even more important part of West Ham’s season in 2001-2002, and with it being the last season for Cole to make any Under 21 appearances, he must begin to make an impact on the full international scene as well.<p>
