<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
The costs and general features described on this page relate specifically to the mortgage and unsecured credit facility elements of <I>together connections</I>.
        <P> <I>together connections</I> allows you to borrow any amount you choose, 
          subject to status and valuation, secured against your property. In addition 
          to this amount, you have the option to set up an unsecured credit facility 
          for any amount between &#163;1,000 and &#163;30,000, and also connect 
          a Savings Account (Save Direct connections) and a Current Account.
        </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B><I>together connections</I> INTEREST RATES</B></FONT><P>

        <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2> The interest rate charged 
        on <I>together connections</I> mortgage and loans is currently 5.69% P.A. 
        (<B>6.1% APR</B>) where the mortgage is up to 75% of the lower of the purchase price or value of your 
        property, 5.79% P.A. (<B>6.1% APR</B>) where the mortgage is up to 90% 
        of the lower of the purchase price or value of your property and 5.84% (<b>6.1% APR</b>) where the mortgage 
        is up to 95% of the lower of the purchase price or value of your property. These rates are variable. 
        <P>

The 95% loan to value product is guaranteed to be no more than 1.85% above the Bank of England Base Rate* until 1 January 2005. The 90% loan to value product will remain below the 95% loan to value product and the 75% loan to value product will remain below the 90% loan to value product for the life of the loan.<P>

After the guarantee rate period has ended, the variable interest rate that will then apply for the whole of the remaining loan term is guaranteed to be below our Standard Variable Mortgage Base Rate for existing customers. <I>together connections</I> does not qualify for a loyalty discount.
        <P> On the savings account the Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) where Connections 
          Interest is chosen is currently 5.69% where your mortgage is up to 75% 
          of the lower of the purchase price or value of your property, 5.79% where your mortgage is up to 90% 
          of the lower of the purchase price or value of your property and 5.84% where your mortgage is up to 
          95% of the lower of the purchase price or value of your property.
        <P>

*The Bank of England 's official dealing rate (the repo rate) as set by the Monetary Policy Committee. In the event that the Bank of England Base Rate ceases to exist, or becomes inappropriate as an index for the <I>together connections</I> rate guarantee, we reserve the right to replace it with such alternative rate or index, not controlled by us, that we consider to be the most appropriate in the circumstances.<P>

The interest rate conditions and guarantee apply to all the <I>together connections</I> products provided they remain connected to your mortgage.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>ARRANGEMENT FEE</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
A &#163;395 arrangement fee is payable on <I>together connections</I>. This fee can be added to your mortgage account on completion, where interest will be charged at the prevailing rate. Alternatively you can pay the fee up front. For loans over &#163;500,000 we reserve the right to charge a higher fee.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>HELP WITH COSTS OPTION (Excludes HERM, Buy to Let and CAT Standard Mortgages)</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
The option to receive a Help with Costs benefit is offered as follows:<P>

<UL>
<LI>&#163;1,000 for customers who are re-mortgaging to us.
<LI>&#163;500 for home purchase customers.
<LI>&#163;500 for existing mortgage customers taking a new mortgage product without moving home.
</UL><P>

This payment will be sent direct to the acting solicitor with the mortgage advance on completion. If you are an existing mortgage customer not moving home, the payment will be sent to you by cheque within 14 days of the date of transfer.<P>

The following conditions apply to the Help with Costs benefit:<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you move your Loan from us within the first two years following the date of completion or transfer of the Loan, then the Help with Costs benefit of &#163;1,000 must be repaid in full (&#163;500 for home purchase customers and existing mortgage customers taking a new mortgage product without moving home).<P>

If you move your Loan from us in the third year, following the date of completion of this Loan, then half the amount of the Help with Costs benefit must be repaid i.e. &#163;500 (&#163;250 for home purchase customers existing mortgage customers taking a new mortgage product without moving home). <P>

<LI>If you decide to move house and simultaneously redeem your Loan and take a new mortgage product with us or simultaneously redeem your Loan and transfer this mortgage product to your new mortgage on your new home you will not have to repay the Help with Costs benefit, provided legal completion takes place. The remaining period for repaying the Help with Costs benefit from your original Loan (see 1. above), will be transferred to your new loan.<P>

If you take a new mortgage product with us without moving home you will not have to repay the Help with Costs benefit. The remaining period for repaying the Help with Costs benefit from your original Loan, (see 1. above), will be transferred to your new loan.<P>

Repayment of the Help with Costs benefit will only apply if you move your mortgage from us within 3 years of completion of this or any other mortgage product(s) which has the Help with Costs benefit and you do not complete a new loan with us within 3 months of redemption.<P>

<LI>If you move home and do not simultaneously redeem your Loan and transfer this mortgage product or take a new mortgage product with us, the Help with Costs benefit will be charged as outlined in 1. above on redemption of this Loan. This will then be refunded to you, provided you return to us for your new mortgage within 3 months of redemption. Where this happens, the remaining period for repaying the Help with Costs benefit from your original Loan, (see 1. above), will be transferred to the new loan. Subsequent repayment of this Help with Costs benefit is outlined in 2 above.<P>

If you have previously received Help with Costs benefit where the remaining period for repaying this benefit has been transferred to your current mortgage product this remaining period will be transferred to your new Loan.
</OL>
        <P> <B>LEGAL FEES FOR RE-MORTGAGES</B>
        <P>

We can instruct a Panel Firm of solicitors to act on our behalf in a re-mortgage transaction. We have a dedicated panel of solicitors who are conveyancing specialists with proven service levels and fast turn around times.<P>

With this option you will be responsible for our legal fees at the standard rate of &#163;250 in England and Wales and &#163;350 in Scotland (inclusive of VAT and standard disbursements) and these will be debited to your mortgage account on completion of the re-mortgage. You can pay this sum at any time after completion. However, we will charge interest at the rate charged to the mortgage until the legal fees are paid.<P>

Please note that the fees mentioned above are for standard re-mortgage transactions. Any extra legal work or additional disbursements will be agreed and must be paid in advance. Extra work would include the purchase of land, and additional disbursements would include any first registration fee and landlords registration fee. These additional fees cannot be added to your mortgage account.<P>

This offer is only available when one of our re-mortgage panel firm of solicitors is instructed.
        <P> <B>LEGAL FEES FOR HOME PURCHASESLegal fees for Home Purchases</B>
        <P>

Home purchase customers can also use the panel solicitors, and prices will be agreed on an individual basis. These fees cannot be added to the loan.
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>LEGAL WORK</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
A firm of solicitors will need to act on our behalf in completing your mortgage (or remortgage) and unsecured credit facility. To avoid duplication of work, the same firm will normally also act for you unless you are using our panel solicitors - see legal fees for remortgages and house purchases.<P>

The solicitor acting for you will advise you about the legal costs and any additional disbursements or outlays such as Stamp Duty that are due when buying your property or remortgaging.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>VALUATION FEE</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
We will need to value your property in order to ensure that it represents adequate security for the loan that you require.<P>

The fees shown include a non refundable &#163;125 administration charge. The balance is the valuer's fee.<BR>
For loans in excess of &#163;500,000 a desktop valuation assessment will also be carried out. The fee for this is &#163;75.<P>

<B>RE-INSPECTIONS</B><P>

Occasionally, it is necessary for our valuer to re-inspect your property after the initial valuation has been completed. Usually, this is to verify that any new building work or essential repairs have been completed satisfactorily. If a re-inspection of the property is necessary, either before or after completion of your loan has taken place, a standard fee of &#163;55 will be charged for each re-inspection.<P>

Once the valuer has re-inspected the property, we will be able to tell you whether we are able to release withheld funds to you and whether any further re-inspections may be needed.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
All new mortgage products are available to both new customers and existing Northern Rock borrowers. If you are an existing customer with us you can transfer to <I>together connections</I> even if you are not moving home. You will be required to pay a &#163;125 administration fee, and a &#163;195 arrangement fee. You will also have to pay a sum equivalent to any Early Repayment Charge applicable to your current mortgage product. If you are increasing your borrowing there is an additional fee of &#163;195. The fees and the sum equivalent to any Early Repayment Charge applicable can be added to your new mortgage where interest will be charged at the prevailing rate. Alternatively you can pay the fees upfront.<P>

If you already have an unsecured cash reserve linked to an existing mortgage product with us a further unsecured cash reserve is not guaranteed and will be subject to underwriting. The maximum  unsecured cash reserve amount available to existing customers at any point in time will be &#163;30,000.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>RISK CHARGE FEE</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
We will pay any Risk Charge Fee on your behalf. You should refer to <A HREF="./tcon_09borrow.asp"><I>together connections</I> - How much you can borrow</A> for details of what a Risk Charge is.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>AUTOMATIC BANK TRANSFERS</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
Normally, all releases of <I>together connections</I> mortgage and unsecured credit facility funds will be through the Bankers Automated Clearing Services (BACS). We do not make a charge for releasing funds through the BACS system.<P>

However, in those cases where extreme urgency is involved, the solicitor acting for you may request that funds are released using a same day automatic bank transfer (CHAPS). If funds are released by CHAPS, a &#163;30 transfer fee will be charged to your mortgage account following completion. We will follow the instructions received from the solicitor acting for you about the method that we should use in releasing funds.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
<I>together connections</I> allows you to repay your loan in full or in part at any time without incurring an Early Repayment Charge. When you repay your loan in full, interest will be charged up to and including the day on which the loan is repaid.<P>

If you fully repay the mortgage part of your <I>together connections</I> loan or transfer to another mortgage product, including another <I>together</I> mortgage product, the rate of interest charged to any unsecured credit facility arranged through the <I>together connections</I> product will immediately be changed to 3% above Northern Rock's Standard Variable Mortgage Base Rate.<P>

If you fully repay your <I>together connections</I> mortgage you will also be asked to repay any Help with Costs benefit. Please see section headed 'Help with Costs Option' for details.<P>

In addition, any savings or current account will be disconnected.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
The normal day to day management of <I>together connections</I> will usually be conducted free of additional charges.<P>

However, we do charge for providing some specific services and where these apply, our current charges are shown below. VAT is not usually payable on these fees but where VAT does apply this is stated. These charges may be varied. Full details of any charges relating to the Savings Account and Current Account are covered in separate leaflets.<P>

All loans must be repaid by Direct Debit or be subject to an annual charge (currently &#163;25).

This charge will also apply where a Direct Debit is cancelled and replaced with another payment method.

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>SAVINGS ACCOUNT (SAVE DIRECT CONNECTIONS)</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
By connecting a Save Direct Connections account to your mortgage you can choose to receive Connections Benefit which means you pay no interest on part of your mortgage and unsecured loan balance. Alternatively you can choose Connections Interest (annual interest only) where you will earn the same rate of interest on your savings as you are paying on your mortgage subject to the deduction of basic rate tax (where appropriate). If your accounts are disconnected for any reason, you will no longer be eligible for Connections Benefit or Connections Interest.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>CURRENT ACCOUNT</B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
By connecting a Current Account to your mortgage you can choose to receive Connections Benefit which means you pay no interest on part of your mortgage and unsecured loan. If you opt not to receive Connection Benefit, interest will be paid at the prevailing Current Account rate subject to the deduction of basic rate tax (where appropriate). Further details of our Current Account charges will be sent to you after completion of your mortgage.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=3><B>GENERAL NOTES ON INTEREST CHARGES FOR <I>together connections</I></B></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2>
The rate at which interest is charged will be shown in any formal Offer of Loan or Credit Agreement issued to you. The interest rate is variable. Any subsequent changes will be notified to you in writing.<P>

Interest will be charged from the day the mortgage monies are sent to your solicitor/licensed conveyancer until the end of that first calendar month. Subsequent interest calculations are based on the amount owing at the end of each previous calendar month.<P>

Interest is charged to your loan account, in advance, at the beginning of each calendar month.<P>

Upon receipt of any loan payment or credit, the loan balance is reduced and the monthly interest charge will be adjusted, thereby providing an immediate benefit in the form of a reduced interest charge.<P>

Where Connections Benefit is chosen we will calculate the average cleared funds in your savings/current account. The average cleared funds for the month will be set against the capital balance upon which the mortgage and any unsecured loan interest is charged. The result is that you reduce the amount you pay in interest on your borrowing.<P>

Any unpaid fees/charges will attract interest charges from the actual date that the fee/charge is made.
        <P> You will be asked to make an initial loan payment when legal completion 
          of your mortgage has taken place. This represents the initial interest 
          charged to your mortgage prior to your first full monthly payment becoming 
          due. As this initial interest charge will not be collected with your 
          monthly payments, you will need to make separate arrangements to pay 
          it. An additional 3% above Northern Rock's Standard Variable Mortgage 
          Base Rate will be charged if you repay the mortgage but wish to retain 
          the unsecured credit facility (see heading "<A HREF="#EarlyRepaymentCharge">Early 
          Repayment Charge</A>").

        <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE=2> <I>together connections</I> 
        <P> The <i>together connections</i> rates are effective 10.05.2002. The 
          interest rate charged on <I>together</I> <i>connections</i> is currently 
          5.69% (<strong>6.1% APR</strong>) for secured loans up to and including 
          75% of the lower of the purchase price or property's value, 5.79% (<strong>6.1% 
          APR</strong>) for mortgages up to and including 90% of the lower of 
          the purchase price or property's value and 5.84% (<strong>6.1% APR</strong>) 
          for mortgages up to and including 95% of the the lower of the purchase 
          price or property's value. The rates are variable. The 95% loan to value 
          product is guaranteed to be no more than 1.85% above the Bank of England 
          Base Rate (currently 4.00%) until 1 January 2005. The 90% loan to value 
          product will remain below the 95% loan to value product and the 75% 
          loan to value product will remain below the 90% loan to value product 
          both for the life of the loans. 
        <P> After the guarantee period has ended, the variable interest rate that 
          will then apply for the whole of the remaining loan term is guaranteed 
          to be below our Standard Variable Mortgage Base Rate for existing customers.

        <P>Representative example: A capital and interest mortgage of &pound;54,000 
          over a 25 year term completing on 1.6.2002 (300 monthly payments), secured 
          against a property being purchased for &pound;60,000. 31 monthly secured 
          loan payments of &pound;341.87 (calculated at 5.79% <B>6.1% APR</B>), followed by 269 
          monthly secured loan payments of &pound;340.67 (rate assumed to be 5.75%). 
          Total amount payable &pound;102,848.00. A capital and interest unsecured 
          loan of &pound;18,000 over a 25 year term completing on 1.6.2002. 31 monthly 
          payments of &pound;113.68 (calculated at 5.79% <B>6.1% APR</B>) followed by 269 monthly 
          payments of &pound;113.28 (rate assumed to be 5.75%). Total amount payable 
          &pound;33,933.00. Calculated to include an arrangement fee of &pound;395, 
          solicitors costs of &pound;117.50 and a valuation fee of &pound;235.00. 
          For the purpose of this example we have assumed that the applicant has 
          not taken the Help with Costs option. Both loans will be collected as 
          one monthly payment. APRs may vary depending on the repayment term chosen.
        <P> <B>ANNUAL EQUIVALENT RATE (AER)</B><BR>
          The Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) is a notional rate which illustrates 
          the contractual rate (excluding any bonus interest) as if paid and compounded 
          on annual basis. If Connections Interest is chosen the AER payable on 
          your savings balance would be equivalent to the interest rate charged 
          on your <I>together connections</I> mortgage.
        <P> This information should be read in conjunction with the <I>together 
          connections</I> product pages and the terms and conditions for all the connected 
          products when they are sent to you. In addition, you should also have 
          read those <A HREF="../../mortgages/generic/mortgage_prodsins1.asp">insurance 
          sections</A> relating to any of our insurance products in which you 
          are interested.
