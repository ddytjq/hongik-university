Cooling System</A>
</H2>

<P>The sensitivity of the HFI critically depends
on the temperature of the detectors. The cooling scheme
that allows to cool at 0.1K the 48 bolometers
and their filters is based on technical solutions that have
been successfully tested in flight or
have been demonstrated on ground applications and are being
qualified for space. Each cooling
system takes advantage of the previous one in an optimal way,
following the arrangement of Figure 1.

<P>The precooling of the instrument to 50/60K is
insured by the Planck Payload Module thanks to passive
radiation to free space, which can be very efficient
in the environment of the Earth-Sun Lagrangian L2
orbit of Planck. A series of radiators (called V-grooves) 
thermally decouple the payload from the warm Service Module,
and provide intermediate temperature stages for the payload
structures, piping, harness, and waveguides.
 
<P>A closed cycle cooler using Joule-Thomson (J-T)
expansion of hydrogen and sorption compressors
insures cooling of both the LFI and the HFI to about 20K
(the sorption cooler, see Figure 2).
The J-T valve delivers a mixture of liquid
and gas at about 17.5K. The 20 K sorption cooler is being developed
for HFI and LFI by NASA/JPL.

<P>A first high efficiency
heat exchanger cools to 18K the helium flows of the 4K
and the 0.1K stages. This heat exchanger is thermally
decoupled from the one used to cool the LFI
20K plate, for which a larger temperature drop
in the exchanger is acceptable. The shielded cable from
the 4K box to the JFET box 
 is thermally attached to the 20K stage in order to
reduce heat loads on the 4K stage. Joule-Thomson expansion
of helium compressed by mechanical
compressors (Figure 3) is used to cool the 4K stage of the HFI.
That stage supports the back-to-back horns that
insure the optical coupling of the detectors with the telescope.

<P>Lower temperatures (to 0.1 K) are obtained 
by dilution of <SUP>3</SUP>He  in  <sup>4</sup>He (Figure 4).
A 1.6K stage is generated by J-T expansion of mixed helium.
This stage supports filters and intercepts heat from the 4K stage.
The 0.1K stage supports the bolometers, thermometers, heaters,
and filters. Its temperature is controlled
thanks to a closed loop active system.
The additional cooling power available from the mixture of  <SUP>3</SUP>He
and <sup>4</sup>He under 1.6K is used to intercept heat inputs along
the mechanical support of the 0.1K stage.
The tubes from and to each stage are attached
to form heat exchangers for all circulating fluids in order
to minimise thermal losses.

<P>
The 0.1 K Open Cycle Dilution/Joule-Thomson Refrigerator has been
developed at the Centre de Recherches des Tr&#232;s Basses
Temperatures (CRTBT) in Grenoble (France) (Benoit <I>et&nbsp;al.</I>994). 
It uses a new dilution principle
based on friction that does not need gravity to operate.
Its cooling power depends on the gas flow, which is very low and thus allows 
sufficient gas
storage to achieve long mission life. 
For a total (<SUP>3</SUP>He and <SUP>4</SUP>He)
flow rate of 12 <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$\mu$">mole/s, a cooling power of 100 nW at 0.1 K has been
demonstrated. In the same process, the mixture is expanded in a Joule-Thomson
valve, producing a cooling power of several hundreds of <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$\mu$">W at 1.6 K. 
This is enough to insure a proper insulation of the 0.1 K stage from
the radiative and conductive thermal loads coming from the 4 K stage. The
principle of this cryogenic architecture and its 
+/-1 g operation have been
successfully proven with a demonstration model, and
qualification of this system for space operation is in progress.


<P>
Bolometric detectors of the type to be used in the HFI are known to be
sensitive to microphonic noise induced by mechanical vibrations.  Since the
instrument will operate in conjunction with mechanical compressors, it is
important to verify that the cooler vibration does not cause degradation of the
performance of the detectors. As initial measures, the compressors
will be mounted back-to-back (in the case of the 50-80 K cooler resulting in
the addition of one completely redundant cooler), and driven with electronic
circuits especially designed to minimize vibrations. 
 Secondly, the mechanical design of the platforms which support the
coolers can be optimized to an extent where the transfer of vibrations from the
platforms to the focal plane is suppressed to acceptable levels. 
 It is worth noting here that the mechanical excitation by the
compressors -if at all present- occurs at frequencies higher than 35 Hz, which 
would only contaminate
the measurement of spherical harmonics higher than 
<it>l</it> &#126; 2000.
