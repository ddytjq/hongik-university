              <h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FF8040"><small><small>Special
              Note to our readers</small></small></font></h3>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="1">We have previously reviewed John
              Kresse's fine video called Offensive and Defensive Game Winners
              this past year.&nbsp; Since this is exactly the same material we are attaching the content of that review below for those that may
              not have previously read our summary of that work.<br>
              What is different is that this is the first coaching related
              product that we are aware of that comes in DVD format.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="1">We believe in the future of DVD
              and believe it will
              be one of the primary methods for delivering coaching content in
              the future. It has many advantages over tapes, books and other media
              efforts.&nbsp; First much more information can be stored on a disk
              in DVD format than in others.&nbsp; That is why you are now seeing
              many motion pictures released in DVD format.&nbsp; Interviews with
              coaches may be added (although there are none included in this
              initial one), you have the ability to adjust camera angles of the court, and you can easily take
              your DVD control device to navigate quickly to a digital point
              anywhere in the DVD at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
              <h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FF8040" size="1">Here's What You
              Get on DVD</font></h3>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="1">DVD will play on your home DVD
              or, in our case on our office computer's DVD.&nbsp; Upon loading
              the DVD you get the same introductory video clips that you get in
              a regular video.&nbsp; However you are quickly taken to a
              clickable control panel (for computer based DVD's) or can use your
              remote control device (for home DVD's) to navigate to the part of
              the DVD which most interests you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="1">This on screen control panel has
              five features including Play Program, Alternate Angle, Coach's
              Play Book, Order Information, and a handy DVD Tutorial in case you
              are relatively inexperienced at using DVD's.&nbsp; The navigation
              is simply between the different sections.&nbsp; With a digital
              signal you can move quickly between the plays you want or need to
              review which is much more efficient with your time than having to
              fast forward or backward to a point in a normal video. In fact
              this method of navigation is much more user friendly than any we
              have used in the coaching education field and we think you'll
              appreciate it too.</font></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="1">We did find that this particular
              DVD did not have a lot of alternate action angles and when it did
              it gave you a choice between just two (at court level and above
              court).&nbsp; However the creation of DVD's for coaching is still
              in the very early stages and these types of features will become
              enhanced for use with time and experience.&nbsp; It does not in
              any way detract from the quality material Coach Kresse offers or
              the more flexible learning experience that a DVD provides over
              other forms of media.&nbsp; In fact it's sort of a cross between a
              book with a table of contents but with the action in visual form,
              the best of both worlds.&nbsp; Be aware, as we have just
              discovered that DVD are formatted by regions in the world and this
              particular DVD is a Region 1 (USA, Canada, and US Territories
              only).&nbsp; We hope in the future that the publishers of such
              material will create them in an all-region format get around the
              old PAL vs. NTCS problems many international coaches run into with
              North American made videotapes.&nbsp; But that is not the case
              with this first release.</font></p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>Every coach
              is faced multiple time during the course of a season with end of
              game situations that quickly decide a winner and loser.&nbsp; Here
              is an informative new video by John Kresse, at College of
              Charleston, which addresses both offensive and defensive decision
              making at the games conclusion.&nbsp; Coach Kresse is the second
              winningest active coach percentage wise in NCAA Division I
              basketball and it should come as no surprise his teams are called
              the &quot;giant killers&quot; at NCAA Tournament time.&nbsp; This
              video is about 2/3 late game offensive special plays and 1/3
              defensive situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></small></font></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>The key
              point made by Coach Kresse is that you must put your players in a
              position to win at the end of games.&nbsp; This means have both a
              philosophy of what you are going to do in each potential game
              deciding situation, but also that you must practice those
              situations.&nbsp; This video will go a long way toward helping you
              make decisions regarding your preparedness in the games most
              critical moments.</small></small></font></p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>The
              offensive portion of Game Winners is divided into three
              sections.&nbsp; The first is called Full Court situations.&nbsp;
              Coach Kresse teaches five different full court situations <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/preparation_is_putting.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">by
              both showing basic and counter options when the defense takes away
              your primary go to option.&nbsp; Amongst those plays shown are
              what he calls 94 to score where you must take the ball the full
              length of the court in 6 to 9 seconds.&nbsp; In some cases you may
              want to rush the ball to the mid-court line to call a time out to
              set up a last second half court shot play and he teaches you a
              play called Box Score or Box Time Out which can be run in this
              situation.&nbsp; Getting a three point shot when needing two or
              three points to win a game is the third set play he describes in a
              play called Triple.&nbsp; The used of a curved line and
              intelligently placing the shooters and screeners make it difficult
              for defenses to switch without creating a mismatch in the open
              court on this one.</small></small></font></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>All teams
              are eventually put into the situation where you need on long
              touchdown type pass to win a game with 1-3 seconds to play.&nbsp;
              The last two plays in the full court set are called Long for 2 and
              Long for 3.&nbsp; The goal being to isolate a key player near the
              basket to get the best chance at a high percentage shot.&nbsp;
              This section also contains an excellent verbal description by
              Coach Kresse of how to teach your players decision making with 3
              seconds or less to go in a game.&nbsp; Things like must you simply
              turn and shoot, or you have the time to take one hard dribble and
              still get your shot cleanly away.&nbsp; This kind of detail is
              what makes John Kresse's video's exceptional and Game Winners is
              another in his long line of excellent teaching videos on key
              elements of offensive and defensive basketball (see our reviews of
              <a href="../videos/jkresse_review.asp">Attacking Zones</a>, and <a href="../videos/jkresse2_zonepress_review.asp">2-2-1
              3/4 Court Zone Press</a>).</small></small></font></p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>The video
              continues with six different half court set plays.&nbsp; The first
              is called Havlicek taken from the Red Auerbach Celtic great teams
              designed to get a score when the ball is taken out at the
              mid-court line.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second plays is called Slide an
              designed to get you a score when the ball is taken out from inside
              the mid-court line to just above <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/we_practice_plays.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">the
              low block when there are between 3 and 5 seconds left in the
              game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Side Out, a third play from the sideline
              inbounds is designed to get the ball into the hands of your surest
              dribbler and let them penetrate to break down the defense for a
              pass or score with 3-6 seconds let on the clock.&nbsp; The fourth
              play is called Plus and in this one Coach Kresse teaches you how
              to get a 3-point shot off with only 1, 2 or 3 seconds to
              play.&nbsp; If you have a talented 4 man you may enjoy the fifth
              play in this Half Court dissertation called Cross which is
              designed to set up your 4 man for a cross court pass near the
              basket against a very aggressive deny type defense.&nbsp; The last
              play in this section is called Corner where you must score with
              but a few seconds on the clock after a ball has been deflected out
              of bounds deep in a corner.&nbsp; It can be used to get the ball
              inbounds safely against either a man or zone defense.</small></small></font></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>The last
              part of the Offense section of Game Winners includes Coach
              Kresse's pet play against either a man or zone defense when you
              need a 3 point shot with less than 3 seconds to go.&nbsp; It is
              called Arizona and he copied it from the Lute Olsen team that beat
              his Charleston team with this play in the NCAA Tournament a few
              years back.&nbsp; In it he makes one of his great teaching points
              by saying &quot;we practice this and all our plays so that our
              shooter can catch and shoot the ball without looking where the
              three-point line is, so the shooter can focus on making the
              shot.&quot;&nbsp; All of Coach Kresse's videos teach you specific
              play, substantive teaching points, and why you must teach certain
              details of the game and <i>Game Winners</i> is no exception.</small></small></font></p>
              <h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><small><small><font color="#FF8040">Coming
              From Behind</font></small></small></h3>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small>A video
              called Game Winners might lead you to think it is purely about
              offense, but Coach Kresse spends about 15 minutes of the video
              talking about playing from behind.&nbsp; He demonstrates a concept
              he calls &quot;Centerfield&quot; which is what he teaches when his
              teams are down 1 or 2 points with 1-10 seconds to play.&nbsp;
              Teaching points like &quot;you must full front but all the time
              peaking over one's shoulder to know where the ball is at <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/if_you_are_behind.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">all
              times&quot;, and &quot;on screens and exchanges we automatically
              switch every situation and continue to front&quot; are useful tips
              for any coach.&nbsp; Out of &quot;centerfield&quot; he introduces
              the &quot;centerfield trap&quot; which is used when your team is
              down 1 or 2 points with 11-20 seconds to play.&nbsp; A third
              section on defending when behind covers complete denial when your
              team is down less than 6 points with 2 minutes or less to
              play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Game Winners briefly discusses
              what Coach Kress calls the Run and Double Team when you need the
              ball and the offense must bring the ball from the back court into
              the front court. I really latched onto his use of the verbal cues
              regarding the double which he calls&nbsp; &quot;entice, force,
              double, rotate, and steal&quot; in teaching late game trap and
              rotate situations to regain possession of the ball.</small></small></font></p>
              <h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><small><small><font color="#FF8040">The Sum of
              Your Preparation</font></small></small></h3>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000"><small><small><i>Game
              Winners</i> concludes with Coach Kresse five summary points
              regarding how to better prepare your team for late game
              situations.&nbsp; These things involve practice and execution of
              set plays, scouting opponents, knowing when and who to foul, and
              being organized in the huddle by having diagram already
              available.&nbsp; There may be other videos that can teach you
              about game winning shots, but the sum of this video will stimulate
              your coaching brain, may cause you to re-evaluate how prepared you
              really are, and will leave you with a desire to improve your teams
              preparedness so that you do have the best chance to win when you
              need that last second shot or steal.&nbsp; I'm a little wiser and
              better prepared after seeing this fine effort!&nbsp; In addition
              we were pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and quality of
              this first effort on DVD.</small></small></font></p>
