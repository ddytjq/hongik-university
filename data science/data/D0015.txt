<P>
<H3>Houston we have a problem!  The need for error-handling!</H3>
</P>

<P>
As you read this, you probably just started out learning Java and maybe even started
programming as such.  Every beginner pretty soon realizes that programming is an error-prone
job and sometimes can become frustrating.
</P>

<P>
While frustration is something most people can handle to some extent, I am sure
that you wouldn't want to fly on a plane that uses software that would not run properly. 
As the Apollo 11 crew  was orbiting the earth they were glad that most of their (about) 
300,000 lines of code (LOC) were working correctly. With today's operating systems 
tending to have more than 3-million LOC and hundred's of people (including salesmen!)
working on it or having an impact on it you can be sure that there are errors somewhere.
</P>

<P>
Sure, you could always blame the user, but that is in no way satisfying.  What you 
would want to do is writing robust code.  And in order to do that you'll have to take
a couple of precautions.  The one precaution we're going to talk about in the course
of this tutorial is that you have to <STRONG>analyze the unspoken ideas</STRONG> that 
lie implicitely underneath the cover of the programming task.  Does
that sound weird?  Well, this is pretty much all what Error- and 
Exception-handling is about.<A HREF = #footnote1><SUP>1</SUP></A><A Name = "backFN1"></A>
</P>

<P>
The following example will make it clearer:  Let's say that your 
programming task is writing a calculator-program.  You have to implement methods for
addition ("+"), subtraction("-"), multiplication("*"), and division("/").  You might start
writing a method like this:
</P>

<HR>

<P><PRE><CODE>
 1. <STRONG>public double</STRONG>  mathRoutines (String operator) {
 2. <STRONG>if</STRONG>  (operator == "+") {
 3.     result = leftValue + rightValue;
 4.   } <STRONG>else if</STRONG>  (operator == "-") {
 5.     result = leftValue - rightValue;
 6.   } <STRONG>else if</STRONG>  (operator == "*") {
 7.     result = leftValue * rightValue;
 8.   } <STRONG>else if</STRONG> (operator == "/") {
 9.     result = leftValue + rightValue;
10.  } 
11.   <STRONG>return</STRONG> result;
12. }
</CODE></PRE></P>

<HR>

<P>
This does look inviting at first but as the user starts playing with your 
calculator he/she will sooner or later try this: 
</P>

<P align = "center">
<STRONG>someValue / 0</STRONG>
</P>

<P>
Now what's gonna happen?  Would you say that this is a user-error? No man in 
the world is able to calculate this, do you think computers are?  Well, 
certainly not.  This leads us back to the assumptions that are implicitely made: 
You assumed that your user would know that he must not try to divide any number
by zero (you have to admit that you assumed that the user would act according to
that knowledge, too).  To get things straight:  The only assumption you should
make is that no matter how good a program you come up with, there'll always be 
a user who will find errors!  If this assumption turns out to be wrong, nobody
will blame you for it.  If you divide anyNumber by 0 in your plane's 
steering-software (imagine the pilot inputting a 0 by simply doing his job 
steering the plane) you'll be in great danger since everybody will blame you 
if not only the system crashes but the plane crashes, too!

<H2>I object!  Error-handling when errors occur!</H2>
</P>
<A NAME = "usualOOP"></A>

<P>
<H3>Just the usual OOP</H3>
</P>

<P>
As you are learning Java I'm sure it is not the first time that you run across
the object-oriented-programming-paradigm (OOP).  While this is not the place
to cover OOP as such, we will have to mention a couple of OOP-ideas first in
order to fully understand the way Java handles errors.
</P>

<P>
Have you ever been standing in a forest and you couldn't see the forest for 
all of the trees?  I did - but it took me quite some time to realize that
this little saying expresses the major advantage of OOP over other 
programming-paradigms - it has to do with the way we look at things.
</P>

<P>
If I told you, we were having a field-day and we would visit a place where 
we found a great number of brown stems with green ends, flying animals, little
brown animals with six feet that are busy building little hills and it will
be darker than in the open field, you'd sit there and wonder:  is he talking
about a forest, or what!?!  If instead I told you, we were having a field-day 
in a forest, you'd exactly know what I was talking about and pretty much knew 
what to expect (trees, birds, leafs, needles, ants, darkness, plants...).
</P>

<P>
An average person can handle up to 7 pieces of information simultaneously.  If 
you started out describing your forest by explicitly naming every single thing 
you might encounter (little kids often do this!), anybody who doesn't know that 
you are talking about a forest will run into problems once you reached the 7th 
piece of information (they simply run out of memory!). By naming the object 
(it's a forest) most people will grasp the idea more easily than by describing 
every single thing that's got to do with it (maybe Nanook sitting in his igloo
won't).  
</P>

<P>
Your computer doesn't care about all this, it doesn't know what abstraction is.  
On the other hand human beings very heavily depend on abstraction and use
it every day (in pretty much every sentence they say).  Just one more example to 
make this clear:  Try to follow this question:  Could you please use about half 
a liter of the chemical substance H<SUB>2</SUB>O, heat it until it's boiling, while heating 
the chemical substance H<SUB>2</SUB>O grind some of these dark brown dried fruits we got at 
the supermarket, put three to four tea-spoons of the ground fruit into the 
boiling chemical substance H<SUB>2</SUB>O, wait for two or three minutes, fill the 
resulting liquid into a jar made of ... Add the rest yourself, try asking 
your friend/husband/wife this question and find out if he/she will bring you 
a cup of java.<A HREF="#footnote2"><SUP>2</SUP></A><A Name = "backFN2"></A>
</P>

<P>
In Java you have to create <CITE>classes</CITE> in order to get a <cite>template</cite> 
(you might call it a <CITE>pattern</CITE>, too) for your objects.  Using 
this <CITE>template</CITE> (the class) you can create as many alike objects 
as you want. Imagine a dress-pattern.  If you have a nice dress-pattern, you 
can taylor the same dress many times.  Once you have more than one, you might 
start dressing beautiful looking models send them to a fashion parade and
sell them (not the models, the dresses!) - you <STRONG>really</STRONG> can 
do something with the dresses.  Same with Java.  The class is your pattern 
but it's pretty much of no use until you created an <EM>instance</EM> of your class 
(this is usually called the <CITE>object</CITE> in OOP-literature).
</P>

<P>
If you had a faulty template you'd run out of business just as fast as you
started it.  This is where Exceptions come in. Let's assume you are a 
successful fashion-designer and you have your own little boutique.  In
comes the user - male, long messy hair, greasy hands, in one of his hands:
his bicycle!  Things like that happen and you have to be prepared for this.
So what would you do?  You would take care that he doesn't touch a thing and
try to talk him into leaving your boutique.
</P>

<P>
With that in mind we return to our calculator-example and take a first look at 
the Java-syntax for Exception-handling.  
</P>

<HR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC = "rockingCondy.jpg"></TD>
<TD>
<P>
<CODE><PRE>
 1. <FONT Color = #00ff30>// initialize the value</FONT>
 2. <STRONG>double</STRONG> myDoubleValue = 0d;
 3. <FONT Color = #00ff30>// the method-call</FONT>
 4. inverseValue(myDoubleValue);
 5. <FONT Color = #00ff30>// the method</FONT>
 6. public double inverseValue(double aValue);
 7.   <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
 8.     <STRONG>return</STRONG> 1/aValue;
 9.   } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (Exception e) {
10.     System.out.println("You 
11.     cannot divide by zero and 
12.     I can't do this either!");
13.  }
14. }
</P></PRE>
</CODE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<HR>

<P>  
The parts of the code that are of interest are the <CODE><STRONG>try</STRONG>
{...}</CODE> and the <CODE><STRONG>catch</STRONG>{...}</CODE>-blocks.  Once
you found out that dividing anyValue by 0 is a no-no, you would usually try 
to avoid the error in the first place (remember the greasy and long-haired 
bike-rider - it would obviously be best if you kept him from entering your 
boutique).  This is not what Java does.  Java lets the program run into the 
error without turning a hair!  Now what?  Why would Java want to do that?
</P>

<P> 
Well, Java takes an OOP-approach:  It assumes that most of the time your code
will be working correctly and that there is no need to check if your divisor
is a 0 or not.  So instead of using a time-consuming <CODE>if</CODE>-statement 
every time your method is called, trying to prevent the 0 from entering it, 
you let each and every value that comes along enter right into your method 
and watch what happens.  This is exactly what <CODE>try</CODE> indicates - try
out everything that's surrounded by the braces <CODE>{}</CODE> and see if it 
works.  If not, you have to do something about it - and this is called
<STRONG>error-handling</STRONG>.<A HREF=#footnote3><SUP>3</SUP></A><A NAME="backFN3"></A>

<P>
Error-handling in Java is built on throwing Errors and Exceptions.  You can 
compare it with the owner of the boutique:  The moment our biker enters the
boutique, he throws him out.  While throwing someone or something out might 
sound like fun we will cover the throws later and take a look at the counterpart 
first: the <STRONG>catch</STRONG>.  
</P>

<P>
Our biker will land back out on the streets (hopefully softly) but not before
you gave him some information such as:  <CITE>Yes, certainly we are open to the 
public, but please leave your bike outside, and wash your hands before you
come in.</CITE><A HREF = "#footnote4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><A NAME = "backFN4"></A>
This is pretty much the way Java handles it.  The Error- or Exception-object is 
thrown and instead of letting it fall on the ground you catch it in a
<CODE><STRONG>catch</STRONG></CODE>-clause.  The syntax is 
</P>

<HR>

<CODE>
<PRE>
1. <STRONG>catch</STRONG>(ThrowableObject fancyName) {
2. <FONT COLOR = #00ff30>// your error-handling code here</FONT>
3. }
</PRE>
</CODE> 
</OL>

<HR>

<P>
The first line is like a method's signature where <CODE><STRONG>catch</STRONG></CODE>
is the method's name and the method gets a <CITE>Throwable</CITE>-object as
parameter which you can name anyway you
want.<A HREF = "#footnote5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><A NAME = "backFN5"></A>

The second line is where your coding-task starts.  Usually you would want your
user to know that something was going wrong and ask him if he might want 
to reconsider his input.  Maybe you just want to exit your program with a loud 
bang and then again maybe...  It's up to you.

The third line simply ends the <CODE><STRONG>catch</STRONG></CODE>-clause
and indicates that your done.
</P>

<P>
<A Name ="throw junk away"></A>
<H3>Throw that junk away!</H3>
</P>

<P>
While there are many useful methods in Java that automatically throw some
kind of Exception, there will be times when you have to throw the junk your 
method cannot handle away with the help of Java's
<CODE><STRONG>throw</STRONG></CODE>-keyword in order to provide some
error-handling of your own.
</P>

<P>
The way to do that is easy, you simply have to include something like the 
following in your method:
</P>

<P></P>
<HR>

<CODE>
<PRE>
1. <STRONG>if</STRONG> (greasyBikerComesIn == true) {
2.   <STRONG>throw new</STRONG> Exception("Yes, certainly we are open
3.     to the public, but please leave your bike outside, 
4.     and wash your hands before you come in.")
5. }
</PRE>
</CODE>

<HR>

<P>
The moment a certain error-condition is met you create a new instance of the 
Exception-class. Usually you would want the Exception-object to hold a message 
that gives you a clue about what happened.  So instead of using the 
Exception()-constructor you use the Exception(String message)-constructor of 
the Exception-class to create your object and enter a String that is more 
meaningful than "OOPS!" as a message - actually the example is ok for
teaching-purposes but not for the real (?) programming-world.
</P>

<P>
As you were following the course of the tutorial closely, you will be a little
disappointed by now.  The first LOC includes error-checking just the way you 
always did it:  <CODE><STRONG>if</STRONG></CODE>-statements.  This is the
reason why you do not use any <CODE><STRONG>if</STRONG></CODE>-statements
in your <CODE><STRONG>try</STRONG></CODE>-blocks - you do not want to
double-check each and everything.  
</P>

<P>
While there are many reasons to follow the OOP-dream trying to model the
real world by making use of objects that are pretty much self-responsible for
what they are doing we have to admit that there still are differences between
the real world and the
Java-world.<A HREF = "#footnote6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><A NAME = "backFN6"></A> 
So by now you probably realized that you create your <CITE>classes</CITE>
by means of procedural or structured programming.  In order to get as close
to the OOP-dream as possible, you hide everything other classes don't have 
to know from them and let the instances of your class (the <CITE>objects</CITE>)
simply act as if they were real-world objects.  Once again, it's the idea
of not seeing the forest for all of the trees.  In order to implement your own
<CITE>classes</CITE> you have to view inside and find out what makes the thing
tick.  Once you have your classes up and your objects running, you'll be glad
to take the outside view and simply look at a forest.
</P>

<P>
In order to stick to OOP your object has to create an Error- or
Exception-object.  The fun thing about creating a new Exception-object is
that you can pass it around and get some information about what happend by
using the object's methods.  This will be covered
<A HREF="#object-methods">later</A>.  But first:
</P>

<P>
<A NAME = "more OOP"></A>
<H3>A little more OOP</H3>
</P>

<P>
At this point I still owe you the explanation for the ThrowableObject.  By now 
you already know that Java throws instances of the <EM>Exception</EM>- or 
<EM>Error</EM>-classes.  Both are objects.  Their classes (the templates) 
are <CITE>subclasses</CITE> of the <EM>Throwable</EM>-class.
</P>

<P>
Simply-speaking <EM>subclassing</EM> is a means of saving you the time to copy code
when you have related tasks to do in one program.  If you designed a program
for a matchmaker you'd have to design male- and female objects.  With both
kinds of objects you would want to gather information about the customers
so you would add methods like 
</P>

<HR>

<CODE>
<PRE>
1. <STRONG>void</STRONG> setWeight <STRONG>double</STRONG>  aWeight) { this.weight = aWeight; }
2. <STRONG>void</STRONG> setSize (<STRONG>double</STRONG> aSize) { this.size = aSize; }
3. <STRONG>boolean</STRONG>  isFat () { <STRONG>return</STRONG>  ((weight/size/size) &gt 30d); }
4. <FONT Color = #00ff30>//wildcard for many more methods like the ones above</FONT>
5. <STRONG>void</STRONG> setBeard (<STRONG>boolean</STRONG> hasBeard) { this.beard = hasBeard; }
6. <STRONG>boolean</STRONG> isBearded () { <STRONG>return</STRONG> this.beard; }
7. <STRONG>boolean</STRONG> isPregnant () { <STRONG>return</STRONG> this.sheIsGettingABaby; }
</PRE>
</CODE>

<HR>

<P>
<A NAME = "backFN7"></A>
While there are women around who have beards, so far there haven't been any
male-pregnancies.<A HREF = "#footnote7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>  So you are not coding
males and females but rather some androgynous creatures instead.  In order
to avoid male-pregnancies (especially if they're underaged) you would code 
a <EM>superclass</EM> HumanBeing that holds all the information both male 
and female have in common (there are some I've been told...).  Then you copy
all the code of the HumanBeing-class into a <EM>subclass</EM> you might 
call male and into another one that you might call female.  In OOP this 
copying is done by <CITE>inheritance</CITE>.  In Java you just use the simple
keyword <CODE><STRONG>extends</STRONG></CODE> like this:
</P>

<HR>

<CODE>
<PRE>
1. <STRONG>class</STRONG> male <STRONG>extends</STRONG> HumanBeing {}
</PRE>
</CODE>

<HR>

<P>
... and everybody knows that a male is a HumanBeing.  
</P>

<P>
With Errors and Exceptions it's just the same.  You can throw either one as 
both of them are of the <EM>Throwable</EM>-class.  The following section will
show you, how useful <EM>subclassing</EM> can be.
</P>

<A NAME = "more than one mistake"></A>
<P>
<H3>More than one mistake!</H3>
</P>

<P>
Errors and Exceptions are thrown immediately when they occur so you break out
of any loops and hop out of the <CODE><STRONG>try</CODE></STRONG>-block right
away.  Sometimes bad things happen to good people and more than one Exception
is likely to occur within a single <CODE><STRONG>try</CODE></STRONG>-block.
With Java it is easy to handle that.  Let us assume you would hand two 
String-parameters to your calculate-method - the first one being the operator
and the second one being the String in your TextField (the display).  If you 
didn't initialize your display with a defaultValue (0 works usually best for
calculators) you pass an empty String.  Trying to parse the double-value of 
the empty String you'll get an Exception-object in return.  Have a look at the
code:
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
1. <STRONG>public double</STRONG> calculate (String operator, String rightValue) {
2.   <STRONG>if</STRONG> (operator == "/") {
3.   <FONT COLOR = #00ff30>// this assumes that you already have a dividend-variable leftValue</FONT>
4.   <STRONG>return</STRONG> (leftValue/Double.parseDouble(rightValue));
5.   }
6. }
</PRE>
</CODE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>
You then could run into the danger of dividing anyValue by 0 plus the threat
of an empty String that cannot be parsed.  The latter throws an instance of the
<EM>NumberFormatException-class</EM> (an object) the first one throws an
instance of the <EM>ArithmeticException-class</EM> (another object)!
</P>

<P>
In order to catch more than one Exception, you use the <CODE>catch</CODE>-clause
simply more than once like this:
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
 1. <STRONG>public double</STRONG> calculate (String operator, String rightValue) {
 2.   <STRONG>if</STRONG> (operator == "/") {
 3.     <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
 4.       <STRONG>return</STRONG> (leftValue/Double.parseDouble(rightValue));
 5.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (ArithmeticException ae) {
 6.       System.out.println("You tried to divide by 0");
 7.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (NumberFormatException nfe) {
 8.       System.out.println("Did you try to divide nothing by something?");
 9.     }
10.   }
11. }
</PRE>
</CODE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>
As both Exception-objects are instances of subclasses of the Exception-class it
is just as easy to catch all exceptions at once like this:
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
1. <STRONG>public double</STRONG> calculate (String operator, String rightValue) {
2.   <STRONG>if</STRONG> (operator == "/") {
3.     <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
4.       <STRONG>return</STRONG> (leftValue/Double.parseDouble(rightValue));
5.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (Exception e) {
6.       System.out.println("Please check your input!");
7.     }
8.   }
9. }
</PRE>
</CODE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>
Here you have two objects of the same kind, as the NumberFormatException (which
I previously assigned to the variable nfe) and the ArithmeticException (which
I previously assigned to the variable ae) both are Exceptions.  So no matter
what kind of Exception you have, you can always catch any kind by simply
catching an instance of the Exception-superclass.
</P>

<P>
This is real OOP-power as real-life objects work just the same!  Compare it
to the dresses:  There are many kinds like fancy dresses or shabby dresses. 
In order to go out into the public you better get dressed. Nowadays it doesn't
matter all that much what kind of dress it is you are wearing as long as it
(I love the English language for this:) suits you.
</P>

<P>
You have to be careful, though.  As there are some occasions where it does
matter what kind of dress you're wearing, there will be occasions where it
does matter what kind of Exception is thrown.  It's up to you, to make sense
of your error-handling.  Imagine a password-check that includes a user-name and
a password.  Both the user-name and the password could be checked within one
try-block and each of them might throw its own Exception.  You would not want
a hacker to know where he was going wrong, you would simply catch both
Exceptions and tell the hacker: <CITE>No way Hosé!</CITE>  On the other hand
in the calculator example it would be better to return a 0-value when there was
nothing in the display to divide and to return a warning when someone was
trying to divide by 0 like this:
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
 1. <STRONG>public double</STRONG> calculate (String operator, String rightValue) {
 2.   <STRONG>if</STRONG> (operator == "/") {
 3.     <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
 4.       <STRONG>return</STRONG> (leftValue/Double.parseDouble(rightValue));
 5.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (ArithmeticException ae) {
 6.       System.out.println("You tried to divide by 0, you cannot do this");
 7.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (NumberFormatException nfe) {
 8.       <STRONG>return</STRONG> 0d;
 9.     }
10.   }
11. }
</PRE>
</CODE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>
There is another warning to include here:  If you wanted to make sure your
program at least handled all the Exceptions that are thrown and you knew
that there were two exceptions to be expected, an ArithmeticException and
another one that you didn't know by name, you could easily combine catch one
and catch the rest like this:
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
 1. <STRONG>public double</STRONG> calculate (String operator, String rightValue) {
 2.   <STRONG>if</STRONG> (operator == "/") {
 3.     <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
 4.       <STRONG>return</STRONG> (leftValue/Double.parseDouble(rightValue));
 5.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (ArithmeticException ae) {
 6.       System.out.println("You tried to divide by 0, you cannot do this");
 7.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (Exception e) {
 8.       <STRONG>return</STRONG> 0d;
 9.     }
10.   }
11. }
</PRE>
</CODE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>
If you exchanged the order of the LOC in a way that lines 7 and 8 would precede 
lines 5 and 6 you would never be able to reach your warning-message.  Why?  
Well, once an Exception is thrown, Java goes through the
<CODE>catch</CODE>-clauses one after the other  until it finds the first match.  
Once Java found at least something it will not proceed any further trying to find
the best match. As catching the superclass (Exception) will always match this
has to be the last resort for Exception-handling and follow after the
specialized Exceptions.
</P>

<P>
Once again we can compare it to the dresses:  Catching the superclass is like 
offering a unisex one-size-fits-all dress - there just isn't any need for 
further action once you're dressed even though it would be nicer to have
a special dress of your own.

As I mentioned before, both the <CITE>Error</CITE>- and the
<CITE>Exception</CITE>-class are <CITE>subclasses</CITE> of the
<CITE>Throwable</CITE>-class.  As a matter of fact the <CITE>subclasses</CITE>
do not add any new methods, new attributes or new constructors to the
<CITE>superclass</CITE>.<A HREF = "#footnote8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><A NAME = "backFN8"></A>
</P>

<P>
Now, what would that be good for?  Obviously, the <CITE>superclass</CITE> offers
the functionality for the <CITE>subclasses</CITE> while the <CITE>subclasses</CITE>
simply copy the functionality and that's it!  Well, that's only half of the
truth.  While subclassing does save the tedious task of copying code you have
to remember that OOP means object-talk:  So you also create new templates
(<CITE>classes</CITE>) for different tasks.
</P>

<P>
This enables the Java-programmer to easily distinguish between two different
kinds of errors. The first kind is used for fatal errors and simply called
<STRONG><CITE>Error</CITE></STRONG>.  A fatal error would be one that no
program would try to catch in the sense that your program flow will not be
stopped - imagine the check-up-software of a car:  Once it found out that the
brakes don't work, it wouldn't want anyone to successfully turn the
ignition-key.  It would rather leave you standing there right in the 
middle of nowhere with a simple warning-message (this is what my
operating-system loves doing to me, too - I guess you get the idea!).
</P>

<P>
The second kind of error is called <STRONG><CITE>Exception</CITE></STRONG>.
This kind is used for the kind of error-handling everyone expects:  If you were
running low on gas, you would certainly appreciate a warning-message but you
would also want to drive up to the next gas-station.  If you wanted to open
a file on your disk that doesn't exist and your program got stuck, you'd be
upset.  If instead the program asked you if you wanted to create a new file
by that name you'd live happily everafter.  In other words:  Not handling
Exceptions is a bummer for every user.
</P>


<P><A NAME = "object-methods">
The moment a <CITE>Throwable</CITE>-object (likewise an object of the subclasses)
is thrown the newly created object takes a snapshot of the execution stack of
its thread.  It usually contains a message with a short description of the
error.  The more important methods to obtain information about the
<CITE>Throwable</CITE>-object are implemented in the following LOC that
will help you to understand what kind of information is offered:
</P>

 3.   <STRONG>public static void</STRONG> main (String[] args) {

 5.     <STRONG>int</STRONG> b = 0;
 6.     <STRONG>int</STRONG> noValue = 0;
 7.     <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
 8.       System.out.println(noValue = a/b);
 9.     } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (ArithmeticException ae) {
10.       System.out.println("You got a message: " + ae.getMessage());
11.       System.out.println("This is your object calling: " + ae.toString());
12.       System.out.println("I guess you're stuck: ");

<P>
In the <CODE>catch</CODE>-clause we named the newly created instance of the
<CITE>ArithmeticException</CITE> "ae".  In the following block we simply
accessed the object's methods by <CITE>ae.aMethod()</CITE>.  The above
program can easily be used to get information about Exceptions you do not
exactly know:  Just substitute <CITE>ArithmeticException</CITE> by
<CITE>Exception</CITE> and you'll receive information about any unknown
Exception.  Try that now, it's

Usually it will suffice to use the <CITE>Exception</CITE>-class in order to
do the error-handling you need.  While subclassing the <CITE>Error</CITE>-class
is a no-no simply because you don't throw Errors just for fun and excitement
but rather for serious reasons that will usually lead to the termination of
the program it might be useful to extend the <CITE>Exception</CITE>-class. 
The following example shows you, how to implement a <CITE>BeepingException</CITE>
that doesn't only give you a message but also draws the users attention to your
program by beeping.

<P>
In lines 1 through 13 we created a new class <CITE>BeepingException</CITE> by
extending the <CITE>Exception</CITE>-class.  The two constructors use the
constructors of the superclass (this is easily done with the keyword
<CITE>super</CITE>) to create a new instance of the class (actually the
<CITE>Exception</CITE>-class simply passes the buck to the
<CITE>Throwable</CITE>-class and let the latter do the work).  The new class
inherits all the fancy features that the <CITE>Exception</CITE>-class has to
offer and simply adds an attribute (line 2) and two method-calls (lines 6 and
11) to it.
</P>

<P>
The <CITE>attribute</CITE> is simply a connection to your system's resources
that we assigned to the variable <CITE>beeper</CITE>.  Since most systems
provide for somekind of beep, we can simply call the <CITE>beep</CITE>-method
that is provided in the <CITE>Toolkit</CITE>-class.  Inserting the method-call
in both constructors let's the user hear a beep when the
<CITE>BeepingException</CITE>-object is created or in other words: when the
Exception is thrown.
</P>

<P>
Lines 15 through 19 add a class with a main-method to test the newly created
class.<A HREF = "#footnote10"><SUP>10</SUP></A><A NAME = "backFN10"></A>  It
includes a new keyword that wasn't mentioned so far: 
<STRONG><CODE>throws</CODE></STRONG>.  Browsing through the code you
might have realized that we didn't catch anything.  This is where
<CODE>throws</CODE> comes in.  It's simply putting your cards on the table:  If
you do not offer a solution for the Error-handling within your method you have
to admit it right away so that everyone else can see what will happen.
</P>

<P>
While in the above example <CODE>throws</CODE> is used in a dirty way since I
didn't provide any Error-handling at all, the keyword is your way to writing
robust code that can be used more than once.  The concept behind it is once
again OOP.  If you have objects that know what might go wrong, they are easily
reusable in a totally different context.  So instead of forging a certain
way to handle an Error once and for all that might not be a perfect fit every
time, you let the programmer decide what he wants his program to do when an
Error occurs.  Just remember what we did with the
<CITE>NumberFormatException</CITE> in our calculator-example:  We simply
returned the value of 0 which is ok for a calculator.  Talking about the
plane's steering-software it just might not be ok...
</P>

<P><A NAME = "Finally"></A>
<H3>Finally - wrapping things up!</H3>
</P>

<P>
One last example:  Imagine a password-check that throws an <CITE>Exception</CITE>
in case the password was wrong.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to log all attempts
to access your system no matter if they were successful or not?  I sure think
so and the Java-developers thought so, too.
</P>

<P>
Actually, the programming task could be achieved quite easily by writing a
log-method that was called from within the <CODE>try</CODE>-block and from
within each and every <CODE>catch</CODE>-block, too.  Once again that sounds
like tedious work so Java provides a simple means for handling these situations:
The <CODE>finally</CODE>-block.  Everything that's coded within the
<CODE>finally</CODE>-block will be executed no matter if an Exception was
thrown or not.  The following LOC shows the idea.  Don't be disappointed as I
didn't include any code for the methods - Java security is a different ballgame.
</P>
<P></P>

<HR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
 1. <STRONG>try</STRONG> {
 2.   checkUserName(userName);
 3.   checkPassword(password);
 4. } <STRONG>catch</STRONG> (Exception e) {
 5.   attempts++;
 6.   System.out.println("That's not right");
 7.   <STRONG>if</STRONG> ((attempts % 3) == 0) {
 8.     System.out.println("This was it!");
 9.     callThePolice();
10.   }
11. } <STRONG>finally</STRONG> {
12.   logAttempt(userName, password);
13. }
</PRE>
</CODE>

<HR>

<P>
The program checks the password and the username and assumes that both
throw an Exception of their own.  Either one of these Exceptions is caught
in the <CODE>catch</CODE>-block that tells the user that he didn't enter
the right userName <STRONG>or</STRONG> password.  An integer-variable is
counting the number of attempts.  You should have found out that you only
have three attempts!<A HREF = "#footnote11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><A NAME = "backFN11"></A>  
If the third one was wrong, too, the program calls the police and logs the
third attempt.
</P>

<P>
There is just a single case when this does not work:  If you included a line
like <CODE>System.exit(-1);</CODE> in one of your <CODE>catch</CODE>-blocks
and this block was executed you're forcing your program to exit and it will
obey - the <CODE>finally</CODE>-block will then never be executed.  
</P>

<P>
Well, this pretty much wraps it up.  By now I hope you have a decent understanding of
the whys and hows of error-handling and Java's object-oriented approach to it. 
Once you start writing larger programs there will still be a couple things left
to discover (e.g. nesting <CODE>try</CODE>-blocks, program-flow, ...) but as I
realize that this tutorial already exceeds a 10-minutes read I do not want to
overdo it - so go ahead and make some errors of your own ...
