AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the role of the vitreous in idiopathic    macular
hole formation. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the    vitreous before and
during vitreous surgery in 64 consecutive    eyes of 62 patients (stage 1B,
four eyes; stage 2, ten eyes;    stage 3, 43 eyes; stage 4, four eyes) with
macular holes; another    three eyes underwent a second vitrectomy. After core
vitrectomy,    the premacular vitreous cortex was examined by applying gentle
suction. The detached posterior hyaloid face was observed under
endoilluminiation. RESULTS: We observed in all eyes a liquefied    lacuna
anterior to the posterior fundus before and during    vitreous surgery. The
premacular vitreous cortex was extremely    thin and elastic upon gentle
suction. A premacular ring, the    diameter two to four times that of the Weiss
ring, was observed    in 48 of 57 eyes (84%) with stages 1B, 2, and 3 macular
hole. In    most cases, the vitreous cortex within the premacular ring either
was absent or had a break, resulting in a premacular round    defect. The
vitreous cortex peripheral to the premacular ring,    which was thick and less
deformed, never showed a break. In eyes    that had undergone a second
vitrectomy, we noted residual cortex    or an epiretinal membrane around the
macular hole. CONCLUSIONS:    The premacular vitreous cortex is extremely thin
and elastic. It    is sharply demarcated by a ring from the thick peripheral
vitreous cortex. Tangential traction, which causes macular holes,    appears to
originate exclusively in the premacular vitreous    cortex that forms the
posterior wall of the premacular liquefied    pocket.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the advantages, disadvantages, safety,
complications, and surgical applicability of an erbium:YAG laser    system for
maneuvers in vitreoretinal surgery. METHODS: A    prospective, consecutive
trial of 68 eyes in 66 patients    undergoing vitreoretinal surgery in which an
erbium:YAG laser    with graduated output from 0.2 to 5.0 mJ per pulse,
repetition    rate of 2 to 30 Hz, and equipped with a flexible fiber optic and
 interchangeable 20-gauge intraocular fiber optic endoprobes was    used to
perform specific maneuvers, including transection,    incision, and ablation of
membranes, retinotomy, vessel    coagulation, iridectomy, and lens tissue
ablation. The patients    were treated in five centers in contemporary
vitreoretinal    surgical settings for surgical indications, including
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative    vitreoretinopathy,
epiretinal membrane, and retinopathy of    prematurity. RESULTS: One hundred
seventy-four maneuvers were    performed with an overall surgical efficacy
rating of excellent    or good in 84% of maneuvers, ranging from a high of 100%
for    subretinal membrane transection to a low of 25% for coagulation    of
blood vessels. Complications included retinal break or    photocoagulative
injury in 5% of epiretinal membrane incisions,    minor bleeding from
transected retinal vessels during 29% of    retinotomies, and intraocular lens
damage during two posterior    capsulotomies. The most significant limitation
was the cautious    pace used during maneuvers near the retinal surface.
CONCLUSION:    The erbium:YAG laser is capable of versatile new approaches
offering precise tissue cutting and ablation in vitreoretinal    surgical
maneuvers with a high degree of safety. The main    limitation encountered was
the slow speed of certain critical    maneuvers near the retina.<p>

interleukin-1-induced cellular inflammation and vascular    permeability in the
rabbit retina.<p>
AD  - Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University,    New
Haven, CT 06520, USA.<p>
AB  - Intra-vitreal injection of 300 U of interleukin (IL)-1 beta into    the
rabbit eye induces an inflammation of the retina    characterized by
hemorrhage, monocyte and neutrophil    infiltration, and an increase in
vascular permeability that peaks    24 h post-injection. Since the epiretinal
vessels involved in    this inflammation form part of the blood-retina barrier,
we used    this model to investigate the effects of the immunosuppressive
cytokine TGF beta 1 on inflammation within the context of the    central
nervous system. We found that intra-vitreal injection of    1 microgram rh TGF
beta administered concomitantly with rh IL-1    beta significantly reduced IL-1
beta-induced hemorrhage by 78%,    and monocyte and neutrophil infiltration by
53% and 62%,    respectively. In contrast, TGF beta did not reduce the IL-1
beta-induced increase in vascular permeability. However, TGF beta    by itself
caused a statistically significant increase in serum    proteins in perfused
tissues of the eye, to give a 3.1 +/- 0.4    fold increase in protein content
over control values. No cellular    inflammation accompanied this alteration in
vascular    permeability. These data indicate that whereas the local
administration of TGF beta may be an effective inhibitor of    cellular
inflammation in the CNS, the effects on alterations in    vascular permeability
and accumulation of serum proteins may be    more complex.<p>

AD  - St John Ophthalmic Hospital, Jerusalem.<p>
AB  - 'En bloc' dissection is a technique in which epiretinal membranes
(ERM) are separated from the retina as a single lamina with a    20-gauge blunt
flute needle. We used this technique to remove    epimacular membranes of
various aetiologies in a consecutive    series of 25 eyes, with a minimum
follow-up of 5 months (mean    10.4 months). Small residual epicentres of ERM
away from the    fovea remained in 7 (29.1%) eyes only; 3 were inside and 4
outside the temporal vascular arcades. Postoperatively 64%    (16/25) of
patients achieved a final visual acuity of 6/12 or    better and 76% (19/25)
achieved a final visual acuity of 6/18 or    better. Progressive lens opacities
were the most important    postoperative complication in phakic eyes that
significantly    affected the visual results. This technique successfully
removed    epimacular membranes over a wide area, without the need to find a
starting edge or the use of sharp instruments near the retina.    Diaphanous
ERMs with ill-defined borders and tenaciously adherent    membranes could be
removed with minimal trauma to the underlying    retina. Histopathological and
immunohistochemical examination of    10 ERMs demonstrated the absence of
internal limiting lamina in 6    (60%).<p>

TI  - Apoptotic cell death in proliferative vitreoretinopathy.<p>

Germany. peter.esser@uni-koeln.de<p>
AB  - Apoptosis is a selective event of physiological cell deletion    that
plays a crucial role in the development of numerous tissues,    including the
retina. In this paper we report the occurrence of    apoptosis in epiretinal
membranes derived from patients with    proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).
Detection of apoptosis was    performed by an in situ DNA-end labeling
technique using terminal    transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate
(dUTP)    incorporation. Apoptotic nuclei exhibiting chromatin condensation
and fragmentation were also identified by acridine orange    fluorescence.
Apoptosis was detected in varying numbers of cells.    The typical appearance
of apoptotic nuclei, including nuclear    chromatin condensation, was detected
scattered inhomogeneously    throughout the epiretinal membranes, in clusters,
or even in    single cells. Induction of apoptosis in human retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE) cells by daunomycin could be demonstrated by in    situ DNA
end labeling and by quantitative determination of    cytoplasmatic
histone-associated DNA fragments using a    photometric enzyme immunoassay.
Since apoptosis has been shown to    be an important factor in the growth
control of various    untransformed and neoplastic cell populations, the
pharmacological induction of apoptosis in epiretinal membranes    could result
in a new approach toward inhibiting cellular    proliferation in PVR.<p>

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is now known to be more than    one
disease. NF2, formerly classified as central    neurofibromatosis, is
characterized by bilateral vestibular    schwannomas, previously termed
"acoustic neuromas", and is much    less common than NF1. Lens opacities at an
early age have been    described in approximately 85% of NF2 patients. PURPOSE:
To    determine the frequency of retinal abnormalities in NF2 patients.
METHODS: We prospectively examined 15 consecutive patients who    met the
diagnostic criteria of NF2. RESULTS: We observed an    epiretinal membrane in
the macular or paramacular area in 12 of    15 patients, and a combined pigment
epithelial and retinal    hamartoma in the macula of one patient who also had
an epiretinal    membrane in the macula of the other eye. Additionally, 11
patients had central posterior cortical, subcapsular, or    peripheral cortical
lens opacities. CONCLUSIONS: Children or    young patients with epiretinal
membranes, combined pigment    epithelial retinal hamartoma, and lens opacities
that are not the    result of other ocular disorders should have a neurologic
evaluation and a careful family history for NF2.<p>

AB  - Two eyes with a complicated retinal detachment were operated    using
intraocular silicone oil injection. They were enucleated 33    and 12 months
after the operation because of painful secondary    glaucoma and corneal
dystrophy. Using light and electron    microscopy, silicone oil vacuoles were
observed in the corneal    depth, the iris stroma, the trabecular meshwork and
in lens    remnants. There was an angle closure due to iridocorneal
synechia. The same vacuoles were recognized in epiretinal    membranes, in the
internal and external layers of the retina and    in the pigment epithelium.
When the retina was detached, silicone    oil vacuoles were present in the
choroidal vessels.<p>

AB  - Modern surgery of the macula exists since 1965, and was initially
proposed in membrane removal from patients presenting an    idiopathic
epiretinal membrane. This first indication authorized    the development of
macular microsurgical instrumentation and    further analysis of membrane
fragments. However, the exact    pathogenesis of these membranes remains yet
unknown. Since 1991    macular surgery was applied in the treatment of macular
holes.    Results obtained after macular hole surgery confirmed pathogenic
hypothesis observed clinically by Gas. Considerable improvement    was
therefore achieved in anatomical and functional outcome.    Chorioretinal
adhesion agents were recently proposed to optimize    the closure of macular
holes. Submacular surgery is the latest    technologic achievement under
investigation. The ultimate    indications are age-related macular
degeneration, first cause of    blindness in industrialized countries. Retinal
transplantation    opens new avenues in the treatment of a large number of
chorioretinal diseases. The assessment of macular surgery could    pave the way
in realising such technical advances.<p>

TI  - Macular edema in chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.<p>
AD  - Doheny Eye Institute, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macular edema is relatively rare in the
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, in contrast to many other    syndromes of
chronic intraocular inflammation, in which macular    edema is relatively
common. Five eyes of three patients with    chronic VKH syndrome and macular
edema are described. METHODS:    The authors retrospectively reviewed the
clinical and fluorescein    angiographic records of 27 patients with chronic
VKH syndrome    (duration of disease more than 3 months) and identified three
patients (five eyes) who had macular edema. Fluorescein    angiography was
performed using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope.    RESULTS: These patients had
either unusually severe and    protracted inflammation (3 eyes) of the presence
of an epiretinal    membrane (2 eyes). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated
prominent    perifoveal fluorescein leakage with pooling of fluorescein within
 perifoveal cystoid spaces. Treatment with sub-Tenon's    triamcinolone
injections resulted in improvement of visual acuity    by two or more Snellen
lines in four of the five eyes.    CONCLUSION: Macular edema is an uncommon but
treatable cause of    late loss of vision in patients with the VKH syndrome,
and may be    the result of leakage from perifoveal retinal capillaries or
leakage of fluid at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.<p>

are present in epiretinal and choroidal neovascular    membranes.<p>
AD  - Kresge Eye Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine,
Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether vascular endothelial growth factor    and
basic fibroblast growth factor, which may be critical    mitogens for
neovascularization, are present together in human    retinal and choroidal
neovascular membranes. METHODS: Light    microscopic immunocytochemistry using
antibodies against vascular    endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast
growth factor, and    several cellular "marker" proteins on frozen sections
from three    choroidal neovascular membranes from patients with age-related
macular degeneration, seven surgically excised epiretinal    membranes from
patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy,    and six epiretinal
membranes from patients with nonischemic    proliferative retinopathies.
RESULTS: All three choroidal    neovascular membranes and all seven epiretinal
membranes stained    positive for vascular endothelial growth factor. Two
choroidal    neovascular membranes and six of the epiretinal membranes were
positive for basic fibroblast growth factor. The same cells were    often
positive for both antigens. None of the epiretinal    membranes from patients
with nonischemic proliferative    retinopathies were positive for either growth
factor. Many of the    cells that demonstrated growth factors were glial cells,
vascular    endothelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Colocalization of two growth factors in the same    cells of
ocular neovascular membranes suggests that more than one    growth factor may
contribute to pathologic angiogenesis. Growth    factors in neovascular tissues
are not localized exclusively in    the vascular endothelium. Because
expression of some growth    factors is stimulated by hypoxia, their
localization within    choroidal neovascular membranes suggests that hypoxia
may be an    etiologic factor for choroidal as well as for retinal
neovascularization.<p>

Paris.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: The predictability of the measurement of the macular
function by white light interferometry was evaluated in a group    of patients
whose epiretinal membranes had been surgically    removed. METHOD: Fifteen
patients presenting either primitive or    secondary epiretinal membranes were
included. We used the    apparatus described by W. Lotmar. The main evaluation
criteria    was the best corrected visual acuity (VA) chosen between the
third month and the sixth month examinations. RESULTS:    Preoperatively the
mean visual acuity was 0.227 +/- 0.105. The    mean final visual acuity was
0.507 +/- 0.198. The final visual    acuity was predicted within an 0.1
interval in ten cases (67%).    In two cases the predicted visual acuity was
identical to the    pre-operative VA and the final results confirmed the test.
No    improvement occurred. CONCLUSION: The Lotmar visometer is
statistically predictive of the visual outcome after epi-retinal    membranes
surgery.<p>

TI  - Distribution of TNF alpha and its reactive vascular adhesion    molecules
in fibrovascular membranes of proliferative diabetic    retinopathy.<p>
AD  - Department of Immunology, St Thomas's Hospital, London.<p>
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the presence of the cytokine tumour
necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and the vascular adhesion    glycoproteins
ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, and PECAM    within fibrovascular
membranes of eyes with proliferative    diabetic retinopathy (PDR). METHODS:
The presence of these    molecules was determined by immunohistochemical
staining using    monoclonal antibodies and the APAAP technique. RESULTS:
Staining    for TNF alpha was observed on the retinal vascular endothelium of
five of 12 specimens, on infiltrating cells within all membranes,    and on the
extracellular matrix of nine specimens. This staining    wa abolished by
absorption of the monoclonal antibody with human    recombinant TNF alpha.
Likewise, ICAM-1 staining was given by    infiltrating cells and extracellular
matrix of nine membranes and    by the endothelium of three of the specimens.
VCAM-1, E-selectin,    and P-selectin staining was observed on the vascular
endothelium    of 5/12, 4/12, and 3/12 epiretinal membranes respectively. PECAM
  was expressed by the endothelium of 4/12 specimens, by    infiltrating cells
of 8/12 membranes, and also by the    extracellular matrix of two of the
specimens. CONCLUSION: The    widespread distribution of TNF alpha and the
nature of the    adhesion molecules expressed by vascular endothelial cells in
PDR    membranes suggest that local activation of TNF alpha and enhanced
expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules may play an    important role in
the development of the proliferative phase of    diabetic retinopathy.<p>

AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Auckland Hospital, New Zealand.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective study was undertaken to review the
clinical signs and management of patients with perforating eye    injuries
associated with regional anaesthesia for ophthalmic    surgery. METHODS:
Fifteen consecutive patients presenting with    inadvertent perforation of the
globe were evaluated. Eleven    required vitreoretinal surgery. The indications
were retinal    detachment (six eyes), vitreous haemorrhage (four) and an
epiretinal membrane (one eye). RESULTS: Those eyes with retinal    detachments
generally had a poor functional outcome in spite of    the retinae being
attached in five of the six eyes. The operative    findings of those eyes with
vitreous haemorrhage but attached    retina demonstrated varying retinal tear
configurations.    CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with perforating injuries following
intraorbital anaesthesia are at risk of developing a retinal    detachment. In
those eyes presenting with dense vitreous but    attached retina, consideration
of vitrectomy and laser    photocoagulation is advised.<p>

TI  - Germ-line mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 gene: correlations    with
disease severity and retinal abnormalities.<p>
AD  - Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,    MD
20892-7360, USA.<p>
AB  - Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) features bilateral vestibular    schwannomas,
other benign neural tumors, and cataracts. Patients    in some families develop
many tumors at an early age and have    rapid clinical progression, whereas in
other families, patients    may not have symptoms until much later and
vestibular schwannomas    may be the only tumors. The NF2 gene has been cloned
from    chromosome 22q; most identified germ-line mutations result in a
truncated protein and severe NF2. To look for additional    mutations and
clinical correlations, we used SSCP analysis to    screen DNA from 32 unrelated
patients. We identified 20 different    mutations in 21 patients (66%): 10
nonsense mutations, 2    frameshifts, 7 splice-site mutations, and 1 large
in-frame    deletion. Clinical information on 47 patients from the 21
families included ages at onset and at diagnosis, numbers of    meningiomas,
spinal and skin tumors, and presence of cataracts    and retinal abnormalities.
We compared clinical findings in    patients with nonsense or frameshift
mutations to those with    splice-site mutations. When each patient was
considered as an    independent random event, the two groups differed (P &lt;
or = .05)    for nearly every variable. Patients with nonsense or frameshift
mutations were younger at onset and at diagnosis and had a higher    frequency
and mean number of tumors, supporting the correlation    between nonsense and
frameshift mutations and severe NF2. When    each family was considered as an
independent random event,    statistically significant differences between the
two groups were    observed only for mean ages at onset and at diagnosis. A
larger    data set is needed to resolve these discrepancies. We observed
retinal hamartomas and/or epiretinal membranes in nine patients    from five
families with four different nonsense mutations. This    finding, which may
represent a new genotype-phenotype    correlation, merits further study.<p>

TI  - Silicone oil's properties make it a versatile tool for vit/ret
surgery.<p>
AB  - Silicone oil initially was perceived as a surgical tool to    separate
proliferative tissue from the retinal surface. The role    of silicone oil as
an intraocular tamponade became more clearly    established following the
introduction of trans pars plana    vitrectomy in 1970 and the significant
subsequent refinements in    surgical techniques and technology. Silicone oil
maintains an    important place in the vitreoretinal surgical armamentarium. It
  may help preserve sight in some otherwise inoperable eyes. Future    research
may utilize silicone oil as a reservoir for the slow    release of a
therapeutic concentration of lipophilic drugs that    inhibit viral retinitis
or the proliferation of epiretinal    membranes.<p>

AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Bundesknappschaft's Hospital,
Sulzbach/Saar, Germany.<p></A>
AB  - AIMS/BACKGROUND: This study was performed to identify factors
predictive for recurrence of idiopathic and secondary epiretinal    membranes
after vitrectomy. Long term visual outcome was    determined and compared with
eyes without recurrence of    epiretinal tissue. METHODS: Out of 350
consecutive cases    vitrectomised for removal of epiretinal macular membranes,
42    patients (42 eyes) with recurrence of epiretinal membranes were
re-examined and their records reviewed. Recurrence of epiretinal    membranes
was determined by new appearance of epiretinal tissue    or abnormal sheen of
the central retina. The preoperative    findings, best postoperative and final
visual acuity of these    patients were compared with a comparable cohort of
eyes without    recurrence after removal of macular pucker (131 eyes). The
eligibility criterion was a follow up of at least 6 months.    RESULTS: The
best postoperative (0.46 (SD 0.24)) and the final    visual acuity (0.39
(0.26)) of eyes with recurrent membranes (42    eyes) was statistically better
than preoperative vision (0.27    (0.22)) (p = 0.0003 and 0.0089). Because of
reduced or distorted    vision eight of the 42 eyes underwent a revitrectomy
during the    follow up (mean 23 months). Best postoperative visual acuity
(0.50 (0.21)) and final visual acuity (0.47 (0.25)) of eyes which    received a
second vitrectomy (n = 8) were not statistically    different from the 32 eyes
with recurrence of epiretinal tissue    but without revitrectomy (p = 0.253 and
0.343). In addition, eyes    with recurrence showed no different visual outcome
compared with    eyes without recurrence of epiretinal membranes after
vitrectomy    (p = 0.84). Recurrence of epiretinal membranes was correlated
with neither the type of membrane (thick or thin) nor incomplete    membrane
removal during pars plana vitrectomy. CONCLUSION: This    study demonstrates
the overall favourable visual prognosis of    patients with vitrectomy for
macular pucker, even with recurrence    of the premacular membrane.<p>

TI  - Ultrastructural features of tissue removed during idiopathic    macular
hole surgery.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Emory University School of Medicine,
Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. ophtheg@emory.edu<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the ultrastructural features of excised    tissue
removed during surgery for idiopathic macular holes with    the preoperative
stage of the macular hole. METHODS: Twelve    consecutive patients with a
unilateral idiopathic macular hole    underwent vitrectomy with surgical
removal of the internal    limiting membrane of the retina and epiretinal
tissue overlying    and surrounding the hole. The excised specimens were
evaluated    with transmission electron microscopy, and findings were compared
 with the preoperative stage of the macular hole according to the
classification of Gass. RESULTS: Surgery was performed on 12 eyes    of 12
patients with stage 2, 3, or 4 macular holes. Internal    limiting membrane was
present in 11 of 12 specimens. Tissue from    one of two eyes with stage 2
holes showed cellular elements    enmeshed in cortical vitreous. Tissue from
four of seven eyes    with stage 3 holes and three of three eyes with stage 4
holes had    cellular proliferation on the internal limiting membrane. Cells
with myofibroblastic differentiation were present in five of the    eight
cellular proliferations. CONCLUSION: Our results support    the clinical stages
of idiopathic macular holes described by    Gass. Idiopathic macular holes
appear to form from contraction of    the prefoveal vitreous, and the hole
enlarges because of    contraction of myofibroblasts on the inner surface of
the    internal limiting membrane. On the basis of the mechanical    mechanisms
of idiopathic macular hole formation, removal of the    internal limiting
membrane and adherent epiretinal tissue    surrounding and overlying the
macular hole is a reasonable    surgical approach to close idiopathic macular
holes.<p>

reported. Causes for juvenile epiretinal membranes, including    trauma, pars
planitis, toxocariasis, Coats' disease, or combined    hamartomas, were not
present. Both patients previously had    documented normal vision in the

  improved from counting fingers at 5 feet to 20/80. The    12-year-old boy's
vision improved from 20/200 to 20/80. Selected    cases of juvenile epiretinal

TI  - Hyalocytes synthesize and secrete inhibitors of retinal pigment
epithelial cell proliferation in vitro.<p>
AD  - Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital,    Baltimore,
Md, USA.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that enter the
vitreous in pathologic conditions, such as retinal detachment,    may
proliferate and contribute to the formation of epiretinal    membranes.
OBJECTIVE: To study whether hyalocytes, endogenous    vitreous cells, play a
role in modulating the proliferation of    RPE cells. METHODS: Cell
proliferation was measured by tritiated    thymidine incorporation in
density-arrested human RPE cells after    incubation with media that had been
conditioned by cultured    bovine hyalocytes. Preliminary characterization of
inhibitory    activity in hyalocyte-conditioned medium was performed, including
  blocking experiments with a neutralizing antibody to transforming    growth
factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta) and proliferation assays that    used MV-1-Lu mink
lung epithelial cells. Northern blots were done    to asses hyalocyte
expression of TGF-beta messenger RNA. RESULTS:    Hyalocyte-conditioned medium
inhibited tritiated thymidine    incorporation in RPE cells and MV-1-Lu mink
lung epithelial cells    in the presence or absence of serum or protease
inhibitors. A    portion of the inhibitory activity was neutralized by an
antibody    directed against TGF-beta. Northern blots of hyalocyte RNA
demonstrated the presence of messenger RNA for TGF-beta 2. These    data
suggest that TGF-beta is responsible for a portion of the    inhibitory
activity secreted by hyalocytes. Additional inhibitory    activity is
attributable to one or more low-molecular-weight    molecules distinct from
TGF-beta. CONCLUSIONS:    Hyalocyte-conditioned medium inhibits RPE cell
proliferation in    vitro through TGF-beta and at least one other molecule.
Production of these factors by hyalocytes in vivo could provide a    deterrent
for epiretinal membrane formation that may be perturbed    under pathologic
conditions.<p>

TI  - Imaging of epiretinal membranes in macular holes by scanning    laser
ophthalmoscopy.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Asahikawa Medical College, Japan.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: Because recognition and removal of an epiretinal    membrane are
important in macular hole surgery, we used the    scanning laser ophthalmoscope
preoperatively to study epiretinal    membranes in patients with idiopathic
macular holes. METHODS: We    studied 67 eyes (60 consecutive patients) with
idiopathic macular    holes. We evaluated the thickness and the extent of the
epiretinal membrane by using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. We    then
compared the fundus images obtained with the scanning laser    ophthalmoscope
with red-free monochromatic fundus photographs.    RESULTS: Confocal imaging of
the fundus with either argon blue    (488 nm) or argon green (514 nm) laser
illumination clearly    showed the epiretinal membranes. In all eyes, we
observed lesions    ranging from a patchy glinting light reflex to a dense
epiretinal    membrane. A well-demarcated dense epiretinal membrane around the
 macular hole was observed in seven (44%) of 16 eyes with stage 2    macular
holes and in 12 (40%) of 30 eyes with stage 3 holes, but    in only two (10%)
of 21 eyes with stage 4 holes. The prevalence    of the dense epiretinal
membrane in stage 2 or 3 holes was    significantly higher than in stage 4
holes (P = .025 and .024,    respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Fundus imaging using
the scanning    laser ophthalmoscope with argon laser illumination is useful
preoperatively to evaluate epiretinal membranes in eyes with    idiopathic
macular holes.<p>

TI  - Visual field loss following vitreous surgery.<p>
AD  - Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute, Baltimore, Md., USA.<p>
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess possible causes of visual field loss    following
vitreous surgery. DESIGN: Charts of 8 patients    prospectively identified, who
developed visual field loss    following vitreous surgery, were reviewed to
characterize this    newly recognized syndrome and assess possible causes.
RESULTS:    Two patients had preexisting chronic open-angle glaucoma and 1
had ocular hypertension. Indications for surgery included 4 eyes    with
macular holes, 1 eye with epiretinal membrane, 2 eyes with    rhegmatogenous
retinal detachment, and 1 eye with retinal    detachment and giant retinal
tear. All patients received    retrobulbar anesthesia. Seven of 8 patients had
fluid/gas    exchange with installation of long-acting bubbles. In 1 patient
with a macular hole, a small hemorrhage was noted along a vessel    coming off
the nerve superotemporally while attempting to engage    the posterior cortical
vitreous intraoperatively. This patient    developed an inferior visual field
defect. No intraocular    pressure (IOP) measurements greater than 26 mm Hg
were recorded    in any eye perioperatively. Visual field defects included 4
eyes    with inferotemporal defects, 2 eyes with inferior altitudinal
defects, 1 eye with a cecocentral scotoma, and 1 eye with a    superonasal
defect. Only 1 patient had worsened visual acuity. A    relative afferent
pupillary defect was observed in 4 eyes and    disc pallor in 5 eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Central or peripheral visual    field loss can now be recognized
as a possible complication of    vitreous surgery. In some cases, a relative
afferent pupillary    defect and optic disc pallor are present, suggesting that
the    optic nerve is the site of injury. Possible mechanisms include
ischemia due to elevated IOP or fluctuations in IOP, optic nerve    damage from
retrobulbar injection, direct intraoperative    mechanical trauma to the optic
nerve, indirect injury from    vigorous suction near the optic nerve leading to
shearing of    peripapillary axons or vessels, or a combination of these.
Certain optic nerves may be more susceptible to injury because of
preexisting compromise from glaucoma or vascular disease.<p>

Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: We tested the efficacy of an erbium:YAG laser for    maneuvers
in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery. METHODS:    An erbium:YAG laser
equipped with a flexible fiberoptic and    interchangeable 20-gauge endoprobes
of various tip configurations    ranging from 100 to 365 microns was used for
specific maneuvers    in 13 patients referred for vitreoretinal surgery for
diabetic    traction detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinal
detachment with posterior break, and epimacular membrane. The    following
maneuvers were performed: (1) transection of elevated    vitreous membranes,
(2) incision of epiretinal membranes, (3)    drainage and relaxing retinotomy,
(4) transection of subretinal    membranes, (5) noncontact ablation of
epiretinal membranes in    air-filled eyes, (6) ablation of lens remnants, (7)
posterior    capsulotomy, (8) iris surgery, and (9) retinal vascular
coagulation. RESULTS: Forty-eight defined maneuvers were    performed with
energy levels ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 mJ and    repetition rates of 2 to 30 Hz.
Transection of elevated    membranes, subretinal membranes, and retinotomies
were easily    performed. Fourteen incisions into vascularized epiretinal
membranes in diabetic traction detachment surgery demonstrated a    fine margin
of coagulation that permitted hemostatic incision.    Retinal breaks were
created during one of these incisions. Lens    remnant ablation, posterior
capsulotomy, and iris tissue removal    were successful, with a single
complication consisting of damage    to the posterior surface of an intraocular
lens during a pars    plana posterior capsulotomy accomplished by means of a
side-firing probe. Epiretinal membrane ablations in air-filled    eyes were
effectively performed in a gradual fashion without    hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS:
The erbium:YAG laser offers precise and    effective tissue cutting and removal
in vitreoretinal maneuvers.    Further study will determine the role of this
technology in    vitreoretinal surgery.<p>

TI  - Vitrectomy for diabetic macular edema associated with a thickened    and
taut posterior hyaloid membrane.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of Miami School of    Medicine,
Florida, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the surgical results in a series of patients    with
diabetic macular edema associated with traction from a    thickened and taut
posterior hyaloid membrane and to identify    features associated with better
visual outcome. METHODS: We    reviewed the clinical records of ten consecutive
patients who    underwent pars plana vitrectomy in one eye for diabetic macular
  edema that was preoperatively attributed to thickening and    traction of the
posterior hyaloid membrane. RESULTS:    Best-corrected, preoperative visual
acuity was 20/200 in seven    eyes, 20/300 in one eye, and 20/400 in two eyes.
 Intraoperatively, seven patients were found to have an attached    posterior
hyaloid membrane which was thickened and taut. Among    these seven patients,
postoperative best-corrected visual acuity    improved by six lines in two
eyes, by five lines in one eye, by    two lines in one eye, and remained within
one line of    preoperative visual acuity in three eyes. The other three
patients had an epiretinal membrane simulating an attached and    thickened
posterior hyaloid membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy    effectively improved
visual acuity in some eyes with diabetic    macular edema associated with
traction from a thickened and taut    posterior hyaloid membrane. Despite
careful preoperative    examination with a fundus contact lens, however, in
some patients    it may be difficult to assess how the posterior hyaloid
membrane    contributes to the macular edema. In selected patients, early
surgical intervention may be associated with better visual    outcome.<p>

activator and perfluorocarbon liquid.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Osaka University Medical School,
Yamadaoka, Japan.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the result of surgical removal of submacular
hemorrhage by using tissue plasminogen activator and    perfluorocarbon liquid.
METHODS: In 22 consecutive patients (22    eyes), subretinal hemorrhage
associated with age-related macular    degeneration, which involved the fovea
and completely obscured    the choroidal vascular pattern, was treated by pars
plana    vitrectomy. The hemorrhages were liquefied with tissue    plasminogen
activator, squeezed into the vitreous cavity with    perfluorocarbon liquid,
and then evacuated. RESULTS: Efficacy of    the procedure was judged by the
best postoperative corrected    visual acuity, which was 20/100 or better in 16
eyes (73%).    Submacular hemorrhage recurred in four (18%) eyes, epiretinal
membrane formed in three (14%) eyes, and retinal detachment    occurred in
three (14%) eyes. Best-corrected final visual acuity    was improved
postoperatively in 18 (82%) of the 22 eyes,    unchanged in three (14%) eyes,
and decreased in one (5%) eye,    final visual acuity was 20/200 or better in
15 eyes (68%) and    limited in other eyes by subretinal hemorrhage of greater
than 30    days' duration or subfoveal neovascularizations. CONCLUSIONS: Use
of tissue plasminogen activator and perfluorocarbon liquid in    surgical
removal of submacular hemorrhage may improve the outcome    of surgery by
reducing surgically induced retinal damage.<p>

AD  - Retina Research Fund, St. Mary's Medical Center, San Francisco,    CA
94109, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: Peripheral angiomas have been associated with epiretinal
membranes and traction retinal detachment. The authors    investigated the
timing, results, and complications of vitreous    surgery to remove the retinal
traction and treat the peripheral    vascular tumor. METHODS: The authors
reviewed the results of ten    eyes that had undergone vitrectomy for macular
pucker and/or    traction retinal detachment. These eyes had either
preoperative    or intraoperative treatment of the peripheral tumor. RESULTS:
Patients were followed 4 to 95 months. Six eyes had nonfamilial    peripheral
acquired retinal hemangioma, three had von Hippel    angiomas, and one had
multiple large peripheral retinal angiomas    associated with extensive retinal
telangiectasis. Four eyes    received cryotherapy and/or laser photocoagulation
2 to 3 months    before surgery. In the remaining six eyes, initial treatment
to    the peripheral angioma was performed at the time of vitreous    surgery.
At final follow-up, all eyes were attached without    retinal traction. Vision
improved in all eyes; six (60%) achieved    20/50 or better visual acuity.
Complications included recurrent    epiretinal membrane (n=3); nonregressed
angiomas (n=3); increased    nuclear sclerosis (n=2); and retinal detachment
(n=1).    CONCLUSION: Vitreous surgery, when applied to epiretinal    membranes
or traction retinal detachments associated with    peripheral vascular tumors,
has a good chance of improving    vision. Treatment of the hemangioma, before
or during vitrectomy,    usually results in tumor regression.<p>

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the late stages of proliferative diabetic    retinopathy
(PDR) the vascularized posterior cortical gel (PCG)    contracts leading to a
partial posterior hyaloidal separation,    hemorrhage, and traction retinal
detachment (TRD). "Additional    epiretinal membranes" have been described
previously. These are    thin, usually transparent epiretinal membranes which
extend    anteriorly from the point of attachment of the elevated posterior
cortical gel to the edge of the TRD. The origin and frequency of    the
occurrence as well as the clinical significance of such    additional
epiretinal membranes are the subjects of controversy.    PURPOSE: To quantitate
the authors' clinical impression that    additional epiretinal membranes are
common in advanced PDR, to    characterize them immunohistochemically, and to
demonstrate the    rationale for the authors' surgical approach. METHODS:
Intraoperative observations for all patients undergoing diabetic    vitrectomy
and delamination over the last 2 years were reviewed    retrospectively. The
presence of additional epiretinal membrane    was searched for in the initial
stages of vitrectomy. When    identified, their apparent continuity with the
elevated portion    of the PCG was confirmed. Surgical specimens were obtained
from    nine patients for immunohistochemical study. RESULTS: Additional
epiretinal membranes were observes in 145 (81%) of 179    consecutive eyes with
PDR that underwent surgery for macular TRD.    Immunohistochemical staining
with type II collagen antibody was    positive in all specimens, suggesting
that these membranes were    of vitreous origin. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that
the additional    epiretinal membranes represent the posterior leaf of a split
PCG,    the anterior leaf being the elevated portion of the PCG. The two
leaves remain fused in the main, fibrovascular portion of the    epiretinal
membrane. These findings help explain the clinical    experience that once the
posterior leaf of the PCG is identified    and elevated, it provides an
accurate point of entry into the    surgical plane facilitating delamination of
the fused    (vascularized) portion of the PCG from the detached retina.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the anatomic and functional results of    large
retinotomies. METHODS: The charts of 33 consecutive    patients who underwent
peripheral retinotomy of 180 degrees or    more and silicone oil injection
during vitrectomy for retinal    detachment with proliferative
vitreoretinopathy were reviewed.    Silicone oil was removed from 26 eyes
(79%), but 2 hypotonic eyes    (6%) required reinjection of silicone. RESULTS:
After a minimum    follow-up of 6 months, the retina was completely attached in
28    eyes (85%). Twenty-eight eyes (85%) achieved a final visual    acuity of
5/200 or better, and seventeen eyes (51%) achieved    visual acuity of 20/200
or better. Intraocular pressure did not    change significantly from the
initial to the final examination.    At the last follow-up, hypotony
(intraocular pressure &lt; or = 5    mmHg) was seen in 1 of the 28 eyes with
reattached retina (3.6%).    A new macular epiretinal membrane, related to the
duration of    silicone oil tamponade, developed and was peeled off in 12 eyes
 (36%) in an additional procedure. No association could be found    between the
anatomic or functional results and the extent of the    retinotomy. Presented
herein is the largest series of    retinotomies of 180 degrees or more followed
up after silicone    oil removal. CONCLUSION: Large retinotomy (&gt; or = 180
degrees) in    selected cases of vitreoretinal surgery seems to be an effective
  procedure.<p>

AB  - We used electron microscopy and light-microscopic    immunohistochemistry
of cellular and extracellular markers to    characterize the cellular and
extracellular components of 15    surgically resected idiopathic epiretinal
membranes (IEMs). Ten    specimens from the eyes with posterior vitreous
detachment (PVD)    consisted of inner limiting membrane, collagen layer and a
 flattened cell layer. Six out of the 10 specimens were also    examined
immunohistochemically, and fibronectin and type I, II,    III and IV collagens
were identified in a characteristic lamellar    construct in the IEMs. On the
other hand, 5 specimens obtained    from the eyes without PVD consisted mainly
of a thick layer of    collagen fibrils with or without a flattened cell layer.
Two of    the 5 specimens were also examined immunohistochemically, and the
collagen fibrils in the specimens were identified as type II    collagen. Glial
cells (glial fibrillary acidic    protein-immunoreactive cells) were also
identified in 3    specimens. These results indicate that there are some
variations    in the IEMs.<p>

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor/binding protein in    human
diabetic epiretinal membranes.<p>
AD  - Moorfields Eye Hospital, Vitreo-Retinal Department, London, UK.<p>
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is thought to play a role in    the
development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.    Proliferative diabetic
retinopathy is characterised by the    formation of fibrovascular epiretinal
membranes, and IGF-I may    initiate and/or potentiate this epiretinal
proliferation. To    evaluate further the part played by IGF-I in the
development of    epiretinal tissue, we investigated the presence of IGF-I
receptor/binding protein in proliferating diabetic fibrovascular    epiretinal
membranes. Five fibrovascular epiretinal membranes    were obtained by
vitrectomy from five patients with proliferating    diabetic retinopathy. The
presence of IGF-I receptors was    investigated by autoradiography using
125I-labeled IGF-I on    frozen sections. To characterise binding specificity,
some    sections were preincubated with either insulin or unlabeled    IGF-I.
Sections of post-mortem liver were used as controls.    Strong labeling of
cells with 125I-labeled IGF-I was observed in    all epiretinal membranes and
in liver cells. Almost no    autoradiographic labeling was observed in sections
that had been    blocked with non-radioactive IGF-I, and very little labeling
was    found following blockage with insulin. Our preliminary study    suggests
the presence of IGF-I receptor/binding protein in human    diabetic epiretinal
membranes. These results support the    hypothesis that IGF-I may be involved
in the formation of    proliferative diabetic membranes.<p>

Philadelphia 19104, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to determine the incidence of macular    epiretinal
membrane formation in eyes treated for retinal breaks    after three different
modalities of treatment: laser    photocoagulation, cryotherapy, or both.
METHODS: We reviewed the    charts of 262 consecutive patients with a diagnosis
of retinal    tears and included 205 patients who had more than six months of
follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients were    treated. One
hundred seventy of these patients had retinal breaks    in one eye and 25
patients had breaks in both eyes, for a total    of 220 treated eyes. Cryopexy
was applied in 125 eyes, laser    retinopexy in 73 eyes, and both modalities in
22 eyes. Macular    epiretinal membranes developed in a total of 26 eyes: 12 in
the    cryopexy group, ten in the laser-treated group, and four in the    dual
modality group. No statistically significant difference, at    a level of P
&lt; or = .01, was seen in the rate of epiretinal    membrane formation between
the different treatment modalities. No    statistically significant difference,
at a level of P &lt; or = .01,    was seen in the rate of epiretinal membrane
formation in the    presence or absence of vitreous hemorrhage or in the type
of    precedent retinal break. CONCLUSIONS: After treatment of retinal
breaks with laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy, no    statistically
significant difference in the incidence of macular    epiretinal membrane
formation was demonstrated.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate current surgical results in patients with
familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and study the histologic    findings of
epiretinal membranes obtained at the time of surgery.    METHODS: We performed
phakic pars plana vitrectomy and membrane    peeling on five patients (six
eyes) with familial exudative    vitreoretinopathy, who ranged in age from 18
months to 9 years    and had traction retinal detachment. Membranes from two
eyes (two    patients) were analyzed by light and electron microscopy.
RESULTS: The macula was reattached in all six eyes. Visual acuity    improved
after surgery in five of the six eyes, with two eyes    improving from a
preoperative visual acuity of 20/400 to a    postoperative visual acuity of
20/25 and 20/60. Electron    microscopic analysis of the membranes from two
patients disclosed    thick fibrocellular fragments with vascular elements and
 astrocytes. CONCLUSION: With current surgical techniques, there    appears to
be improvement in the anatomic reattachment rate and    visual outcome in
patients with familial exudative    vitreoretinopathy. Amblyopia,
reproliferation, and vitreous    hemorrhage may limit long-term improvement in
vision.<p>

TI  - Cellular fibronectin and tenascin in experimental perforating    scleral
wounds with incarceration of the vitreous.<p>
AD  - Department of Anatomy, University of Helsinki, Finland.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior perforating eye injury carries a high risk    of
visual loss due to the formation of intravireal and epiretinal    scar tissue.
Intraocular scar formation in patients with retinal    detachment has been
shown to be associated with elevated    intravitreal FN levels. The
extracellular matrix glycoproteins    fibronectin (FN) and tenascin (TN) have
been located in    epiretinal scar membranes. As both FN and TN are also
involved in    healing of cutaneous and corneal wounds, we undertook to study
their expression in rabbit perforating scleral wounds with    vitreous
incarceration. METHODS: A perforating scleral wound was    produced and sutured
without removal of vitreous from the wound    in 18 pigmented rabbits. The
rabbits were killed at various times    (1 h to 21 days) after the operation,
and the indirect    immunohistochemical method was used for demonstration of FN
and    TN. Monoclonal mouse hybridoma antibodies 52 DH1 and 100 EB2,
recognizing the cellular form of FN (cFN) and TN, respectively,    were used.
RESULTS: During the first post-operative week    immunoreaction for
glycoproteins, both the locally produced cFN    and TN, were observed at the
scar tissue containing the prolabed    vitreous and the adjacent sclera.
Subsequently, the reaction    gradually shifted to the vitreal side of the
wound, and 3 weeks    after the operation it was almost completely restricted
to a    separated mass of vitreous beneath the scar. CONCLUSION: The
expression of cFN and TN in the scleral scar and vitreous is    indicative of
their local synthesis. The shift of the expression    of those proteins to the
vitreal side of the wound with time    suggests that the scarring process in
the vitreous is delayed    compared to the sclera.<p>

TI  - Retinal distortion and cotton-wool spots associated with    epiretinal
membrane contraction.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San    Francisco
94143, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: Several articles on surgery for macular    pucker
have noted the presence of intraretinal white spots,    presumably cotton-wool
spots, associated with epiretinal    membranes. It was proposed that membrane
contraction and    resultant nerve fiber layer distortion might lead to
blockage of    axoplasmic flow and thus a cotton-wool spot. To see whether the
 observations supported this concept, the authors studied patients    with
epiretinal membranes associated with intraretinal white    spots involving the
center of the fovea, where there are normally    no retinal vessels and the
only axons are in Henle fiber layer.    METHODS: Four patients with epiretinal
membranes associated with    prominent areas of intraretinal whitening
involving the center of    the fovea were examined before and after surgery.
Observations    and measurements were made from projected fundus photographs.
RESULTS: The intraretinal white spots, which appeared    preoperatively to lie
in the center of the fovea, proved to have    been pulled in from more
peripheral retina by the epiretinal    membrane. These white areas were
associated with surprisingly    great distortion of the inner retina.
Stretching of the inner    retina seemed to play a larger role in the retinal
distortion    than full-thickness retinal folding. CONCLUSION: The appearance
and time course of these intraretinal white lesions were    consistent with
cotton-wool spots caused by mechanical disruption    of axonal flow. The marked
retinal stretching and distortion of    the innermost layers of the retina were
the most striking    findings in this study and also seemed consistent with the
  concept that membrane contraction and resultant nerve fiber layer
distortion might lead to blockage of axoplasmic flow and thus a    cotton-wool
spot.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: A case of bilateral acute neovascularization of the    optic
disc and peripapillary epiretina of unknown etiology in a    previously healthy
26-year-old woman is discussed. METHODS: The    clinical course of the disease,
investigation, and treatment are    presented in detail. RESULTS:
Histopathologic examination of    epiretinal tissue removed from the second eye
at vitrectomy    provided evidence of inflammatory disease and suggested a
possible etiology. CONCLUSION: The cause of this patient's    disease remains
uncertain. Known causes of this disease were    excluded as far as possible.
Histopathologic examination of the    epiretinal membrane from the second eye
demonstrated an unusually    increased inflammatory response and multiple
intracytoplasmic    inclusion bodies in neutrophils resembling mollicute-like
organisms.<p>

TI  - Epiretinal membranes in Tersons syndrome. A clinicopathologic    study.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona,
Spain.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visual impairment resulting from retinal, subhyaloid,    or
vitreous hemorrhages in association with Tersons syndrome is    often
significant. The most common long-term sequelae that may    result in permanent
visual deficit is the formation of an    epimacular membrane. METHODS: This
report provides    clinicopathologic documentation of epiretinal membrane
proliferation secondary to Tersons syndrome. Pars plana    vitrectomy was
performed in 16 eyes of 11 patients with Tersons    syndrome. After removal of
vitreous hemorrhage, epimacular    membranes were found in 10 eyes (62.5%). The
posterior cortical    vitreous and the epiretinal tissue were examined
histologically.    RESULTS: Immunostainings with glial and retinal pigment
epithelial cell markers showed that the majority of cells derived    form the
glia. Perls staining, specific for iron, showed that the    high melanic-like
component contained in the histopathologic    samples corresponded to
degradation of blood products secondary    to chronic hemorrhage. CONCLUSION:
The high risk of epiretinal    membrane formation and the toxicity of blood
breakdown products    over the inner retina worsen the long-term visual
prognosis in    Tersons syndrome. Early surgery is advocated in such cases.<p>

TI  - The significance of vitronectin in proliferative diabetic
retinopathy.<p>
AD  - Abteilung fur Netzhaut- und Glaskoperchirurgie,
Universitat-Augenklinik, Koln, Germany.<p>
AB  - Vitronectin, an integrin-binding a-1-glycoprotein with potent
cell-adhesion and proliferation-mediating properties, has been    shown to be
incorporated in surgically removed membranes from    patients with
proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR),    proliferative diabetic retinopathy
(PDR) and macular pucker.    Therefore we developed an ELISA technique to
quantify levels of    vitronectin in human vitreous and plasma samples in order
to be    able to evaluate the significance of vitronectin in these    different
vitreoretinal diseases. Our results indicate a    significant increase of
vitronectin in all proliferative    disorders except idiopathic macular pucker.
Adjustment of all    probes to equal total protein content yielded a
significant    increase only in PDR (type II diabetes). Plasma samples
demonstrated a significant increase of vitronectin in patients    with type II
diabetes suffering from PDR. Therefore, break-down    of the blood-retina
barrier appears to be the most likely    explanation for the increased levels
of vitronectin in the    vitreous. Our results indicate that vitronectin may
not only be    involved in the regulation of epiretinal membrane formation at
significantly higher levels in patients with type II diabetes,    but the
increase of vitronectin in diabetic plasma may also help    to explain the
pathological alteration of the coagulation cascade    in diabetics.<p>

epiretinal membranes from patients with proliferative diabetic    retinopathy.
An immunohistochemistry and clinical study.<p>
AD  - Universitats-Augenklinik Regensburg, Germany.<p>
AB  - In the present study, we investigated the status of proliferation    and
activation of vascular endothelial cells in epiretinal    membranes from
patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy    (PDR) by means of
immunohistochemical techniques and compared the    findings with the main
clinical features of the patients. The    results showed that of 21
vascularized membranes, 17 (81%)    contained proliferating endothelial cells
(positive for    proliferating vascular endothelial cell marker EN 7/44) and 19
  (90%) were positive for endothelial cell activation marker    anti-VCAM-1;
Furthermore, by using a double-staining technique we    found that in 15 of the
17 cases (88%) the proliferating vascular    endothelial cells were activated
(expressing VCAM-1). Of the 18    type I diabetics, 15 (83%) contained
activated proliferating    endothelial cells, whereas in the 3 type II
patients, only 1    membrane contained activated proliferating endothelial
cells,    Preoperatively, 18 patients had severe vitreous hemorrhage, among
whom 15 (83%) contained proliferating endothelial cells, which    were
activated in 13 cases, and 16 patients had tractional    retinal detachment,
among whom 12 contained proliferating    endothelial cells, which were
activated in 11 cases. In all, 7    patients (33%) had vitreous rebleeding
within 8 months    postoperatively, whose membranes in 6 cases contained
proliferating and activated endothelial cells. In contrast, of    the 4
patients who were negative for EN 7/44, none had    rebleeding, and of the 6
patients who were negative for EN 7/44    and anti-VCAM-1, only 1 had
rebleeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250    WORDS)<p>

TI  - Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and    vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on proliferating    vascular endothelial
cells in diabetic epiretinal membranes.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of Regensburg, Germany.<p>
AB  - The present study demonstrated the expression of intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion    molecule-1 (VCAM-1),
the proliferating status of the neovascular    endothelial cells, and the
activation of vascular endothelial    cells bearing the two cell adhesion
molecules in diabetic    epiretinal membranes by using double
immunofluorescence and APAAP    techniques. The results showed that ICAM-1 was
detected in 36 out    of 40 (90%) proliferative diabetic retinopathy epiretinal
  membranes, VCAM-1 was found in 32 out of 40 cases (80%); in 21    out of 26
(81%) vascularised membranes the endothelial cells of    the new vessels in the
membranes were still in a proliferative    stage (positive for proliferating
endothelial cell marker EN    7/44) and, further, in 20 out of 26 cases (77%)
ICAM-1 was    detected on the proliferating endothelial cells and VCAM-1 was
found in 21 cases (81%). The expression of cell adhesion    molecules,
especially ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in diabetic epiretinal    membranes suggests that
cell to cell interactions may play a    significant role in the development of
PDR membranes. In    particular, the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on
proliferating    endothelial cells indicates the activation of these cells,
which    is the first critical step for lymphocyte/endothelial cell
interactions and the initiation of immune responses. The    significance of
proliferating status of the neovascularisation in    the membranes may be
related to the clinical course and prognosis    of the disease.<p>

cellular adhesion in proliferative vitreoretinopathy.<p>
AD  - Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, University of    Barcelona,
Spain.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE. To examine the possible role of some adhesion    multifunctional
glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix, such    as fibronectin (FN), laminin
(LN), vitronectin (VN) and their    receptors (beta 1-subunit complex and alpha
v beta 3 integrins)    in events of cell migration and adhesion in
proliferative    vitreoretinopathy (PVR). METHODS. Optical and
electron-immunocytochemical techniques were carried out on    epiretinal
membranes. Electrophoretic immunoblotting methods and    densitometric analysis
of normal and PVR vitreous were also    undertaken. Chi-square (chi 2) and
unbalanced analysis of    variance were employed for statistical analysis.
RESULTS. FN was    detected as a major component in the extracellular matrix in
both    fibrillar and pericellular arrangement. A change in pericellular
distribution to more fibrillous organization was related to the    time of
intraocular proliferative tissue development (P &lt; 0.001).    LN and VN were
observed as minor components in extracellular    matrix. A colocalized pattern
between VN and FN in collagenic    bundles of the matrix was often observed.
Beta-1 subunit and    alpha v beta 3 receptors were usually localized in a
position    that could mediate the interaction of FN, VN, and/or LN to the
cell plasma membrane. Increased levels of FN concentration were    observed in
both subretinal fluid and pathologic vitreous;    intravitreal FN concentration
tends to increase with clinical    stages of the evolution of PVR, whereas
intravitreal VN levels    tend to decrease. CONCLUSIONS. Results suggest that
FN could    mediate the initial events involved in epiretinal membrane
formation, and VN could modulate the adhesion mechanisms in    established
membranes.<p>

AB  - Following cryo surgery for retinal hole repair, visual effects in    the
senior author's eyes were caused by an epiretinal membrane.    Subjectively,
metamorphopsia was noted, and entoptically    perceived radial striae were
observed centred near fixation.    After subsequent cataract surgery,
metamorphopsia was not    detectable. Several months later, the centre of the
striate    entoptic pattern was observed to be centered several degrees from
fixation. Concurrently, loss of contrast in the central visual    field was
noted. In time, both the entoptic pattern and the    contrast effects became
less visible (contrast improved much    faster). The epiretinal membrane had
spontaneously separated from    the fovea. Repeated measurements of aniseikonia
were obtained    before cataract surgery, and after cataract surgery both prior
  to, and after the separation of the epiretinal membrane.    Inferences are

Report of 11 cases.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of Cologne, Germany.<p>
AB  - Anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy is characterized by
epiretinal proliferation that extends anteriorly over the    vitreous base, and
may, in addition to the cells usually    contributing to proliferative
vitreoretinopathy, also contain    cells of ocular structures located in that
area. We examined 11    complete globes with aPVR that were enucleated after
previous    severe trauma or perforating injuries (n = 8) and complicated
retinal detachment (n = 3) by a panel of immunohistochemical    markers. We
found presence of RPE, glial cells, macrophages and    fibrocytes, as
consistently reported in PVR membranes. In    addition, T-cell lymphocytes were
present in 6 of the cases, and    cells expressing the common leucocyte antigen
on 8 cases. Cells    staining positive for the intracytoplasmic contractile
filament    alpha-smooth muscle actin were present in 5 cases and cells
staining for desmin in one case. Collagen type IV was part of    most of the
membranes, and vessels with leakage of plasma factors    were present in more
than half of the cases.<p>

TI  - Isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor and its receptors in
epiretinal membranes: immunolocalization to retinal pigmented    epithelial
cells.<p>
AD  - Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute, Johns Hopkins University,    School of
Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.<p>
AB  - Epiretinal membranes (ERMs) form on the inner surface of the    retina in
conjunction with various ocular disease processes, but    the factors
controlling their development are not understood. The    predominant cell types
involved are retinal pigmented epithelial    (RPE) cells and retinal glia.
Cultured RPE cells secrete    platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is
chemotactic and    mitogenic for both RPE cells and retinal glia and,
therefore,    could be involved in the development of ERMs. In the present
study, we performed immunohistochemical staining for PDGF A chain    (PDGF-A),
PDGF B chain (PDGF-B), and both types of PDGF receptors    (PDGFr alpha and
PDGFr beta) on ERMs associated with various    disease processes. PDGF-A is
detected in most ERMs, regardless of    the associated disease process, and it
appears to be localized    predominantly in RPE cells, recognized by the
presence of pigment    and the immunohistochemical demonstration of some or all
of the    following RPE-associated epitopes: class III beta-tubulin,
keratin, the 65-kDa microsomal protein recognized by the RPE9    antibody, and
cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. PDGF-B is    found only in minor
subpopulations of cells in about half of the    ERMs evaluated and, with only
occasional exceptions, appears to    be localized almost entirely in
blood-borne cells found in and    around vessels in vascularized ERMs. Both
PDGFr alpha and PDGFr    beta are demonstrated in most ERMs with neither
isotype    consistently predominating: they are found predominantly on RPE
cells with many cells expressing both receptor types. ERMs with    little or no
RPE cell component contain little or no PDGF and    PDGF receptor, whereas
those in which the RPE cell represents the    major cell type, have widespread
PDGF and PDGF receptor    positivity. These findings show that RPE cells in
ERMs produce    PDGF-A and PDGF alpha and PDGF beta receptors and suggest that
 autocrine and paracrine stimulation with PDGF may be involved in    ERM
pathogenesis.<p>

Mass, USA.<p>
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate optical coherence tomography, a new    technique
for high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of the    retina, for quantitative
assessment of retinal thickness in    patients with macular edema. DESIGN:
Survey examination with    optical coherence tomography of patients with
macular edema.    SETTING: Referral eye center. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients
with    the clinical diagnosis of diabetes or diabetic retinopathy and 25
patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion,    uveitis,
epiretinal membrane formation, or cataract extraction.    MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURES: Correlation of optical coherence tomograms    with slit-lamp
biomicroscopy, fluorescein angiography, and visual    acuity. RESULTS: Optical
coherence tomograms of cystoid macular    edema closely corresponded to known
histopathologic    characteristics. Quantitative measurement of retinal
thickness is    possible because of the well-defined boundaries in optical
reflectivity at the inner and outer margins of the neurosensory    retina.
Serial optical coherence tomographic examinations allowed    tracking of both
the longitudinal progression of macular    thickening and the resolution of
macular edema after laser    photocoagulation. In patients with diabetic
retinopathy,    measurements of central macular thickness with optical
coherence    tomography correlated with visual acuity, and optical coherence
tomography was more sensitive than slit-lamp biomicroscopy to    small changes
in retinal thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Optical    coherence tomography appears
useful for objectively monitoring    retinal thickness with high resolution in
patients with macular    edema. It may eventually prove to be a sensitive
diagnostic test    for the early detection of macular thickening in patients
with    diabetic retinopathy.<p>

neuroretinitis.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington    University
School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) is
characterized by unilateral visual loss with vitreous    inflammation, optic
disc swelling, and the presence of gray-white    lesions in the deep retina,
and can be associated with    intraocular nematode infection. To date, no cases
of transretinal    membrane formation in DUSN have been reported. METHODS: A
22-year-old woman was examined for a 2-week history of unilateral    decreased
vision and neuroretinitis. A subretinal nematode was    identified and a
diagnosis of DUSN was made. The nematode was    destroyed with laser
photocoagulation. An epiretinal membrane and    traction retinal detachment
persisted and the membrane was    removed surgically, at which time it was
noted to be    transretinal, passing through a full-thickness retinal defect
into the subretinal space. Laser photocoagulation was performed    with the
argon green laser (400 mW, 400 microns, 100 msec).    Subsequent removal of the
epiretinal portion of the transretinal    membrane was performed via a pars
plana approach. The membrane    was studied by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). RESULTS:    The laser photocoagulation was successful in destroying the
 nematode. Partial resolution of the neurosensory detachment    resulted in
marked improvement in visual acuity. The membrane    consisted of a
pauicellular collagenous stroma with scattered    fibroblasts and mononuclear
inflammatory cells. CONCLUSION:    Removal of membranes affecting the macula
may be of benefit in    selected patients with DUSN.<p>

United States, predominantly occurring in healthy women in    their 60s who
have normal refractive errors. 2. Controversy    exists over not only the best
treatment options, but also whether    to treat at all. 3. The basic surgical
procedure consists of core    vitrectomy, the removal of the vitreous adherent
to the retina in    the posterior pole, the removal of epiretinal membrane when

culture and in epiretinal membranes.<p>
AD  - Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute, Johns Hopkins University    School of
Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287-9289, USA.<p>
AB  - The class III beta-tubulin isotype (beta III) is expressed    exclusively
by neurons within the normal human retina and is not    present in normal
retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in situ    or in 1 day-old primary
cultures; however, beta III is present in    RPE cells in 5-day primary
cultures and in passaged RPE cells    grown in monolayer cultures as determined
by immunohistochemistry    and Western blotting. beta III-positivity in
cultured RPE cells    is not affected by cell density or hydroxyurea- or
retinoic-acid-mediated growth inhibition, but only a few cells    weakly
express beta III in cyclohexamide-treated cultures and RPE    cells maintained
in serum-free medium fail to produce beta III.    When monolayer-cultured RPE
cells grown in normal,    serum-containing medium, are transferred to
irradiated bovine    vitreous, beta III is undetectable in most cells. Cultured
RPE    cells coexpress beta III with keratin and cellular
retinaldehyde-binding protein (both RPE cell markers), but not    with glial
fibrillary acidic protein. Some cultured RPE cells    also express
neuron-specific (gamma) enolase, which is    neuron-associated but not
neuron-specific, and occasional cells    in confluent or super-confluent
cultures contain the 200-kDa    neurofilament protein. Retinal glia,
fibroblasts, endothelial    cells, and smooth muscle cells do not express beta
III under the    same culture conditions. We have detected beta III in 45 of 56
  epiretinal membranes, frequently in cells with a bipolar or
dedifferentiated morphology, where its expression coincides with    other RPE
cell-associated antigens. Cells with morphological    features resembling
normal RPE cells in epiretinal membranes are    usually negative for beta III,
but RPE cells appearing to be in    the early stages of dedifferentiation
express the isotype weakly.    Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry
localizes beta III to    microtubules, ribosomes and cytoplasm. beta III may be
a useful    marker for recognizing the fraction of RPE cells in epiretinal
membranes that are no longer identifiable by morphological    criteria or other
RPE cell markers. These findings demonstrate    that mature human RPE cells
have the capacity to express a    neuron-associated gene in response to
conditions that promote    dedifferentiation.<p>

AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of Southern California    School
of Medicine, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the clinical course of accidental, single-focus
Nd:YAG laser injuries to the macula. METHODS: We reviewed the    clinical
course of five eyes (four patients) that sustained    macular injuries from a
Nd:YAG laser. All patients were examined    within 24 hours of injury and were
observed without surgical    intervention for a mean of 20 months (range, 12 to
32 months).    RESULTS: A single full-thickness foveal or parafoveal retinal
hole was apparent in all eyes either on initial examination or    within two
weeks of injury. All macular holes were within 650    microns of the foveal
center. The mean final visual acuity was    20/60 (range, 20/25 to 20/400) and
was related to the distance    between the macular hole and the foveal center.
None of the eyes    developed either subretinal neovascularization or
clinically    significant epiretinal membrane formation during the study
period. CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial poor visual acuity in    patients who had
a full-thickness foveal or parafoveal retinal    hole, visual acuity improved
without treatment when the site of    the laser injury was located outside the
foveal center.<p>

AD  - Retina Institute of Maryland, Baltimore 21204, USA.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fluorescein angiographic characteristics in eyes    with
pseudoholes of the macula associated with epiretinal    membranes have not been
studied extensively. METHODS: Stereo    photographs and fluorescein angiograms
from 83 consecutive eyes    of 80 patients with pseudoholes of the macula were
evaluated by    two independent graders for epiretinal membrane opacity,
fluorescence in the base of the pseudohole, and late perifoveal    pooling of
dye. RESULTS: Hyperfluorescence in synchrony with    choroidal fluorescence
appeared within the base of the pseudohole    in 52 (63%) of the 83 eyes
studied. The hyperfluorescence was    smaller than the pseudohole in 37 (45%)
eyes. Diffuse    hyperfluorescence filled the pseudohole in 15 (18%) eyes. No
fluorescence was seen in 20 (24%) eyes. Eleven (13%) eyes could    not be
graded due to coexistent macular disease or media opacity.    Fluorescence
within the area of pseudohole was less common in    eyes with opaque epiretinal
membranes than in eyes with visible    or transparent epiretinal membranes (P =
0.002). Fluorescence    within the area of the pseudohole was also less common
in eyes    with evidence of macular edema on fluorescein angiography (P &lt;
0.001). The mean visual acuity was better for eyes with    hyperfluorescence
within the area of the pseudohole than for eyes    without hyperfluorescence (P
&lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: A common    fluorescein angiographic characteristic
associated with    pseudoholes of the macula is early hyperfluorescence within
the    area of the pseudohole. This hyperfluorescence coincides with
choroidal filling and appears to be a form of transmission defect    rather
than a blocking of surrounding choroidal fluorescence by    the epiretinal
membrane. This central hyperfluorescence may    result in misdiagnosis of the
macular pseudohole as a    full-thickness macular hole.<p>

Endophthalmitis Study Group.<p>
RF  - REVIEW ARTICLE: 25 REFS.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute,    University
of Miami School of Medicine, FL, USA.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinical course and incidence of
culture-proven postvitrectomy endophthalmitis in 18 patients from    five
academic centers and three private practices. METHODS:    Patients undergoing
pars plana vitrectomy for recent trauma or    endophthalmitis were excluded.
The average age was 58 years    (range, 21-85 year). Sixty-one percent of the
patients (11/18)    had diabetes mellitus. The indication for initial
vitrectomy was    vitreous hemorrhage (n = 10), macular epiretinal membrane (n
=    3), recurrent retinal detachment with proliferative    vitreoretinopathy
(n = 2), retinal detachment with retinoschisis    (n = 1), proliferative
diabetic retinopathy with tractional    retinal detachment (n = 1), and
dislocated intraocular lens (n =    1). None of these eyes received
prophylactic intraocular    antibiotics during the vitrectomy. RESULTS: All
eyes were treated    with intraocular antibiotics after the diagnosis of
postvitrectomy endophthalmitis was made. Final visual acuity    ranged from
20/20 to no light perception and included five eyes    with 20/50 or better
visual acuity and 11 eyes with less than    5/200 visual acuity. Nine eyes had
a final visual acuity of no    light perception. Of the 16 eyes infected with a
single organism,    71% (5/7) of eyes infected with coagulase-negative
staphylococci    retained 20/50 or better final visual acuity compared with no
 eyes (0/9) infected with other organisms (P = 0.005). Two eyes    infected
with both coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and    Streptococcus had a final
visual acuity of 20/400. Three eyes    with a total hypopyon later had
enucleation or evisceration.    Based on the data from four medical centers,
the incidence of    endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy performed over
the    last 10 years was 9/12,216 (0.07%). CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis    after
vitrectomy is rare. Postvitrectomy bacterial    endophthalmitis caused by
organisms other than coagulase-negative    staphylococci has a poor visual
prognosis.<p>

TI  - [Acute retinal necrosis syndrome: diagnosis and treatment    strategy]<p>
AB  - The authors describe the clinical picture, diagnostic criteria,    and
treatment strategy in patients with the syndrome of acute    retinal necrosis,
based on their own findings and published data.    The syndrome of acute
retinal necrosis is binocular, the    difference in the time of involvement of
the paired eye varying    from 3 weeks to 18 months; the course of the disease
is extremely    severe. Starting as acute iridocyclitis, the disease rapidly
progresses and leads to the development of vaso-occlusive    necrotic
retinitis, eventuating in retinal tissue degradation at    the site of
involvement, formation of ruptures and detachment of    the retina. Detachment
of the retina developing during its acute    necrosis is associated with a
drastic hypotension and rapid    proliferative changes in the retina and
vitreous body with the    formation of numerous "dense" epiretinal membranes
and    funnel-shaped detachment of the retina. Active treatment strategy    is
recommended: emergency surgical intervention aimed at blocking    of necrosis
sites and ruptures of the retina. Such an approach    helped attain adherence
of the retina and stabilize the course of    the disease. Prolonged
conservative therapy of this syndrome is    ineffective.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinicopathologic features of an    epiretinal
membrane associated with a recurrent, full-thickness    idiopathic macular hole
and speculate on the mechanism(s)    contributing to its recurrence 1 year
after initially successful    closure of pars plana vitrectomy and gas
tamponade (SF6).    METHODS: After fixation of the 2 x 1 mm specimen in a
mixture of    1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde followed by 2.5%
glutaraldehyde, postfixation with osmium tetroxide, and standard
dehydration, the specimen was embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin    sections
were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for    transmission electron
microscopy. RESULTS: Ultrastructural    examination disclosed a fibrocellular
membrane composed of    Muller cells and fibrous astrocytes. Native collagen
was    entrapped in the matrix in some areas. CONCLUSION: Those cells    that
may lead to the closure of an idiopathic macular hole may    also contribute to
its recurrence if the reparative process goes    awry.<p>

AB  - Surgery is now an option in the treatment of macular holes.    However,
their clinical features may be subtle and many    conditions may masquerade as
full-thickness macular holes. To    promote diagnostic accuracy and thereby
avoid incorrect or    unnecessary surgery, we present several cases of entities
  misdiagnosed as full-thickness macular holes in an effort to    determine
which clinical features likely led to the inaccurate    diagnosis. Among these
were epiretinal membranes with    pseudoholes, impending macular holes,
lamellar macular holes, and    macular degeneration. Important features
allowing for a more    certain diagnosis included: fine, drusen-like yellowish
deposits    in the base of the hole; a surrounding cuff of subretinal fluid;
a distinct and circular margin around the hole; and an overlying    operculum.
Also, visual acuity was often relatively good in    non-macular hole cases,
while with true macular holes, vision is    usually 20/80 or worse, or
deteriorates to this level over a few    weeks. Many entities falsely diagnosed
as macular holes have a    favorable natural history, are not amenable to
surgical efforts,    or require slightly different surgical maneuvers.
Misdiagnosis    and wrongful treatment may be minimized by limiting macular
hole    surgery to cases in which visual acuity is 20/80 or worse or by
waiting for clinical changes sufficient to permit distinguishing    false from
early or atypical true cases.<p>

epiretinal membranes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy,    proliferative
vitreoretinopathy and macular pucker.<p>
AD  - Department of Clinical Ophthalmology, University of Bonn,    Germany.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether oxidative tissue damage and    inflammatory
reactions occur in epiretinal membranes of eyes    suffering from proliferative
diabetic retinopathy (PDR),    proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), and
macular pucker (MP).    METHODS: Epiretinal membranes were removed during
surgery and    frozen at -80 degrees C (PDR, n = 26; PVR, n = 24; MP, n = 15),
 and oxidative tissue damage and inflammatory activity (MPO) of    the membrane
tissue were determined. The values are expressed as    means of thiobarbituric
acid-reactive substances (TBARS, nmol/mg)    and MPO (units/mg). RESULTS: Both
TBARS and MPO activity were    significantly elevated (P &lt; 0.05) in
membranes of eyes suffering    from PVR and PDR compared to MP. The
myeloperoxidase activity in    PDR membranes was significantly increased (P
&lt; 0.05) compared to    PVR. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory cells and oxidative
metabolites    lead to oxidative reactions in PDR and PVR. The proliferation of
  membrane tissue may be enhanced through products of the    lipoxygenase
pathway, which is active in inflammatory cells and    leads to oxidative tissue
damage. Chemoattraction of leukocytes    by oxidative metabolites renders the
process self-progagating.    Since patients suffering from MP have an intact
vitreous body    with an intact antioxidative system, this reaction occurs to a
  lesser degree, resulting in less membrane-growth activity. The
cell-growth-enhancing properties of inflammatory cells should be    further
investigated in PDR and PVR with regard to new    therapeutic interventions.<p>

with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.<p>
AD  - University Eye Hospital Regensburg, Germany.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the potential contribution of
immune-mediated processes to the development of proliferative    diabetic
retinopathy (PDR), an immunohistochemical study was    undertaken to
characterize the infiltrating immune cells in    epiretinal membranes from the
eyes of patients with PDR. METHODS:    A total of 18 PDR epiretinal membrane
specimens obtained    surgically from pars plana vitrectomy were studied by
using a    panel of monoclonal antibodies against T lymphocytes (CD4 and
CD8), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R).    RESULTS:
Twelve of 18 specimens (67%) contained CD4-positive    cells and 13 of 18 (73%)
contained CD8-positive cells. IL-2 was    found in 12 of 18 samples (67%), of
which 11 also contained    CD4-positive cells, and IL-2R was detected in 10 of
18 membranes    (56%), of which 9 contained CD4-positive cells and released
IL-2.    Most of the IL-2R-positive membranes were from type I diabetic
patients, 40% of them from patients younger than 40 years.    CONCLUSION: Our
study demonstrated the involvement of activated    immune cells and release of
lymphokine(s) in more than half of    the diabetic epiretinal membranes tested
and revealed that the    processes of immune responses and the biological
effects of    lymphokine(s) may play an important part in the development of
epiretinal membranes of PDR, especially in young-onset and type I
diabetes.<p>

AB  - We report the clinicohistopathological findings of the    proliferative
vitreoretinopathy in an eye with Coats' disease    using the tissue obtained
during surgery. A 28-year-old man, who    had experienced poor vision in his
right eye for a period of 4    years, was referred to our hospital. Examination
revealed an    extensive yellow exudate in the subretinal space and a
tractional    retinal detachment. Prominent teleangiectatic retinal vessels
were also temporally present. Evident epiretinal membranes were    present in
the postequatorial area. We performed a scleral    buckling, vitrectomy,
membrane peeling, endophotocoagulation and    silicone oil tamponade. A
histological examination revealed that    the epiretinal membrane consisted of
collagen fibers, glial    proliferation, foam cells and lymphocytes. The foam
cell in the    epiretinal membrane is a characteristic finding in an eye with
Coats' disease.<p>

with daunomycin and silicone oil.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of Cologne, Germany.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: The cellular composition of primary and recurrent    periretinal
proliferations has been widely described. The use of    daunomycin, an
antiproliferative antibiotic, has been recommended    to reduce these
proliferations. Two recurrent membranes after    intraoperative application of
daunomycin were examined. METHODS:    Two epiretinal membranes, which were
removed 5 months and 20    months after vitrectomy with daunomycin, were
examined by light    and electron microscopy to determine the structure and
cellular    composition of these membranes. RESULTS: The matrix of the
membranes consisted of new collagen with fiber diameters between    20 and 22
nm. Fibrocytes and macrophages were present in both    specimens. Retinal
pigment epithelial cells and fibrous    astrocytes were present in only one
specimen. CONCLUSION: Retinal    pigment epithelial cells, which are
consistently present in    primary periretinal membranes, were found in only
one of the two    specimens examined. Myofibroblasts, also normally present,
were    not found. The other cells found are typically seen in primary
periretinal proliferations.<p>

AD  - Eye Research Institute, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether preoperative fluorescein angiograms    can
be used to predict visual prognosis in eyes undergoing    surgical removal of
idiopathic epiretinal membranes. METHODS: A    retrospective study of
preoperative fluorescein angiographic    findings in cases of idiopathic
epimacular membrane removal    during vitreous surgery was conducted. Of 422
consecutive cases,    229 met the criteria for minimum follow-up period of 6
months.    Angiograms from these 229 cases were analyzed in a standardized,
masked fashion for macular edema, retinal vascular distortion,    and
contraction of the foveal avascular zone. RESULTS: Visual    improvement was
greatest in 7 eyes (3%) with the most severe    degree of macular edema (P =
0.0215). No difference in visual    outcome was noted between eyes with less
severe macular edema or    no macular edema. Change in visual acuity was not
associated with    the extent of retinal vascular distortion (P = 0.477) or
contraction of the foveal avascular zone (P = 0.248). CONCLUSION:    The
presence of macular edema on preoperative fluorescein    angiography is not
predictive of a poor visual outcome in eyes    undergoing surgery for
idiopathic epiretinal membranes. In    general, preoperative fluorescein
angiography is not useful in    predicting visual prognosis in these cases.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the status of the macula after surgical    treatment
of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). METHOD:    Biomicroscopic and
fluorescein angiographic examination of the    macula was performed in 58 eyes
of 58 patients 6 to 7 months    after complete gas absorption for
rhegmatogenous retinal    detachment complicated by PVR (grade C1 to D3).
RESULTS: Macular    changes were found in 46 eyes (79.3%), and included:
cystoid    macular edema (30 eyes; 51.7%), epiretinal membranes distant from
the macula (3 eyes; 5.1%), macular pucker (7 eyes; 12%),    subretinal
membranes (5 eyes; 8.6%), and subretinal pigment    dispersion (5 eyes; 8.6%).
In five eyes, two distinct changes    were found. Optic dye leakage occurred in
4 eyes (6.8%).    CONCLUSION: Biomicroscopic and fluorescein angiographic
examination of the macula can be used to determine why eyes in    which
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment complicated by PVR is    successfully
repaired do not achieve good recovery of vision.    Spontaneous improvement or
disappearance of postoperative cystoid    macular edema, with late improvement
in visual acuity, may occur    in a small number of patients.<p>

AB  - Idiopathic macular hole and its early stages raises one of the    most
fascinating subjects in retinal disease. In this review, we    aim to summarize
the current knowledge of pathogenesis, the    recent classification and the
strategies for therapy. Recent    evidence strongly suggests tangential
traction induced by a thin    epiretinal membrane to be the main cause for
idiopathic senile    macular holes. A thickening of the epicortical vitreous
membrane    or the internal limiting membrane of the retina could be
demonstrated in these cases. When such a precursor situation    (stage I) is
present, in many cases there will be a progression    to a full thickness
macular hole (stage II). Further traction    usually causes an enlarging of the
defect in these eyes and the    classic appearance of macular holes (stage
III-IV) can then be    observed. The clinical appearance, the diagnosis and the
  strategies of treatment are discussed for all stages of    idiopathic senile
macular holes. Based on the deeper insight into    macular hole development,
prophylactic vitrectomy and removal of    the epiretinal membrane in cases of
stage I macular holes, has    been considered in order to prevent a further
progression of the    disease. There is also evidence that in stages II-IV
macular    holes, a closure of the hole and a visual improvement can be
gained by vitrectomy, removal of the epiretinal membrane and    fluid-gas
exchange. The additional application of biological    modifiers (transforming
growth factor-beta, human autologous    serum or tissue glue) may enhance the
adhesion of the detached    retina and therefore lead to better anatomical and
functional    success rates. The results of the pilot studies are reviewed and
 the surgical techniques as well as the possible complications are
discussed.<p>

AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of Cincinnati College of
Medicine, OH.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: A dense premacular hemorrhage may occur from    proliferative
diabetic retinopathy, a ruptured retinal artery    macroaneurysm, or Valsalva
retinopathy. Spontaneous clearing of    the hemorrhage in Valsalva retinopathy
usually occurs, taking    several months. In diabetic retinopathy, a traction
macular    detachment may result as early as 5 weeks after the hemorrhage.
In diabetic retinopathy or a macroaneurysm, only a fibrotic    epiretinal
membrane overlying the macula may develop. Observation    or vitrectomy is the
current way of managing a dense premacular    hemorrhage. This study was
undertaken to investigate an    alternative, neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser
membranotomy, in    treating this type of hemorrhage. METHODS: Six eyes in six
 patients had Q-switched Nd:YAG laser treatment to open trapped    hemorrhage
overlying the macula. One to three laser    membranotomies were performed.
Colored fundus photographs were    obtained before and after the hemorrhage was
treated. In some    cases, fluorescein angiography was done before the
hemorrhage was    treated. The size of the pretreated hemorrhage was estimated
from    the photographs and expressed in disc diameters. Patients with
diabetes had panretinal laser before Nd:YAG laser membranotomy.    RESULTS: The
premacular bleeding originated from proliferative    diabetic retinopathy in
four eyes and from a retinal artery    macroaneurysm in two. Average estimated
area of the pretreated    hemorrhage was 14 disc diameters. Five eyes had
marked clearing    of hemorrhage and rapid improvement of vision after Nd:YAG
laser    membranotomy. Average follow-up after laser treatment was 20
months. One diabetic eye required vitrectomy for rebleeding. One    eye had
little visual improvement due to pre-existing subretinal    bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Neodymium:YAG laser membranotomy seems    helpful in rapid clearing
of premacular hemorrhage in certain    eyes. A randomized prospective study is
needed to evaluate    observation, vitrectomy, and Nd:YAG laser treatment of
dense    premacular hemorrhage.<p>

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the role of retinal glial cells in    epiretinal
membrane formation. METHODS: We injected autologous    whole blood into the
vitreous cavity of albino rabbits and    studied the events in the
vitreoretinal interface at intervals    during the course of 1 year by light
and electron microscopy.    RESULTS: Epiretinal membranes were first found 2
weeks after the    treatment. At this stage, epiretinal membranes were composed
of    both glial cells and macrophages. Mitotic figures of glial cells    were
found in the retina. The nuclei of glial cells migrated,    passing through the
inner limiting membrane and onto the retinal    surface. At 6 months,
macrophages and red blood cells disappeared    from the epiretinal membranes.
The epiretinal membranes became    thicker with time. Finally, these epiretinal
membranes were    composed solely of glial cells. CONCLUSIONS: At the early
stage,    macrophages participate with glial cells in epiretinal membrane
formation; however, glial cells are the main constituent of    epiretinal
membranes during the late stage.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: These studies evaluated an erbium:YAG laser for    transection
of vitreous membranes, retinotomy, and incision and    ablation of epiretinal
membranes. METHODS: Elevated vitreous    membranes, detachments, and epiretinal
membranes were induced in    rabbit eyes. An erbium:YAG laser, emitting at a
wavelength of    2.94 microns and equipped with a flexible fiber and endoprobes
  with tips ranging from 75 to 375 microns, was used to perform    vitreous
membrane transections, retinotomies, and epiretinal    membrane incisions and
ablations in nontransmitting aqueous media    with the endoprobe in proximity
to the tissue. Ablations of    epiretinal membranes also were performed in
transmitting media,    including air and perfluoro-N-octane with the endoprobe
elevated    above the membrane. RESULTS: Twenty-five vitreous membrane
transections were made in 16 eyes at distances ranging from 0.5    to 4.5 mm
from the retina with radiant exposures ranging from 2    to 50 J/cm2 with
nonhemorrhagic retinal damage in a single    transection. Sharp, linear
retinotomies were created successfully    in five eyes. Epiretinal membrane
ablations were performed with    radiant exposures ranging from 1.8 to 22.6
J/cm2. In aqueous    media, results of microscopic examination showed partial-
to    full-thickness ablation with a maximum lateral thermal damage of    50
microns. In air- and perfluoro-N-octane-filled eyes, there was    increased
lateral damage with desiccation of residual tissue. In    12 aqueous-filled
eyes, 18 linear incisions were successfully    performed, with retinal
nonhemorrhagic damage in 2 eyes and    hemorrhage in 5. CONCLUSION: The
erbium:YAG laser may provide new    approaches to maneuvers performed in
vitreoretinal surgery.<p>

AD  - New England Eye Center, Tufts University School of Medicine,    Boston,
MA 02111.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To assess the potential of a new diagnostic
technique called optical coherence tomography for imaging macular    disease.
Optical coherence tomography is a novel noninvasive,    noncontact imaging
modality which produces high depth resolution    (10 microns) cross-sectional
tomographs of ocular tissue. It is    analogous to ultrasound, except that
optical rather than acoustic    reflectivity is measured. METHODS: Optical
coherence tomography    images of the macula were obtained in 51 eyes of 44
patients with    selected macular diseases. Imaging is performed in a manner
compatible with slit-lamp indirect biomicroscopy so that    high-resolution
optical tomography may be accomplished    simultaneously with normal ophthalmic
examination. The    time-of-flight delay of light backscattered from different
layers    in the retina is determined using low-coherence interferometry.
Cross-sectional tomographs of the retina profiling optical    reflectivity
versus distance into the tissue are obtained in 2.5    seconds and with a
longitudinal resolution of 10 microns.    RESULTS: Correlation of fundus
examination and fluorescein    angiography with optical coherence tomography
tomographs was    demonstrated in 12 eyes with the following pathologies: full-
and    partial-thickness macular hole, epiretinal membrane, macular    edema,
intraretinal exudate, idiopathic central serous    chorioretinopathy, and
detachments of the pigment epithelium and    neurosensory retina. CONCLUSION:
Optical coherence tomography is    potentially a powerful tool for detecting
and monitoring a    variety of macular diseases, including macular edema,
macular    holes, and detachments of the neurosensory retina and pigment
epithelium.<p>

TI  - Idiopathic macular hole: a clinical review and current concepts    in the
diagnosis and management.<p>
RF  - REVIEW ARTICLE: 66 REFS.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: A full-thickness macular hole is a retinal opening
involving the fovea causing severe central vision loss among the    elderly.
METHODS: This paper examines the pathogenesis and    mechanistic constructs for
the development and formation of    idiopathic macular hole, reviews the stages
of evolution, and    provides guidelines for management by the primary care
clinician.    An update of the current methods of diagnosis and the criteria
for surgical intervention, including vitrectomy and epiretinal    membrane
removal are presented. A perspective on the emerging    trends in the treatment
of macular hole using transforming growth    factor beta-2 application is also
introduced. CONCLUSIONS:    Clinical practice guidelines for the management of
patients with    macular holes can be established based on an improved
understanding of the pathogenesis of macular hole formation, a    knowledge of
the various stages of evolution, and the primary    care clinician's
familiarity with improved diagnostic techniques.    An enhanced understanding
of the pathogenesis of macular hole    will help to predict the risk for the
fellow eye, will promote    more effective patient education and counseling,
and will result    in more timely surgical intervention. RESULTS: More
promising    results in the surgical closure of macula holes can prevent or
minimize significant central vision loss.<p>

AB  - This study reports on the immunohistochemical staining for    cytokine
proteins of 26 epiretinal membranes obtained from eyes    undergoing surgery
for the treatment of proliferative    vitreoretinopathy. All specimens were
investigated for the    distribution of staining for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1
alpha),    interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)    and
interleukin-2 (IL-2). The results showed that 22 of the    membranes (85%)
stained for TNF alpha not only intracellularly    but also in the extracellular
matrix. This contrasts with the    findings that only 2 membranes stained for
IL-1 alpha and that    another 3 were positive for IL-1 beta. Staining for the
cytokines    IL-6 and IFN gamma was also observed in 9 and 7 membranes
respectively. None of the specimens investigated stained with    antibodies to
IL-2 or control antibodies, and none of three    normal retinas stained with
any of the antibodies used.    Pre-absorption of anti-cytokine antibodies with
the corresponding    human recombinant cytokines abolished staining of cells
and    extracellular matrix. The present findings support growing    evidence
that cytokine-mediated pathways of inflammation are    involved in the
pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy,    and draw attention to the
possibility that interaction between    extracellular matrix-bound cytokine and
inflammatory leucocytes    or resident cells of the retina may promote the
development and    perpetuation of this condition.<p>

retinal pigmented epithelial cells.<p>
AD  - Wilmer Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD    21287-9277.<p>
AB  - The retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) plays a major role in    normal
and exaggerated retinal wound repair; the latter can    result in epiretinal
membrane formation and loss of vision. The    RPE forms a stable monolayer of
highly differentiated cells that    proliferates only during wound repair. The
mechanism underlying    the change to the proliferating phenotype is unknown.
When grown    on a plastic substratum, cultured RPE cells mimic the
proliferating phenotype in situ; they escape density arrest and    proliferate
in serum-free medium. In this study, we have    demonstrated that a
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)    autocrine loop is involved in RPE
growth in serum-free medium,    because: (1) RPE cells secrete PDGF into their
media and express    PDGF receptors; (2) the PDGF receptors on RPE cells are
autophosphorylated in serum-free medium and suramin, an agent    that displaces
PDGF and other growth factors from their    receptors, blocks the
autophosphorylation; and (3) a neutralizing    antibody to PDGF significantly
decreases RPE growth in serum-free    medium. When a linear scrape is made in
an RPE monolayer, the    cells migrate and proliferate to fill in the gap
mimicking wound    repair in situ. Cells along the edge of the scrape show
increased    expression of PDGF and PDGF-beta receptors, and increased
staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen.    Immunohistochemistry and in
situ hybridization demonstrate    expression of PDGF in ganglion cells and
cells of retinal blood    vessels. PDGF is not detected in the outer retina or
RPE in    untreated eyes, but is detected in RPE participating in wound
repair, either adjacent to laser burns or underlying retinal    detachment.
PDGF and PDGF receptors are also expressed in RPE in    epiretinal membranes
removed during vitreous surgery. These data    suggest that PDGF is an
autocrine stimulator of growth in RPE    that plays a role in retinal wound
repair and epiretinal membrane    formation.<p>

AD  - Rayne Institute, Department of Immunology, St Thomas' Hospital,
London, UK.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cellular mechanisms of inflammation are thought to be
involved in the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy,    and
cytokines, which are products of cell activation, are known    to play an
important role in the development and maintainance of    inflammatory
reactions. It was the aim of this work to    investigate the presence of cells
expressing cytokine mRNA within    retinal membranes. METHODS: The presence of
mRNA coding for the    cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6
(IL-6)    and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was investigated in
19 epiretinal membranes obtained from eyes undergoing vitrectomy    for the
treatment of retinal detachment complicated by    proliferative
vitreoretinopathy. RESULTS: Cells expressing mRNA    for IL-1 beta were
observed in 7 membranes, cells positive for    IL-6 mRNA were seen in 12
membranes, and cells exhibiting mRNA    for TNF alpha were present in 9
specimens. Only three membranes    contained cells expressing mRNA for all the
cytokines    investigated. Four membranes possessed positive cells for IL-6
and TNF alpha, two contained cells expressing mRNA for IL-6 and    IL-1 beta,
and two others exhibited cells expressing mRNA for TNF    alpha and IL-1 beta.
Five membranes contained IL-6 mRNA-positive    cells only, whilst two exhibited
cells expressing mRNA for IL-1    beta or TNF alpha only. CONCLUSION: The
present findings indicate    that cellular activation may occur during the
development of PVR,    and suggest that these cytokines may be locally produced
by cells    infiltrating epiretinal membranes. The presence of IL-1 beta,
IL-6 and TNF alpha mRNA-positive cells within retinal membranes    provides
further evidence of a pathogenic role of these cytokines    in proliferative
vitreoretinopathy.<p>

AB  - Circumferential argon laser photocoagulation was administered as
preventive treatment for retinal detachment in 53 eyes with    extensive areas
of lattice degeneration and/or retinal breaks and    at least one additional
high-risk factor for retinal detachment.    Laser burns were applied in several
continuous rows 360 degrees    around the peripheral retina at the junction
between the    posterior border of the lesions and the unaffected retina. The
retina posterior to the treated areas remained attached in 51    eyes (96.2%)
during a mean follow-up period of 85.8 months (range    6 months to 18 years).
The treatment did not affect visual    acuity. The only complication was the
appearance in 2 eyes (3.8%)    of a delicate epiretinal membrane which,
however, did not require    surgical intervention.<p>

AB  - The development of five transplants of fetal retinal tissue to    adult
rat eyes was examined with the electron microscope. The    transplants were of
9 to 10 weeks total age after conception in    four cases and 20 weeks in one
case. They were at stage E15 when    transplanted. Transplants developed in
both the epiretinal and    subretinal spaces. The transplants were
heterogeneously developed    with some parts showing almost normal
differentiation and others    little. Subretinal transplants examined in this
study were more    developed than epiretinal grafts. Photoreceptor cells
developed    both inner and outer segments. Their synaptic terminals possessed
 output ribbon synapses with postsynaptic processes similar to    those seen in
normal retinas. In regions corresponding to the    inner plexiform layer, the
adult complement of synapses was seen,    including advanced features such as
serial synapses as well as    reciprocal synapses at bipolar cell dyads.
Incompletely    differentiated synapses of both the amacrine and bipolar cell
types were often observed, especially in the rat epiretinal    transplants.
Ganglion cell processes could not be identified with    certainty. Although
transplant cells were adjacent to host    photoreceptor cells and pigment
epithelium, obvious    specializations or interactions were not observed. The
experiments suggest that embryonic rat retinal cell transplants    develop most
or perhaps all of the structural components and    neuronal circuitry necessary
to transduce light and process some    visual information.<p>

TI  - Interleukin-1-beta changes the expression of metalloproteinases    in the
vitreous humor and induces membrane formation in eyes    containing preexisting
retinal holes.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, University of South Carolina School    of
Medicine, Columbia 29208.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy occurs when cells    migrate
into the vitreous humor, where they proliferate and    produce a membrane
composed of extracellular matrix.    Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) may be
involved in these processes    because it is chemotactic and mitogenic, and it
stimulates    metalloproteinase production. In the present study, the effects
of intravitreally injected IL-1-beta on retinal membrane    formation and the
associated changes in metalloproteinase content    of vitreous humor were
examined. METHODS. Rabbit eyes were    injected with IL-1-beta in a buffer,
with or without the prior    creation of retinal holes. Control eyes received
the buffer alone    or no injection, with or without retinal holes. Animals
were    examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy    for
1 month. Zymography was performed on a portion of vitreous    humor to assess
collagenase content, and the remaining tissue was    subjected to histologic
analysis. RESULTS. Intraocular IL-1-beta    induced perilimbal vessel
engorgement, keratic precipitates,    synechiae, flare, lens deposits, optic
disk hyperemia, and    granulomatous formations that gradually subsided during
the first    week. Intravitreal injection of IL-1-beta in eyes with
preexisting retinal holes additionally induced membrane    formation.
Zymographic analysis of vitreous humor from animals    sacrificed 24 hours
after IL-1-beta injection showed a 100-kd and    a 65-kd gelatinase, whereas
control vitreous humor contained    predominantly a single gelatinase species
of approximately 65 kd.    Retinal holes did not affect IL-1-beta induction of
the 100-kd    gelatinase. CONCLUSIONS. IL-1-beta induces a 100-kd gelatinase in
  the vitreous humor and epiretinal membrane formation in eyes    containing
preexisting retinal holes. The presence of retinal    holes and abnormal
production of cytokines may lead to a cascade    of events, including aberrant
extracellular matrix remodeling,    that result in proliferative diseases of
the eye.<p>

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the visual prognosis after    macular
hole surgery was different between recent and older holes    and to evaluate
preoperative characteristics and variations in    surgical technique that may
influence outcome. DESIGN: The    medical charts of all our patients who
underwent surgery for a    full-thickness macular hole were retrospectively
reviewed.    PATIENTS: Forty-eight eyes of 48 patients in the "early" group
(symptoms &lt; or = 6 months), and 20 eyes of 19 patients in the    "late"
group (symptoms &gt; 6 months). INTERVENTION: Vitrectomy,    separation of the
posterior hyaloid, gas tamponade, and    instructions to be face down for 1
week. Most patients had    epiretinal membrane dissection. MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURES: The early    and late groups were compared regarding anatomic and
visual    outcomes. In the early group we evaluated the effect on outcome    of
the stage of the hole, intraocular tamponade, membrane    dissection, and
travel distance. RESULTS: Median postoperative    visual acuity in the early
group was 20/40 at 3, 6, and 12    months. Fifteen (56%) of 27 patients gained
at least three lines    of vision at 12 months. Anatomic success was seen with
one    operation in 75% (36/48), and with two operations in 87.5%    (42/48).
Stage 2 holes had a final anatomic success rate of    94.4%. Of respondents to
an informal survey, 63.4% (26/41)    believed that vision was greatly improved,
and 70.3% (26/37) said    that they would definitely choose surgery again. In
the late    group, median postoperative visual acuity was 20/100 at 6 months,
compared with 20/142 preoperatively. Closure of the hole with one    operation
was seen in 60% (12/20) of the patients in the late    group. CONCLUSIONS:
Surgery in patients with recent macular holes    has a better prognosis for
visual rehabilitation than with older    holes and appears to be considered
beneficial by most patients.<p>

AB  - Methods of treating vitreoretinal scarring have been transformed    by
the introduction and development of closed intraocular    microsurgery.
Controlled access to the posterior segment of the    eye, under excellent
conditions for intraoperative viewing, have    increased our understanding of
the pathophysiology of epiretinal    membranes. The ready ability to harvest
tissue specimens for    histopathological and immunochemical study, enabled by
this type    of surgery, has provided the stimulus for much basic research
into the nature of fibrocellular (and fibrovascular)    proliferative disease.
Treatment of retinal conditions    characterised by the proliferation of
fibrocellular membranes has    been improved, but the most important future
advances are likely    to be made in the fields of molecular biology and
pharmacology.<p>

AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University Eye Center, Durham,    NC.<p>
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of early intervention with
vitrectomy for dense, nonclearing, infantile vitreous hemorrhage.    DESIGN:
Case series. SETTING: Referral practice at a major    university hospital eye
center. PATIENTS: Consecutive, referred    sample of six patients (&lt; 1 year
old) with dense vitreous    hemorrhages. The causes of the vitreous hemorrhages
were varied.    Follow-up was from 8 months to 15 months, with an average of 10
  months. INTERVENTIONS: Three-port, pars plana, complete posterior
vitrectomies were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improved    visual acuity
postoperatively and frequency of complications.    RESULTS: Complications of
the infantile vitreous hemorrhage    included traction retinal detachment (two
of six), epiretinal    membrane formation (one of six), pigmentary retinopathy
(four of    six), strabismus (two of six), large anisometropic myopia (two of
six), and occlusion amblyopia (three of six). These serious    complications
occurred as early as 5 weeks after the onset of the    vitreous hemorrhage.
Iatrogenic retinal dialyses, which occurred    in two of six patients, were
successfully treated. Marked to    moderate visual improvement was noted in
five of six patients.    CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy is an acceptable early therapy
for    infantile vitreous hemorrhage, and we recommend that vitrectomy    be
considered as early as 3 to 4 weeks after the onset of a    dense, infantile,
vitreous hemorrhage in an attempt to avert    serious complications of the
hemorrhage.<p>

TI  - Surgical results in the vitreomacular traction syndrome.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: The vitreomacular traction syndrome is a distinct    clinical
entity in which partial posterior vitreous detachment is    present in
combination with persistent macular adherence, causing    traction-induced
visual deficit. The authors evaluate the results    of vitreous surgery for
this syndrome. METHODS: The authors    reviewed 20 consecutive eyes that
underwent vitrectomy and    posterior hyaloid/epiretinal membrane stripping to
better define    the clinical features, visual results, and complications of
surgery for the vitreomacular traction syndrome. FINDINGS: Eyes    were
categorized anatomically as having either "classic"    vitreomacular traction
syndrome (8 [40%] eyes had 360 degrees    midperipheral vitreous detachment) or
"variable" vitreomacular    traction syndrome (12 [60%] eyes had a variety of
midperipheral    areas of vitreous separation). Release of vitreomacular
traction    resulted in improvement in vision of two or more lines in 15
(75%) eyes, with 8 (40%) obtaining 20/50 visual acuity or better.    All eyes
were followed for at least 6 months. Complications of    vitreous surgery
included progression of nuclear sclerosis (83%    of phakic eyes), epiretinal
membrane formation (40%), and retinal    breaks (20%). CONCLUSION: The
vitreomacular traction syndrome    represents a wide spectrum of vitreoretinal
anatomic    configurations that can produce visual deficit. Vitrectomy
surgery to release macular traction may improve visual acuity.<p>

TI  - Late re-opening of macular holes after initially successful    treatment
with vitreous surgery [see comments]<p>
CM  - Comment in: Ophthalmology 1995 Feb;102(2):172-3<p>
AD  - New England Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine,
Boston, MA 02111.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: In more than 50% of eyes with idiopathic,    full-thickness
macular holes, vitrectomy results in clinical    closure of the hole and
improvement in visual acuity. Other than    cataract formation, late
complications of the procedure have not    been reported. METHODS: Over a
4-year period, 167 eyes underwent    successful vitreous surgery for idiopathic
macular holes    documented by clinical closure of the hole and an improvement
in    visual acuity of at least two Snellen lines. The authors
retrospectively studied eight of these eyes. All initially had    successful
surgery; however, they subsequently had spontaneous    late re-opening of the
macular hole with acute diminution in    vision. RESULTS: Late re-opening
developed in these eyes between    2 and 22 months after initial surgery. The
mean time for    re-opening was 12.5 months. Three of eight eyes underwent a
second vitrectomy, which was successful in improving visual    acuity in two
eyes. Another patient manifested the growth of an    epiretinal membrane that
apparently sealed the re-opened macular    hole and improved vision.
CONCLUSION: Late re-opening can    complicate initially successful macular hole
surgery and may    occur in at least 4.8% (8 of 167) of initially successful
operations. Re-opening has been documented as late as 22 months    after
initial surgery. Repeat vitrectomy with gas injection may    result in
reclosure of the hole and improvement in vision.<p>

AB  - BACKGROUND: Candida endophthalmitis may occur either during    systemic
Candida infection (candidemia), particularly in    immunocompromised hosts or
as a single manifestation in drug    abusers. PATIENT AND METHODS: One case of
endogenous candida    endophthalmitis (ECE) in a patient with systemic
candidiasis and    four cases of drug abusers are presented. Well confined
inflammatory lesions in retina and choroid were adequately    treated with
systemic Amphotericin B administration, whereas    lesion extension beyond the
internal limiting membrane towards    the vitreous required surgical
management, to remove epiretinal    fibrovascular tissue, and intravitreal
Amphotericin B injection.    CONCLUSION: In all cases, treatment resulted to
regression of the    lesions, however visual function recovery depends on
location of    chorioretinal lesions.<p>

AB  - BACKGROUND: Macular epiretinal membranes, whether idiopathic or
secondary to vitreo-retinal pathology may result in a lowering of    central
vision and/or metamorphopsia following a distortion of    retinal tissue.
Although an adequate surgical peeling procedure    is known to result in a
functional improvement, the criteria for    patient selection for such
intervention are, as yet not clearly    established. METHODS AND RESULTS: In
order to establish    prognostic indicators of a good visual recovery, we
studied 25    cases of epiretinal membrane. Our results showed an improvement
in visual acuity of 2 or more Snellen lines among 34% of our    patients,
regardless of their initial visual acuity. The duration    of symptoms prior to
intervention was found to be a prognostic    factor whereas the presence of
macular edema detected    preoperatively on fluorescein angiography had no
effect on the    final visual outcome. CONCLUSION: A common post-operative
complication came to our attention: secondary opacification of    the
crystalline lens.<p>

AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary,
Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a series of patients with seronegative    arthritic
syndromes and HLA-B27-associated uveitis with severe,    sight-threatening,
posterior segment ocular manifestations.    METHODS: The authors reviewed the
records of 29 patients (17.4%)    with posterior segment involvement from a
cohort of 166 patients    with HLA-B27-associated uveitis. The inclusion
criteria included    individuals with a positive HLA-B27 who had at least one
of the    following findings: (1) severe vitreous inflammation; (2)
papillitis; (3) retinal vasculopathy; or (4) pars plana exudates.    The study
population comprised 13 men and 16 women with a mean    age at onset of uveitis
of 35.2 years. The average duration of    the uveitis was 5.3 years, and the
median follow-up time was 26    months. FINDINGS: Posterior segment involvement
occurred in 34    eyes of the 29 patients. The most common findings included
severe    and diffuse vitritis in 93.1% of the patients and papillitis in    24
patients (82.7%). Retinal vasculitis occurred in seven    patients (24.1%), and
pars plana exudates were present in two    patients (6.8%). Cystoid macular
edema (37.9%) and epiretinal    membrane (17.2%) were common causes of visual
impairment.    Systemic immunosuppressive therapy was required for control of
inflammation in 32% of the patients. CONCLUSION:    HLA-B27-associated uveitis
may be related to severe,    sight-threatening posterior segment manifestations
in some    patients; this is an under-recognized phenomenon. These patients
may require the use of aggressive systemic immunosuppressive    therapy to
control inflammation and preserve vision.<p>

TI  - Erbium:YAG laser photothermal retinal ablation in enucleated    rabbit
eyes.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts.<p>
AB  - The erbium:YAG laser has been shown to produce precise tissue    ablation
because of the high water absorption of the 2.94-microns    wave-length emitted
by this laser. We used an experimental system    to create lesions of various
depths in the surface of the rabbit    retina in enucleated eyes in vitro to
examine the potential    application to maneuvers such as retinotomy and the
removal of    epiretinal membranes in vitrectomy. With an air/retinal
interface, single pulses produced discrete craters in the retinal    surface
with a depth proportional to fluence, ranging from 30    microns for a pulse of
1.3 J/cm2 to a full-thickness retinotomy    at 3.9 J/cm2. An adjacent zone of
coagulated tissue ranging in    size from 15 to 40 microns was noted. Multiple
pulses had an    additive effect. With a fluid/retinal interface, 20 pulses of
3.6    J/cm2 produced a full-thickness retinotomy, with an adjacent zone    of
damaged tissue up to 1 mm, caused by effects of volatilization    of
intervening fluid. The erbium:YAG laser may have a role in    vitreoretinal
surgery.<p>

AB  - Retinal abnormalities have been described in both animals and    humans
exposed to cocaine during development. The present study    was designed to
examine the morphological repercussions of    neonatal exposure to cocaine on
the developing retina of the rat.    Male Wistar rats were given 15 mg/kg body
weight per day of    cocaine hydrochloride subcutaneously on postnatal days
(PND) 0-6,    13 and 29 and sacrificed at PND 7, 14 or 30; controls were given
 saline. The retinas were processed for electron microscopy.    Retinal
quadrants were embedded flat and vertical semithin and    ultrathin sections
obtained. PND 7 sections showed discrete    intraretinal hemorrhages, PND 14
sections showed massive    intraretinal hemorrhages and images of ischemic
necrosis in the    nerve fiber layer and PND 30 sections showed cavity lesions
in    the hemorrhagic areas, gliosis and pigmented macrophage-rich
epiretinal membranes; photoreceptor rosettes were also found.    These results
are the first morphological demonstration of    retinal hemorrhages and
associated epiretinal membranes following    neonatal exposure to cocaine in
the rat. These changes are    probably related to the ischemia/hypoxia induced
by cocaine.<p>

RF  - REVIEW ARTICLE: 41 REFS.<p>
AD  - Centre Hospitalier National d'Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts,
Paris.<p>
AB  - Eighty cases Diabetic Cystoid Macular Edema, with or without    central
spaces underwent photocoagulation from 1978 to 1989 using    a horseshoe or
ring pattern. Initial visual acuity ranged from    20/25 for far vision and
20/20 for near vision to a central    scotoma, with an average of 20/60 for far
vision and 20/50 for    near vision. As initial treatment, we performed 63
horseshoe    pattern and 13 ring pattern photocoagulation around the macula;
an additional photocoagulation was carried out in 29 cases, one    month to
seven years later (average of 18.3 months), either on    medial to the previous
treatment (18), or closing the initial    horseshoe pattern (10) or resulting
in focal treatment (13), or    associating any of these three. The cystoid
macular edema    disappeared in 47 cases, decreased in 15 cases, and remained
in    14 cases, with a follow up ranging from 6 months to 10.5 years
(average of 41.6 months). The post laser visual acuity range from    20/25 for
far vision and 20/20 for near vision, to a central    scotoma again, with an
average of 20/60 for far and near visions.    During the follow up various
reasons of visual impairment were    observed: cataract, intravitreal
hemorrhage, epiretinal membrane,    macular pucker and macular ischemia. Our
results compared with    the published ones concerning a grid pattern
photocoagulation are    encouraging. It is very important to stress that this
photocoagulation is only aimed toward the macular edema itself:    if necessary
it should be associated with a grid pattern or a    focal photocoagulation
aimed toward extramacular edema.<p>

fluorouracil.<p>
AD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, School    of
Medicine, University of Miami, FL.<p>
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a biodegradable device for the
intravitreal sustained release of fluorouracil in the treatment    of
tractional retinal detachment due to proliferative    vitreoretinopathy.
METHODS: A 6 x 0.9-mm (20-gauge) cylindrical    solid implant molded from
copolymers of lactide and glycolide    admixed with 1 mg of fluorouracil was
placed in the vitreous    cavity of rabbits in which retinal detachment with
proliferative    vitreoretinopathy had been initiated. Comparisons of the
control    (drug-free polymer) and experimental (fluorouracil polymer)
groups were made with weekly indirect ophthalmoscopic    examinations. In
another experiment, the intravitreal    concentration of fluorouracil was
tested at each time point.    RESULTS: Retinas of eight (89%) of nine rabbits
that received the    polymer with fluorouracil remained attached compared with
only    one animal (11%) that received the control polymer without the    drug.
The therapeutic effect of the drug-containing implant was    associated with
sustained intravitreal concentrations of    fluorouracil between 1 and 13 mg/L
for at least 14 days, and    fluorouracil concentrations remained above 0.3
microgram/mL for    almost 21 days. No evidence of the toxic effects of the
drug or    polymer implant was observed with electroretinographic and
histopathologic study. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal implantation of
biodegradable polymers containing fluorouracil can prevent    proliferation of
epiretinal membranes resulting in complicated    retinal detachment in an
animal model of proliferative    vitreoretinopathy and indicate their possible
usefulness for    intravitreal delivery of therapeutic agents.<p>

AB  - PURPOSE: The authors analyzed the incidence of cataract    development
and the visual outcome of cataract surgery performed    on patients with
sarcoidosis-associated uveitis who were treated    at the Immunology Service at
the Massachusetts Eye and Ear    Infirmary during a 17-year period. METHODS:
The records of 102    patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis who were
treated    with topical and regional corticosteroids, systemic nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic steroids, or with systemic
immunosuppressive chemotherapy were reviewed. Cataract surgery    was performed
on those eyes in which cataract developed,    resulting in decreased visual
acuity of 20/100 or less. The    incidence of cataract development and visual
results of cataract    extraction and intraocular lens implantation were
analyzed.    RESULTS: In this cohort of 102 patients, visually significant
cataracts that warranted surgery developed in 10 (16 eyes). In    addition,
four patients (5 eyes) had a visually significant    cataract at the time of
first evaluation. A total of 14 patients    (21 eyes) underwent cataract
surgery. Posterior chamber lens    implantation accompanied cataract surgery in
19 (90.5%) of 21    eyes. The average final visual acuity of the 21 eyes after
 cataract surgery was 20/51, and 61% of the eyes achieved a stable    visual
acuity of 20/40 or better. The major causes of the    decreased visual acuity
in patients who had less than 20/40    visual acuity were sequelae of chronic
posterior uveitis, cystoid    macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and
glaucomatous optic nerve    damage. CONCLUSION: Posterior chamber lens
implantation and    cataract surgery in patients with sarcoidosis-associated
uveitis    can be well tolerated when absolute control of the inflammation
is achieved. Pre-existing retinal pathology and glaucoma as a    result of
uncontrolled inflammation resulting in permanent ocular    structural damage
were found to be the most important factors for    determining the
postoperative final visual acuity.<p>

TI  - Cytokines and serum cause alpha 2 beta 1 integrin-mediated    contraction
of collagen gels by cultured retinal pigment    epithelial cells.<p>
AD  - Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of South
Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia 29208.<p>
AB  - PURPOSE. Integrins, heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins, are
involved in cell-substratum and cell-cell interactions. The role    of these
molecules in cytokine-mediated contraction of    extracellular matrix by
retinal pigment epithelial cells has been    investigated in a model system
that may mimic epiretinal membrane    contraction during retinal detachment in
proliferative    vitreoretinopathy. METHODS. Retinal pigment epithelial cells
were    cultured on three-dimensional collagen gels that they cause to
contract. The involvement of new protein synthesis and    C-kinase-mediated
signal transduction were studied using specific    inhibitors. Cell surface
integrins synthesized by pigment    epithelial cells were identified using
immunofluorescence, and    the same antibodies were used in gel contraction
assays to    identify the integrin species responsible for force transduction.
 RESULTS. Contraction of collagen type I gels was small without    cytokines
but was greatly enhanced in the presence of serum or    IL1 plus TGF beta. It
was dependent on new protein synthesis.    Contraction induced by the
combination of cytokines was dependent    on active protein kinases, whereas
that induced by serum was not    because only the former was inhibited by
staurosporine, a    C-kinase inhibitor. Pigment epithelial cells were found to
 produce beta 1, alpha 2, and alpha 5 integrins, but only alpha 2    and beta 1
appeared to participate in the contraction process    because only antibodies
against these integrins inhibited    contraction. CONCLUSIONS. Retinal pigment
epithelial cells    contract an extracellular matrix in vitro in a manner
similar to    epiretinal membrane contraction in vivo. This contraction is
mediated via cell surface glycoproteins of the integrin family    that bind
directly to extracellular matrix molecules.<p>

AB  - An immunohistopathological study was performed on 33 epiretinal
membrane specimens obtained during vitreoretinal surgery from    patients with
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment complicated with    proliferative
vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Immunofluorescence and    immunoperoxidase methods
were used to detect major    histocompatibility complex or HLA antigens and
immunocompetent    cells, and to identify the cellular and the extracellular
component of the proliferative tissue. The following antigens    were detected
in epiretinal membranes: cytokeratin in 18 (of 18    cases studied for this
antigen), glial fibrillary acidic protein    in 20 (of 20), vimentin in 20 (of
20), actin in 16 (of 18),    fibronectin in 20 (of 20), macrophage CD68 in 16
(of 18),    leukocyte common antigen in 12 (of 18), T-cell CD45R in 13 (of
22), HLA-ABC in 27 (of 33), HLA-DR in all the 33 membranes and    HLA-DR alpha
chain in 32 of 33 membranes. We observed the    presence of macrophages and of
an activated T-cell population in    PVR membranes. HLA-DR antigen expression
was found on pigmented    and nonpigmented epithelial cells and on mononuclear
cells in all    epiretinal membranes. The HLA-DR expression on retinal
pigmented    epithelial cells could play a role in triggering a local immune
response in PVR. These findings suggest the involvement of    immunological
phenomena and probable interactions between the    immune system and peptide
growth factors.<p>

TI  - Retinal detachment with severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy in
Terson syndrome.<p>
AD  - 1st University Eye Clinic, Vienna, Austria.<p>
AB  - BACKGROUND: In several reports, early vitrectomy has been    proposed for
eyes with vitreous hemorrhage due to Terson syndrome    as a means to hasten
visual recovery. But the development of    nuclear sclerosis and the neurologic
problems arising from this    disease encourage surgeons to wait for
spontaneous resorption,    especially with young patients. Although the
formation of    epiretinal membranes has been described, to the authors'
knowledge retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy    in Terson
syndrome never has been observed. METHODS: The authors    report five eyes from
four patients with Terson syndrome due to    spontaneous aneurysm rupture, in
whom retinal detachment with    proliferative vitreoretinopathy developed.
RESULTS: The early    onset and the severe clinical course of proliferative
vitreoretinopathy in these eyes showed parallels to traumatic    proliferative
vitreoretinopathy. The retina in all eyes could be    reattached. CONCLUSION:
The authors point out the necessity for    accurate and close follow-up and
early, extensive surgical    treatment in Terson syndrome, especially in
patients with a    reduced general state of health.<p>
