<strong><font size = "+2">Introduction</font></strong>
<p>
	The entry of HIV into a target cell represents the key initial step in vthe replication cycle of this virus.  The entry process involves a coordinated series of molecular interactions between the two components of the virus glycoprotein complex (gp120(SU)/gp41(TM)) and the two components of the receptor complex (CD4 and a chemokine receptor). It results in the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell and the introduction of the viral replicative machinery into the cytoplasm.  It has been well established over the past several years that conserved domains of gp120 come together to form the binding site for amino-terminal residues of the CD4 molecule (Moore et al., 1993<a href = "#ref73"><sup><strong>73</strong></sup></a>).  For most HIV and SIV isolates, this SU-CD4 interaction defines the cell type to which the virus binds and ultimately enters (Sattentau and Moore, 1993<a href = "#ref95"><sup><strong>95</strong></sup></a>).  Recent data have shown, however, that for the process of membrane
fusion to proceed, a second interaction, with a member of the chemokine
receptor family of multiple membrane-spanning proteins, must occur. 
Natural isolates of HIV-1 which primarily infect macrophages and
monocytes but lack the ability to infect T-cell lines utilize CCR5 ,
while T cell-line adapted and syncytium-inducing (SI) viruses primarily
utilize CXCR4 (reviewed in Berger, 1997<a href = "#ref04"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>; Doms and Peiper, 1997<a href = "#ref26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup></a>; Moore,
1997<a href = "#ref72"><sup><strong>72</strong></sup></a>).  Binding of the receptor complex results in conformational changes
in both gp120 and in the TM protein gp41.  By analogy with the
hemagglutinin of influenza virus, the TM protein is thought to be the
engine that drives the membrane fusion process, and it is this
multifaceted molecule that is the subject of this review.
<p>
<strong><font size="+2">Biosynthesis of Env</font></strong>
<p>
	The SU and TM components of the envelope glycoprotein complex are
synthesized, as a single, co-translationally glycosylated, polyprotein
precursor (gp160), on ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER).  Individual precursor molecules, shown schematically in Figure 1,
initiate folding, presumably in the presence of ER-associated
chaperonins, and assemble to form an oligomeric structure (Hunter and
Swanstrom, 1990<a href = "#ref57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup></a>).  Whether this is a trimeric or tetrameric molecule
remains unresolved, although recent data suggest that a trimer is the
biologically relevant form of the oligomer and this would be consistent
with the findings for other retroviruses (see below).  Mutagenic studies
in both HIV and Rous sarcoma virus suggest that it is regions within the
TM domain that direct and stabilize the oligomerization process (Earl and
Moss, 1993<a href = "#ref31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup></a> Einfeld and Hunter, 1994<a href = "#ref37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup></a> Einfeld and Hunter, 1997<a href = "#ref38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup></a>).  It is
likely that this region is structurally conserved between HIV and SIV,
since mixed Env oligomers have been described (Doms et al., 1990<a href = "#ref25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup></a>). 
Surprisingly, the membrane-spanning domain is not required for oligomers
to form, although it and regions within the cytoplasmic domain may
provide stability to the structure (Earl and Moss, 1993<a href = "#ref31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup></a> Einfeld and
Hunter, 1988<a href = "#ref38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup></a>).  Formation of an Env oligomer appears to be required for
efficient transport out of the ER.

as well as T- and B-cell epitopes are shown to scale.  The position of the

<p>
	Shortly after the stable oligomer is formed, it is transported from the
ER to the Golgi complex where the bulk of the mannose-rich
oligosaccharide side chains are processed to hybrid/terminally
glycosylated forms.  In a late Golgi compartment, most likely the
trans-Golgi network, the precursor is cleaved to gp120 and gp41 by a
cellular proteinase.  Furin and PC7 appear to be the most likely
candidates for this action (Decroly et al.,1997<a href = "#ref23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup></a> ; Hallenberger et al.,
1997<a href = "#ref50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup></a>).  These enzymes, members of the subtilysin family of proteinases,
recognize and cleave at a highly conserved basic sequence (RXXR) that
links the C-terminus of gp120 to the N-terminus of gp41.  Cleavage is
important since it frees the fusion peptide at the amino-terminus of gp41
from the C-terminus of gp120, which is critical for its future role in
fusion.  It is also probably accompanied by conformational changes in the
oligomeric complex since uncleaved gp160 is inefficiently incorporated
into virions (Bosch and Pawlita, 1990<a href = "#ref08"><sup><strong>08</strong></sup></a>, Dubay et al., 1995<a href = "#ref27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup></a>).  A
post-cleavage conformational change is consistent with studies on
influenza virus, where, in the crystal structure of the cleaved
hemagglutinin, the C-terminus of HA1(SU) and the N-terminus of HA2(TM)
are separated by 21   (Wilson et al., 1981<a href = "#ref127"><sup><strong>127</strong></sup></a>).  In the case of HIV Env,
gp120 and gp41 are non-covalently associated following cleavage of the
precursor.  It can be concluded from an analysis of mutant glycoproteins
that residues within conserved regions (C1 and C5) at the N-terminus and
at the C-terminus of gp120 play a key role in this association (Helseth
et al., 1991<a href = "#ref53"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup></a>).  In gp41, a region (residues 528-562) immediately
carboxy-terminal to the fusion peptide is important for this association,
although mutations outside this region can also be disruptive (Cao et
al., 1993<a href = "#ref10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a>).
<br>
	It is important to emphasize that the stable oligomeric structure, which
forms in the ER, is folded from uncleaved polyprotein precursors. This
clearly allows the folding of regions of both SU and TM into domains that
are structurally constrained in a manner that would be impossible if they
were assembled from the mature proteins, gp120 and gp41 (see below).  If
one considers the folding of this constrained structure as the setting of
a spring-loaded trap, cleavage of the precursor might then be analogous
to the removal of the safety catch. 
<p>
<strong><font size="+2">Immune Responses to gp41</font></strong>
<p>
	Although the bulk of gp41 might be expected to be sequestered from the
humoral immune system within the Env oligomeric complex, several regions
of this molecule are recognized by sera from individuals infected with
HIV.  The first of these regions, often referred to as Cluster I extends
from around residue 588 to residue 615 of gp41.  The immunodominant
epitope is centered around a short disulfide-bonded loop (residues
607-613) that is located within the central region of the gp41 ectodomain
(1987b<a href = "#ref48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup></a>, Gnann et al., 1987c<a href = "#ref49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup></a>).  Almost all sera from infected individuals
react with this epitope even though some sequence diversity has been
found in viruses of the O-subtype (Eberle et al., 1997<a href = "#ref32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup></a>).  Nevertheless,
antibodies to this epitope are not neutralizing and do not block
infection by HIV.  On the contrary, monoclonal antibodies reactive with
this region have been reported to enhance infection through a
complement-dependent mechanism (Robinson et al., 1990a<a href = "#ref88"><sup><strong>88</strong></sup></a> Robinson et al.,
1990b<a href = "#ref89"><sup><strong>89</strong></sup></a>).  The immunologically active form of the seven-residue peptide,
CSGKLIC, contains an intramolecular disulfide bond and NMR studies showed
that this domain maintains a preference for a folded conformation,
including a type I reverse turn about the residues SGKL. The presence of
the disulfide bond is integral to the formation of the structure of the
loop in solution. Mutations (Cys to Ser) which eliminate the possibility
of loop formation result in the failure of antibody binding to this
peptide (Oldstone et al., 1991<a href = "#ref81"><sup><strong>81</strong></sup></a>).
<br>
	In addition to this primary immunodominant epitope, a second ectodomain
region, located proximal to the membrane-spanning region of gp41, is also
recognized by sera from infected individuals (Cluster II; Horal et al.,
1991<a href = "#ref55"><sup><strong>55</strong></sup></a> Xu et al., 1991<a href = "#ref128"><sup><strong>128</strong></sup></a>).  While a majority of antibodies reactive with
this region do not neutralize HIV infection, one human monoclonal
antibody (2F5) has been identified that neutralizes a variety of
laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1. The amino acid
sequence ELDKWA (residues 671-676) has been defined as the epitope
recognized by this antibody (Muster et al., 1993<a href = "#ref79"><sup><strong>79</strong></sup></a>). Sequence analysis of a
variety of primary isolates suggests that the major determinant of MAb
2F5 binding corresponds to the amino-acid sequence LDKW, since naturally
occurring and in vitro selected neutralization-resistant viruses contain
changes in the D and K positions of the ELDKWA motif (Purtscher et al.,
1996<a href = "#ref85"><sup><strong>85</strong></sup></a>).  While 2F5 recognizes a putatively linear determinant present on
short peptides, it seems likely that the epitope reflects a specific
conformation of the contributing amino acids, since attempts to elicit
neutralizing antibodies to a synthetic peptide encompassing this region
or to the epitope presented on the hepatitis B surface antigen have been
unsuccessful (Eckhart et al., 1996<a href = "#ref33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup></a>).  However, insertion of this epitope
into the loop of antigenic site B of the influenza virus
hemagglutinin did elicit ELDKWA-specific, neutralizing immunoglobulins in
antisera of mice (Muster et al., 1994<a href = "#ref78"><sup><strong>78</strong></sup></a>).  The mechanism of neutralization
is not understood, although Neurath and colleagues have reported multiple
effects of binding the 2F5 monoclonal antibody to virions that are
suggestive of post-binding conformational changes in Env (Neurath et al.,
1995<a href = "#ref80"><sup><strong>80</strong></sup></a>).  It is also relevant that the 2F5 epitope overlaps the amino acid
sequence of a peptide derived from gp41 that is a potent inhibitor of
fusion (see below) and a tryptophan-rich region that we have recently
shown plays a critical role in fusion and infectivity (Salzwedel and
Hunter, unpublished).
<br>
	An enigma, as far as anti-gp41 neutralizing antibodies are concerned,
has been the fact that monoclonal antibodies raised against a hydrophilic
peptide corresponding to residues 743-760 (DRPEGIEEEGGERDRDRS) of the
cytoplasmic domain could neutralize a variety of HIV-1 isolates. Both
monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera raised against this epitope
have neutralizing potential (Dalgleish et al., 1988,<a href = "#ref21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup></a> Evans et al.,
1989<a href = "#ref39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup></a>).  There is currently no evidence that this region of the
cytoplasmic domain can be translocated to the outer surface of the cell
and so how such antibodies can neutralize has remained a puzzle.  Recent
experiments, however, indicate that a monoclonal antibody to this epitope
can bind with equal efficiency to infected and uninfected cells
(Sattentau et al., 1995<a href = "#ref95"><sup><strong>95</strong></sup></a>), suggesting that the epitope is also present on
a cell surface protein.  Since it is clear that the lipid envelope of HIV
incorporates a large number of cell surface proteins (Arthur et al.,
1992<a href = "#ref03"><sup><strong>03</strong></sup></a>), it is possible that neutralization by antibodies to this epitope
is mediated through one of these cell-derived molecules.
<br>
	The TM protein also elicits activity from the cellular arm of the immune
response.  One of the CTL epitopes, identified through the use of
synthetic peptides and fusion proteins carrying portions of the HIV-1 env
gene, overlaps with the immunodominant B-cell epitope (amino acids
591-602 of the most-likely HIV env sequence - AVERYLKDQQLL). Only two
positions within this epitope showed variation among North American HIV-1
isolates, and the substitutions were conservative in nature (Johnson et
al., 1992<a href = "#ref59"><sup><strong>59</strong></sup></a>). Interestingly, a Lys to Arg substitution at position 597
abolished recognition, probably by interfering with the peptide-MHC
interactions (Dai et al., 1992,<a href = "#ref20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup></a> Hammond et al., 1991<a href = "#ref51"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup></a>).  In additional
studies, CTL from four subjects recognized at least three distinct
epitopes in this region of gp41 in the context of the MHC class 1 alleles
A24, B8, B14, and B27 (Shankar et al., 1996<a href = "#ref101"><sup><strong>101</strong></sup></a>). The other region of gp41
recognized by CTL is a stretch of 20 amino acids at the C-terminus of the
cytoplasmic domain. CTL from seven subjects recognized epitopes within
this region that were restricted by A30, B7, B8 and B35 class 1 alleles
(Shankar et al., 1996<a href = "#ref101"><sup><strong>101</strong></sup></a>).

Several enveloped viruses including influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis
virus, and the alpha-viruses require the acidic environment of the
endosome to activate the fusogenic potential of their envelope
glycoprotein complexes.  Thus after binding a receptor molecule on the
cell surface, they are taken up into coated pits, undergo endocytosis and
then release their replicative machinery into the cell following fusion
with the endosomal membrane.  In contrast the entry of HIV is not
dependent on exposure to an acidic environment (McClure et al., 1988,<a href = "#ref70"><sup><strong>70</strong></sup></a>,
Sinangil et al., 1988,<a href = "#ref103"><sup><strong>103</strong></sup></a> Stein et al., 1987<a href = "#ref107"><sup><strong>107</strong></sup></a>).
<br>
It is known, for the hemagglutinin of influenza virus and the
glycoprotein complex of Semliki Forest virus, that the acid environment
of the endosomal compartment induces a conformational change in the
proteins that is necessary for activation of the fusion process (reviewed
in White et al., 198,<a href = "#ref118"><sup><strong>118</strong></sup></a> White, 1992<a href = "#ref119"><sup><strong>119</strong></sup></a>).  In the case of HIV, and SIV
analogous conformational changes have been observed following binding of
receptor molecules (Sattentau and Moore, 1991,<a href = "#ref94"><sup><strong>94</strong></sup></a> Sattentau et al., 1993<a href = "#ref95"><sup><strong>95</strong></sup></a>),
and recent experiments suggest that these receptor-induced conformation
changes may parallel in molecular terms those induced by acid pH in the
influenza virus HA.
<br>
Initially, experiments aimed at defining the mechanism by which a soluble
form of the HIV receptor (sCD4) neutralized the infectivity of HIV
demonstrated that treatment of laboratory strains of this virus with sCD4
could induce rapid shedding of gp120 and loss of the characteristic
surface spikes seen in EMs of virions (Kirsh et al., 1990,<a href = "#ref63"><sup><strong>63</strong></sup></a> Moore et al.,
1990<a href = "#ref77"><sup><strong>77</strong></sup></a>).  Dissociation was temperature dependent and no significant
dissociation of gp120 was observed between 4&#176  and 16&#176   (Hart et al.,
1991<a href = "#ref52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup></a> Moore and Klasse, 1992,<a href = "#ref745"><sup><strong>74</strong></sup></a> Moore et al., 1991,<a href = "#ref76"><sup><strong>76</strong></sup></a> Sattentau and Moore,
1991<a href = "#ref94"><sup><strong>94</strong></sup></a>).  
<br>
In the case of influenza virus HA, brief treatment of the virus with low
pH, which activates fusion, results in the exposure of antigenic epitopes
and protease cleavage sites that are normally sequestered within the HA
molecule (Daniels et al., 1983,<a href = "#ref22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup></a> Skehel et al., 1982<a href = "#ref104"><sup><strong>104</strong></sup></a> White et al.,
1983<a href = "#ref118"><sup><strong>118</strong></sup></a>).  Similarly, dissociation of gp120 by CD4 is accompanied by
exposure of epitopes on gp41 that are not reactive in the native molecule
(Hart et al., 1991,<a href = "#ref52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup></a> Sattentau and Moore, 1991<a href = "#ref94"><sup><strong>94</strong></sup></a>).  Epitope exposure is not
dependent upon loss of gp120 since similar results were obtained
following CD4 binding at 4&#176  (Sattentau and Moore, 1991,<a href = "#ref94"><sup><strong>94</strong></sup></a> Sattentau et
al., 1995<a href = "#ref97"><sup><strong>97</strong></sup></a>). A majority of studies have employed sCD4 treatment of HIV
virions or infected cells, but Sattentau and Moore (1993) have
demonstrated a similar exposure of gp41 epitopes at the interface of
fusing cells.  Thus membrane anchored CD4, like sCD4, can induce gp41
epitope exposure following gp120 binding.  
<br>
The exposure of epitopes in both TM and SU, coupled with the dissociation
of gp120 that has been observed with laboratory adapted isolates of
HIV-1, appears to represent the most dramatic effect of sCD4 on Env
conformation and may reflect the relative instability of the glycoprotein
complexes of these isolates.  The susceptibility of primary isolates of
HIV-1 to sCD4 neutralization is significantly lower than that of
cell-line adapted isolates (Daar et al., 1990<a href = "#ref19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup></a>) and sCD4 is very
inefficient at inducing gp120 dissociation in the non-adapted strains
(Moore et al., 1992<a href = "#ref74"><sup><strong>74</strong></sup></a>), perhaps reflecting the lower affinity for CD4
exhibited by the oligomeric form of Env from natural isolates (Moore et
al., 1992<a href = "#ref74"><sup><strong>74</strong></sup></a>).
<br>
The glycoproteins of HIV-2 and SIV also have a lower affinity for CD4 and
these viruses are similarly resistant to neutralization by sCD4.  In
contrast to the laboratory adapted strains of HIV-1, both SIV and HIV-2
infection and syncytium formation can be enhanced by sub-inhibitory
concentrations of the soluble receptor. Incubation of sCD4 with SIVagm
viruses not only accelerates the kinetics of infection but also leads to
a 100-fold increase in the titer of the virus (Allan et al., 1990,<a href = "#ref01"><sup><strong>01</strong></sup></a>
Clapham et al., 1991,<a href = "#ref17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup></a> Sekigawa et al., 1990<a href = "#ref100"><sup><strong>100</strong></sup></a> Werner et al., 1990<a href = "#ref117"><sup><strong>117</strong></sup></a>).  A
similar enhancement of infectivity has recently been observed with HIV-1
when poorly neutralizable primary isolates are treated with
sub-inhibitory concentrations of sCD4 (Sullivan et al., 1995<a href = "#ref108"><sup><strong>108</strong></sup></a>).  Treatment
of SIV or HIV-2 infected cells with the soluble receptor does not result
in dissociation of gp120 or increased exposure of TM epitopes -
apparently as a consequence of stronger interactions between the subunits
in these viruses (Allan et al., 1992,<a href = "#ref02"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a> Sattentau et al., 1993<a href = "#ref96"><sup><strong>96</strong></sup></a>). 
Nevertheless, it does result in some conformational changes, since an
increase was observed in the exposure of the V2 and V3 loops, as detected
by antibody binding (Sattentau et al., 1993<a href = "#ref96"><sup><strong>96</strong></sup></a>), and antibodies from SIVagm
infected monkeys, which failed to neutralize virus in vitro, could
neutralize the sCD4-induced enhancement of SIVagm infection (Allan et
al., 1990<a href = "#ref01"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>).  This is consistent with the suggestion that sCD4 enhancement
of SIVagm (and presumably of HIV-1 primary isolates and HIV-2) is a form
of receptor mediated activation (Allan et al., 1990<a href = "#ref01"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>), analogous to the
low-pH activation observed with influenza virus or Semliki Forest virus
(Marsh and Helenius, 1989<a href = "#ref69"><sup><strong>69</strong></sup></a>).  
<p>
<strong>b) Molecular rearrangements following receptor binding - formation of
coiled-coils</strong>
<br>
Both crystallographic and peptide studies with influenza virus have shown
that the low pH-mediated conformational changes that occur in HA involve
the structural transition of a region within the HA2 (TM) protein. Thus
residues C-terminal to the fusion peptide, that are constrained as an
extended polypeptide chain within the inactive HA, form an elongated
helical structure following low pH activation (Bullough et al., 1994,<a href = "#ref09"><sup><strong>09</strong></sup></a>
Carr and Kim, 1993<a href = "#ref11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a>).  The newly formed helices of the HA trimer form a
triple-helix, coiled-coil structure that is postulated to position the
fusion peptide, located at the N-terminus of HA2, for insertion into the
target cell membrane.  A heptad repeat (leucine-zipper-like) region
capable of forming a similar coiled-coil structure is found within the
N-terminal 100 amino acids of the TM protein of a majority of
retroviruses.  Peptides corresponding to this domain form stable
coiled-coil structures (Wild et al., 1992<a href = "#ref123"><sup><strong>123</strong></sup></a>) and fusion of the heptad
repeat to the C-terminus of a monomeric form of bacterial protein-A or
maltose-binding protein results in assembly of oligomeric chimeric
proteins (Bernstein et al., 1995,<a href = "#ref05"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> Shugars et al., 1996<a href = "#ref102"><sup><strong>102</strong></sup></a>).  Thus this
region has the capability to both oligomerize and mediate oligomerization
of protein molecules.  The heptad repeat domain is highly conserved among
HIV-1 isolates and was originally postulated to play a role in the
assembly oligomerization of the glycoprotein complex that occurs in the
ER (Delwart and Mosialos, 1990,<a href = "#ref24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup></a> Gallaher et al., 1989<a href = "#ref46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup></a>).  Mutational
analyses of the region have argued against a direct role in oligomer
assembly in the ER but showed that even minor amino acid substitutions
had dramatic effects on the biological activity of the HIV-1
glycoprotein, by blocking cell-cell fusion and virus infectivity (Chen,
1994,<a href = "#ref15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup></a> Chen et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup></a> Dubay et al., 1992<a href = "#ref28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup></a>).  Peptides corresponding to
this region are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 induced cell fusion as well as
virus infection, and this property correlates directly with the ability
of the peptides to form stable coiled-coil structures; the same mutations
which block the biological function of Env also reduce the melting
temperature of the peptide's coiled-coil structure as well as abrogate
their inhibitory potential (Wild et al., 1994b<a href = "#ref120"><sup><strong>120</strong></sup></a>).  We have postulated
therefore that binding of CD4 to gp120 might induce equivalent
conformational changes to that seen during low pH treatment of the
influenza virus HA, with the resulting formation of an extended
coiled-coil that can present the N-terminal fusion peptide to the target
cell membrane (Figure 2A and 2B) (Bernstein et al., 1995,<a href = "#ref05"><sup><strong>05</strong></sup></a> Wild et al.,
1994b<a href = "#ref120"><sup><strong>120</strong></sup></a>).  Such a mechanism would explain why mutations which prevent
cleavage of the Env precursor effectively block fusion, since in the
absence of a free amino-terminus, the fusion peptide would be unable to
undergo such a dramatic displacement.

The fusion peptide can thus be moved approximately 100Å.</font>
<p>
<strong>c) Insertion of the fusion peptide</strong>
<br>
While the formation of a coiled-coil structure might present the fusion
peptide to the target cell membrane, the mechanism of action of the
fusion peptide itself remains obscure.  How, for example, does the
amino-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 interact with the membrane and what
molecular interactions must occur following insertion?  Mutational
analyses of the fusion peptides of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, which show
sequence homology to the fusion peptides of the paramyxoviruses
(Gallaher, 1987<a href = "#ref45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup></a>), have demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic
residues within this region; substitution of hydrophobic with hydrophilic
residues reduces syncytium formation and virus infectivity, whereas
enhancement of hydrophobicity increases both (Bosch et al., 1989,<a href = "#ref07"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a> Freed
and Myers, 1992,<a href = "#ref42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup></a> Freed et al., 1990,<a href = "#ref43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup></a> Steffy et al., 1992<a href = "#ref106"><sup><strong>106</strong></sup></a>).  Recent NMR
analyses of the gp41 fusion domain indicated that a peptide corresponding
to this region inserts into lipid micelles primarily as a helix (59%),
with substantial beta-structure (26.7%). Fluorescence experiments with a
tryptophan analogue of the peptide pointed to deep penetration of the
peptide into the apolar hydrocarbon core.  The region C-terminal to an
alanine-15/glycine-16 flexible hinge interacts in a substantial way with
the micelle, suggesting that it lies on the surface of the bilayer (Chang
et al., 1997<a href = "#ref13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a>).  Despite this data, it is still not clear if, in order to
function during virus entry, the fusion peptide interacts only with lipid
or whether it also interacts with membrane-associated proteins in a
manner analogous to the signal peptides of secreted and membrane-spanning
proteins.
<p>
<strong>d) Structural analyses of gp41: implications for the fusion process</strong>
<br>
Although the three-dimensional crystal structure of the influenza virus
HA was established over 15 years ago (Wilson et al., 1981<a href = "#ref127"><sup><strong>127</strong></sup></a>), similar
attempts to determine the structure of the intact Env complex of HIV have
been unsuccessful.  Using the known structure of HA2 and
structure-prediction algorithms, Gallaher (1989) proposed a secondary
structure for the HIV TM that included a number of structural motifs
common to the TMs of diverse retroviral isolates.  While this model has
been conceptually valuable, protein-structure prediction remains
unreliable, particularly for membrane proteins, and, more importantly, it
fails to take into account the potential for formation of intermediate,
quasi-stable structures such as those observed in HA.  Within the past
two years, however, significant progress has been made in obtaining
high-resolution structure information on the fusion-active form of the
HIV TM.  
<br>
Following expression of the ectodomain of gp41 in bacteria, the insoluble
product could be converted to a soluble form through limited
proteolysis.  This generated two peptide fragments N51 and C43, derived
from the N- and C-regions of the gp41 ectodomain respectively (Lu et al.,
1995<a href = "#ref68"><sup><strong>68</strong></sup></a>).  The N51 peptide corresponds to the 4-3 heptad repeat region
(residues 549-599) discussed previously, while the C43 peptide is derived
from a C-terminal potentially helical region (residues 633-675). 
Biophysical studies showed that these two peptides associate to form a
highly thermostable, helical, trimeric complex of heterotrimers in which
the N51 and C34 helices are arranged in an anti-parallel fashion (Figure
3A; Lu et al., 1995).  An almost identical, antiparallel, coiled-coil
bundle could be isolated using the same approach with the SIV TM
ectodomain (Blacklow et al., 1995<a href = "#ref06"><sup><strong>06</strong></sup></a>).  This provided the initial indication
that the N- and C-terminal regions of TM can fold back onto themselves to
form a stable, predominantly helical, complex.  While these helical
bundles lacked the interconnecting 33 amino acid region containing the
immunodominant epitope (residues 600-632), expression of the intact gp41
ectodomain (minus the fusion peptide) in insect cells yielded soluble
oligomeric (trimer) proteins that appear in the electron microscope to
form similar rod-like structures and which by circular dichroism have
high alpha-helical content (~80%) (Weissenhorn et al., 1996<a href = "#ref116"><sup><strong>116</strong></sup></a>).  Thus the
presence of the cysteine-loop region does not appear to interfere with
the anti-parallel packing of the N- and C-terminal helices.

<p>
In the past year, two groups have succeeded in obtaining high resolution
crystallographic data on the helical bundle formed by the N- and
C-terminal domains of gp41.  Chan et al. (1997) determined the structure
of a slightly smaller complex, N36 (residues 555-590)/C34 (residues
637-670), to 2.0 &#197  resolution.  This complex is a six-stranded helical
bundle (fig 3B).  The center of the bundle consists of a trimeric
coiled-coil of three N36 helices arranged in parallel in a left-handed
super helix.  Three C34 helices are wrapped, antiparallel to the N36
helices, in a left-handed direction around the central coiled-coil trimer
(Fig 3C).  Overall the complex comprises a cylinder that is 35 &#197  in
diameter and 55 &#197  in height.  Using a somewhat different approach,
Weissenhorn et al. (1997) determined the structure of the
protease-resistant part of the gp41 ectodomain solubilized with a
trimeric GCN4 coiled-coil in place of the amino-terminal fusion peptide.
This structure, in which gp41 residues 550-597 form the triple-stranded
alpha-helical coiled-coil core and residues 637-674 form the
alpha-helices packed in the reverse direction against the outside of the
coiled coil, is essentially identical to that of Chan et al. (1997).  The
C-terminal helices interact with the central coiled-coil core mainly
through hydrophobic residues that are located in three grooves on its
surface and the residues lining these grooves are highly conserved
between HIV and SIV.  It is important to note that peptides corresponding
to the C-terminal helices do not have helical character in solution (Wild
et al., 1995,<a href = "#ref122"><sup><strong>122</strong></sup></a> Wild et al., 1994a<a href = "#ref124"><sup><strong>124</strong></sup></a>) and so the formation and stability of
these helices must depend to a large extent on their interaction with the
triple-stranded central core.  Indeed, it is quite possible that within
the native Env complex on the virion, both the N-terminal heptad repeat
region and the C-terminal domain are constrained as extended polypeptide
chains, and that their transition to helical structure occurs only after
receptor binding.
<br>
The trimeric coiled-coil complex has implications for the valency of the
Env complex itself, for the structural rearrangements of Env involved in
membrane fusion and for the development of novel antiretroviral drugs. 
The HIV Env complex has been  described as a tetramer and as a dimer of
dimers (Earl et al., 1990,<a href = "#ref30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup></a> Pinter et al., 1989,<a href = "#ref84"><sup><strong>84</strong></sup></a> Schawaller et al., 1989<a href = "#ref99"><sup><strong>99</strong></sup></a>)
as well as a trimer (Gelderblom et al., 1987,<a href = "#ref47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup></a> Weiss et al., 1990<a href = "#ref113"><sup><strong>113</strong></sup></a>).  The
trimeric nature of the gp41 coiled-coil complex, even though it is formed
in the absence of gp120, clearly suggests that the native Env complex is
also trimeric.  This would be consistent with other retroviral Env
complexes (Einfeld and Hunter, 1988,<a href = "#ref35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup></a> Einfeld and Hunter, 1990,<a href = "#ref36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup></a> Kamps et
al., 1991<a href = "#ref61"><sup><strong>61</strong></sup></a>) and with the influenza virus HA (Wilson et al., 1981<a href = "#ref127"><sup><strong>127</strong></sup></a>).
<br>
The remarkable structural similarity of the HIV gp41 coiled-coil bundle
to the fusion pH-induced conformation of influenza virus HA2 (Bullough et
al., 1994<a href = "#ref09"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>) and to the transmembrane subunit of Moloney murine leukemia
virus (Fass et al., 1997<a href = "#ref40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup></a>) led both Chan et al. (1997) and Weissenhorn et
al. (1997) to propose that this structure represents the fusion-active
form of the gp41 ectodomain.  A number of factors support this
conclusion.  First the coiled-coil bundle is very thermostable, in
contrast to the native Env complex, indicative of a terminal low energy
conformation.  Second, mutations that block fusion and infectivity map to
residues that stabilize the coiled-coil bundle.  For example the
isoleucine at position 582, which we have shown is critical for fusion
and for stability of the core triple helix (Wild et al., 1994b<a href = "#ref120"><sup><strong>120</strong></sup></a>), makes a
homotrimeric contact at the center of the coiled coil but also interacts
with Trp640 in the outer helix .  Similarly, Asn665 is in an a position
(relative to the a-g positions of a heptad repeat) on the outer helix and
packs into the groove on the central core.  Mutation of this residue
would be predicted to disrupt an extensive hydrogen bonding network that
stabilizes the outer helix and, as might be expected if this were the
case, abrogates fusion (Cao et al., 1993<a href = "#ref10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a>).  Finally peptides
corresponding to the N- and C-terminal helical domains that make up the
coiled-coil bundle have potent anti-viral activity and block HIV fusion
(Jiang et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref58"><sup><strong>58</strong></sup></a> Lu et al., 1995,<a href = "#ref68"><sup><strong>68</strong></sup></a> 1994b; Wild et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref121"><sup><strong>121</strong></sup></a> 1994a<a href = "#ref124"><sup><strong>124</strong></sup></a>).
Given the stability of the coiled-coil structure, these peptides would
not be expected to exert their antiviral effect once it has formed. In
contrast, the structure supports the concept that the inhibitory peptides
function by interacting with gp41 during the conformational changes to
the fusion-active state.  Thus the N-terminal peptides might block the
formation of the internal coiled-coil or interact (as oligomeric
peptides) with the C-terminal region, preventing its interaction with the
N-terminal domain.  C-terminal peptides might act competitively to
prevent binding of this region of gp41 into the grooves of the central
core.  Indeed, a peptide comprising residues 647-682 (DP178) can bind to
a bacterially produced gp41 ectodomain that has been deleted in this
region.  Moreover, the formation of this ``molecular clasp'' reconstituted
an epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody prepared against the
intact ectodomain of gp41 (Chen et al., 1995<a href = "#ref14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup></a>).
<br>
Taken together with the high resolution structural information, the data
from mutations and inhibitory peptides points to a model for Env-induced
fusion which involves two interdependent conformational changes in gp41
(Fig 4).  In the first stage, following binding of the receptor complex,
the constrained N-terminal heptad-repeat region of gp41 would be freed to
assemble into the central coiled-coil, moving the fusion peptide in the
process to a position where it could interact with the target cell
membrane.  The second stage would then be the formation of the
coiled-coil bundle.  Since this latter structure is arranged such that
the N-terminal fusion peptide and the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain
of gp41 are at the same end of the bundle, its formation would force the
target cell membrane and the viral membrane in close proximity.  This
mechanical process thus might facilitate the initiation of the process
where lipid mixing occurs.  Neither the source of energy for the second
conformational change and membrane apposition, which would be expected to
have a high DG, nor the time frame over which such a process might occur
is obvious.  However, the fact that peptides such as DP178 can inhibit
the fusion process at very low concentrations (pM), suggests that the
formation of the coiled-coil bundle might be a rate limiting step in
fusion.
<p>
<strong>e) gp41/fusion as an anti-viral target</strong>
<br> 

It is clear from the work of several groups that peptides corresponding
to the N-terminal heptad repeat (DP107) and the C-terminal helical domain
(DP178, C34) represent potent inhibitors of HIV-1 entry and replication
(Jiang et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref58"><sup><strong>58</strong></sup></a> Lu et al., 1995,<a href = "#ref68"><sup><strong>68</strong></sup></a> 1994b; Wild et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref121"><sup><strong>121</strong></sup></a> 1994a<a href = "#ref124"><sup><strong>124</strong></sup></a>). 
The possible mechanism of action of these peptides is discussed above and
suggests that the conformational changes in gp41 are a novel target for
anti-HIV therapeutics.  A particularly important development of this
concept, therefore, has been the initial clinical trial of the C-terminal
(DP178) peptide in HIV-1 infected patients.  In this study, 5 of 5
patients, receiving 100mg of the peptide twice daily for a period of 17
days, showed greater than 100-fold reductions in viral load (Saag et al.,
1997<a href = "#ref92"><sup><strong>92</strong></sup></a>) - an anti-viral effect greater than several RT inhibitors.  Thus it
appears that the fusion/entry process is a viable in vivo therapeutic
target.  The presence of the highly conserved, deep cavities on the
N-terminal coiled-coil trimer with which conserved C-terminal residues
interact, raises the possibility that novel small molecule or
peptidomimetic inhibitors of HIV infection might be developed (Chan et
al., 1997,<a href = "#ref12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a> Weissenhorn et al., 1997<a href = "#ref115"><sup><strong>115</strong></sup></a>).
<p>
<strong>f) Requirement for a membrane anchor</strong>
<br>
The membrane-spanning anchor region of the TM protein is an important
structural domain, as might be expected if the initial result of fusion
peptide insertion is an oligomeric structure that acts as a bridge
between the viral and cell membranes.  The region of gp41 that spans the
membrane to yield a fusion-active form of the HIV-1 Env remains
ill-defined, but C-terminal truncations indicate residues 692-716 can
function as a membrane anchor (Dubay et al., 1992,<a href = "#ref28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup></a> Helseth et al., 1990,<a href = "#ref54"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup></a>
Johnston et al., 1993<a href = "#ref60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup></a>).  Point mutations and small deletion mutations
within this region can abrogate fusion without affecting the
membrane-anchor function (Helseth et al., 1990,<a href = "#ref54"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup></a> Owens et al., 1994<a href = "#ref60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup></a>). 
Nevertheless, because the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains of
the HIV-1 glycoprotein can be replaced by those of CD4 or CD28 without
loss of fusogenicity (Vincent et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref112"><sup><strong>112</strong></sup></a> Wilk et al., 1996<a href = "#ref126"><sup><strong>126</strong></sup></a>), there
appears to be no requirement for a specific amino acid sequence within
the transmembrane domain for Env to mediate the fusion reaction.  In
contrast, substitution of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor for
the HIV-1 protein anchor abrogates fusion and infectivity, even though
this GPI-linked protein is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane
and incorporated into virions (Salzwedel et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref93"><sup><strong>93</strong></sup></a> Weiss and White,
1993<a href = "#ref114"><sup><strong>114</strong></sup></a>).  A similar result has been reported for a GPI-linked form of the
influenza virus HA protein, although in this case lipid mixing of the
outer leaflet of the bilayer (hemi-fusion) was seen in the absence of
complete fusion and mixing of cell contents (Kemble et al., 1994<a href = "#ref62"><sup><strong>62</strong></sup></a>).  Thus
a protein component that spans both leaflets of the lipid bilayer appears
to be critical for complete mixing of the viral and target membranes. 
Weissenhorn et al. (1997) have suggested that the rod-shaped gp41
coiled-coil bundles might cluster at their hydrophobic tips (which
includes the membrane-spanning domain), thereby forming asters with
centers that could be the points of initial membrane fusion.

<strong><font size = "+2">Role of the HIV/SIV Cytoplasmic Domain</font></strong>
<br>
The TM proteins of lentiviruses have unusually long cytoplasmic domains. 
In HIV and SIV they exceed 150 amino acids and in the case of Visna virus
it is more than 200 amino acids in length.  This contrasts with most
retroviral TMs where the cytoplasmic domain ranges from 20-40 amino acids
(Hunter and Swanstrom, 1990<a href = "#ref57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup></a>).  In an attempt to define the biological
role of the additional residues in the cytoplasmic domain, several
investigators have introduced premature termination codons in both the
HIV-1 and SIV Env coding sequence to progressively truncate the
cytoplasmic domain.  The results of these experiments indicate that the
cytoplasmic domain is dispensable for HIV or SIV Env-mediated cell-cell
fusion.  In the case of HIV-1, however, truncation of the cytoplasmic
domain by as few as 20 amino acids results in significantly decreased
virus replication in most cell types, although the virus is still viable
in the highly permissive MT4 cell line (Dubay et al., 1992,<a href = "#ref27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup></a> Freed and
Martin, 1995,<a href = "#ref41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup></a> Gabuzda et al., 1992,<a href = "#ref44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup></a> Wilk et al., 1992<a href = "#ref125"><sup><strong>125</strong></sup></a>).  SIV replication,
in contrast, appears to have no requirement for the cytoplasmic domain of
Env (Johnston et al., 1993,<a href = "#ref60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup></a> Zingler and Littman, 1993<a href = "#ref129"><sup><strong>129</strong></sup></a>).  Indeed growth of
SIV in human cells results in the selection for a viral Env with a
spontaneous truncation which broadens the host range of the virus,
probably by increasing the number of Env molecules incorporated into
virions (Johnston et al., 1993<a href = "#ref60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup></a>) (Zingler and Littman, 1993<a href = "#ref129"><sup><strong>129</strong></sup></a>). 
Nevertheless, reversion back to wild-type virus has been observed
following inoculation of virus encoding the Env truncation into macaques,
suggesting that in vivo this region plays an important role (P. Luciw,
personal communication; Kodama et al., 1989<a href = "#ref64"><sup><strong>64</strong></sup></a>).  A number of structural
elements within the cytoplasmic domain may contribute to this in vivo
function.
<p>
<strong><font size = "+2">Endocytosis/Basolateral Targeting Signals</font></strong>
<br>
Cytoplasmic amino-acid motifs can function to direct endocytosis of a
protein from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Trowbridge et al., 1993<a href = "#ref111"><sup><strong>111</strong></sup></a>).
Over the past few years, the sequences of these internalization/targeting
signals have been identified for several constitutively reycling cell
surface receptors and have been shown to involve tyrosine residues within
a tight turn of the peptide backbone (Robinson et al., 1996,<a href = "#ref87"><sup><strong>87</strong></sup></a> Trowbridge
et al., 1993<a href = "#ref111"><sup><strong>111</strong></sup></a>).  For the transferrin receptor (TR) this sequence is
Tyr-X-Arg-Phe and a general consensus for this type of internalization
motif is Tyr -X-Arg/Lys-Y, where Y is usually a hydrophobic amino acid
(Collawn et al., 1990<a href = "#ref18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup></a>). We noted previously (Hunter, 1994) that a
majority of retroviral cytoplasmic domains contained a similar motif.  In
HIV and SIV, a Tyr-X-Pro-Leu/Val sequence, located membrane-proximally
(residues 721-724) within the cytoplasmic domain, is highly conserved. 
Hoxie and colleagues have described a spontaneous mutant of an SIV Env
protein in which the tyrosine in this motif was substituted by a
cysteine.  This mutant was poorly endocytosed, and was expressed on the
cell surface and incorporated into virions at high levels (LaBranche et
al., 1995,<a href = "#ref65"><sup><strong>65</strong></sup></a> Sauter et al., 1996<a href = "#ref98"><sup><strong>98</strong></sup></a>).  Similarly, Siliciano and colleagues have
shown that this tyrosine containing motif is important for efficient
endocytosis of the HIV-1 Env molecule (Rowell et al., 1995<a href = "#ref91"><sup><strong>91</strong></sup></a>). 
Additionally, Sauter et al. (1996) were able to demonstrate directly the
role of the SIV motif in endocytosis by substituting the cytoplasmic
domain of Env for that of CD4.
<br>
What is the rationale for conserving signals that result in the
internalization and degradation of a protein that must be incorporated
into virions for infectivity?  It has been proposed that this process
might reduce immunological recognition of infected cells; alternatively,
the motifs might play a role in correct intracellular targeting.  In
epithelial cells, where the apical and basolateral membranes have
distinct protein populations, retroviral glycoproteins are specifically
targeted to the basolateral surface (Roth et al., 1983<a href = "#ref90"><sup><strong>90</strong></sup></a>).  When HIV-1 Gag
and Env are co-expressed in epithelial cells, it is at this surface that
virus assembly and release occurs (Lodge et al., 1994,<a href = "#ref66"><sup><strong>66</strong></sup></a> Owens et al.,
1991<a href = "#ref83"><sup><strong>83</strong></sup></a>). Mutation of the same tyrosine-containing motif that directs
endocytosis abrogates this basolateral targeting of HIV-1 Env and
basolateral assembly of virions (Lodge et al., 1997<a href = "#ref67"><sup><strong>67</strong></sup></a>). 
<br>
Interestingly, the rate of internalization of Env protein from the
surfaces of HIV-1-infected cells is slow, and the presence of the Pr55gag
precursor protein appears to be necessary and sufficient to inhibit Env
internalization (Egan et al., 1996<a href = "#ref34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup></a>).  Thus an interaction of the matrix
domain of the Gag protein with Env during assembly may preclude the
interaction of Env with host adaptin molecules that recruit plasma
membrane molecules into clathrin-coated pits and thereby effect
incorporation into virions.
<p>
<strong><font size = "+2">Calmodulin-binding domain</font></strong>
<br>
The cytoplasmic domains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV contain two regions that
would be predicted to fold into amphipathic helical segments which
closely resemble those found in calmodulin-activated enzymes.  Synthetic
peptides corresponding to these regions have been shown to bind to
calmodulin (CaM) with high affinity in the presence of calcium (Miller et
al., 1993,<a href = "#ref71"><sup><strong>71</strong></sup></a> Srinivas et al., 1993<a href = "#ref105"><sup><strong>105</strong></sup></a>). These amphipathic peptides inhibit
CaM-regulated activation of bovine brain phosphodiesterase in vitro, and
have also been shown to inhibit mitogen-induced lymphocyte activation, a
property shared by CaM antagonists. These properties are not an artifact
of peptides since purified HIV-1 gp160 as well as full-length gp41 binds
to CaM and expression of HIV Env in cells results in CaM co-localization
(Radding et al., 1996<a href = "#ref86"><sup><strong>86</strong></sup></a>).  Moreover, while CaM binding by the C-terminal
amphipathic helix is very sensitive to amino acid changes, the natural
variation found in this region of Env leaves CaM-binding intact (Tencza
et al., 1997,<a href = "#ref109"><sup><strong>109</strong></sup></a> Tencza et al., 1995<a href = "#ref110"><sup><strong>110</strong></sup></a>).  Since calmodulin is intimately
involved in the metabolism and functioning of T-cells, these studies
point to a novel mechanism of viral cytopathogenesis mediated by the
interaction of the HIV TM protein with cellular CaM, that could in turn
uncouple critical cellular signal transduction pathways (Miller et al.,
1993,<a href = "#ref71"><sup><strong>71</strong></sup></a> Srinivas et al., 1993<a href = "#ref105"><sup><strong>105</strong></sup></a>). 
<p>
<strong><font size = "+2">Conclusions</font></strong>
<p>
Despite the wealth of new information summarized above, much remains to
be learned about the role of gp41 in HIV/SIV replication and
pathogenesis.  The similarities between the HIV Env complex and the HA
oligomer of influenza virus has allowed functional extrapolations to be
drawn from the limited structural information obtained from bacterially
expressed proteins.  Nevertheless, even moderate resolution structural
data on the native Env complex would provide information critical to
understanding the extent of the conformational changes that have only
been inferred to-date.  High resolution three-dimensional structures of
the native molecule would clearly assist in the development of small
molecule inhibitors that could block the postulated conformational
changes in gp41 following receptor binding and would thus interfere with
the process of membrane fusion.

It seems likely that the long cytoplasmic domain of the lentiviruses
plays a key role in viral pathogenesis.  In SIV the cytoplasmic domain
can be truncated without affecting virus replication in vitro, yet the
conservation of endocytosis signals, CaM binding domains, as well as
structural elements that interact with the assembling capsid precursors,
suggests that this region might play multiple roles in both virus
replication and pathogenesis in vivo.  Experiments aimed at defining the
structure of the cytoplasmic domain and the cell-encoded molecules with
which it likely interacts could yield important information in this
regard.

The HIV/SIV TM protein provides an excellent example of how multiple,
complex functions can be packaged in a small molecule.  Although much has
been learned in the last few years about the function of gp41, even more
remains to be uncovered.  The next few years promise to yield exciting
new information both on it and the molecular events involved in
virus-cell membrane fusion.
