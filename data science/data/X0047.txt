<FONT size=+1>It started with Scotty. Scotty was the best small-boat sailor I ever knew. Back in the
early thirties we sailed Star class boats and frostbite dinghies week in and week out.
Scotty was Lamont Ferguson, an expatriate Scot and working journalist in New York
City. Scotty was also the very first and, at that time, only skier I knew. Moreover,
he had taken ski lessons in Switzerland and regaled us with the most fascinating
stories of skiing on the Wengernalp in the shadow of the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau
just across the valley from storied Murren, winter home of Arnold Lunn and
Kandahar. Scotty, back then, gave me two small Swiss patches from that area which
I still have, sewn on the breast pocket of an old anorak.<P>

It was no wonder then that, weekday winter evenings, four Manhattanites, namely
Scotty, Frank, out of Canada, John, best friend and also a sailor, and I could be
found riding the elevated section of the subway through the upper wilds of The
Bronx carrying wood skis with heel-clamp leather bindings and tonkin poles with
huge baskets, subject to the curious stares of other passengers. The last stop brought
us to Van Courtlandt Park where we spent hours on the most hilly sections of the
park’s golf course under Scotty’s tutelage attempting to learn the fine points of stem
turns and, the good Lord willing, stem christies.<P>

It wasn’t long before we began to wander further afield, meeting at 5 AM on
Saturdays for the long drive north on, usually, US 9 or the Boston Post Road. The
interstate highway system was not yet even a dream. Automobiles, at least ours,
were usually well ventilated, minimally enclosed with isinglass snap-on curtains to
fend off inclement weather. Tires were tubed and flats were frequent. We wended
our way through every middlesex, village and town to our various destinations
where we proceeded to skin or herringbone our way to the top of some hill so that
we could, prayerfully, ski down without too many tailspins. A few hours of skiing in
return for many hours of driving. A good tradeoff!<P>

One favorite destination was Bousquet’s, in Massachusetts. Claire Bousquet had
erected several rope tows in the mid-thirties and had devised a rope-tow gripper.
Taking hold of a wet rope had its sporting moments. The rope tended to slip through
one’s mittens we usually wore mittens in preference to gloves and then suddenly
grab the mitt, unceremoniously jolting the unwary rider forward out of his stance
and depositing him in a tangled heap in the middle of the track. Bousquet’s gripper
eliminated that embarrassment. I still have mine. Gripper, that is, not
embarrassment!<P>

Almost every winter weekend saw the four of us breaking out of office or classroom
on Friday evenings, itching to go. We had tightened the Lettner edges of our skis
and diligently applied base wax. We devoured every ski publication on the
newsstands and listened to Roxy Rothafel on the radio for the latest snow reports.
We were ready. Besides Bousquet’s we traipsed to the G-Bar-S Ranch and its
Forgotten Bridge Trail near Great Barrington, Mt. Greylock to ski the Thunderbolt,
albeit not very well, Farnam’s, Catamount and Jiminy Peak. These were all day trips
to Massachusetts. Ex-Marine, Walt Schoenknecht, had his Mohawk Mountain ski
area near Cornwall, Connecticut where he greeted all comers with a chalked
blackboard message, always ending with, "Good skiing, Walt." When, following
WWII, he developed Mount Snow in Vermont, we followed him there his first year.
His unpaved parking lot was sheet ice and it took much pushing to finally clear it
out at end of day. That first year, one could buy nearby property at $10 per acre.
Later, real estate agents were asking, or so it seemed, $10 per square inch. If
only...!!<P>

Another favored day trip was to Phoenicia, in New York’s Catskills. As Erling
Omland noted in his splendid article in the Winter Issue, we skied the Spit Cat Trail
and the Simpson Memorial Slope. The opening of state-owned Belleayre, just a few
miles further along, did the old girl in. The backside of Belleayre sited a small
friendly area called Highmount which, for obvious reasons, was seldom crowded.<P>

As roads improved, and the Great Depression slowly wound down so that better
cars became more affordable for us, we four roamed further afield. Vermont, and
eventually, New Hampshire suffered our somewhat pitiful stem christies and hockey
stops. Improvement was slow but we presevered. Vermont’s Snow Valley sticks in
memory because Fred Iselin and Elli Stiller, who later married, instructed there for
awhile and I can almost taste, even now, the raised doughnuts sold at Snow Man’s
Rest. Down the road was a more renowned area: Bromley, or Big Bromley as it was
then known. Fred Pabst installed his tows, first rope then J and T-bars, in patterns
to reduce liftlines. Bromley was upscale. Its base building was red and had a railed
balcony on the second story lined with flags of all nations. Bromley was big;
Bromley was fun. We stayed sometimes at Worthy Inn, in Manchester, where some
memorable parties unfolded. Nearer the mountains were Johnny Seesaw’s Ski Inn
and Al Zoerch’s Kandahar, both great skier lodgings.<P>

Our little group managed to get to Pico Peak several times over weekends, always
stopping at the Lindholm Diner in Rutland before making the righthand turn on to
Route 4 uphill to Pico and the Sunset Schuss. Brad and Janet Mead, Andy’s parents,
built the place and installed the first T-bar, or "he and she sticks," in the USA in
1940. Karl Acker ran the ski school and was assisted, for awhile, by Dorothy Hoyt
Nebel, a National Team member. Further east on Route 4 was Suicide Six and
Bunny Bertram whose rope tow was an arm buster. Many of the fabled Dartmouth
team skied there: Durrance, the Chivers brothers, the Bradley boys, Sel Hannah,
Ted Hunter. By the late thirties and early forties, our skiing had become reasonably
passable. Thinking back on it now, we skied on long wood boards with beartrap
bindings at first and then longthongs, on ungroomed trails, and although we suffered
our share of ignominious falls, none of our four was ever seriously hurt. Bruises yes,
and minor sprains but no broken bones.<P>

Several trips rate top billing. A glorious four day excursion to Adirondack Loj and
two lessons by Otto Schniebs. A week long trip to Quebec’s Mont Tremblant, newly
opened by Joe and Mary Ryan, with a side trip on the way home at Shawbridge and
St. Sauveur to ski fabled Hills 69 and 70, home of the Red Birds. In 1939, the winter
prior to the installation of the first single chair, John and I drove to Mt. Mansfield
and enjoyed a week’s stay at Ranch Camp managed by Trim Conkling. We skied the
old Bruce Trail, the Nose Dive with its fearsome seven turns, Steeple and other trails
which no longer exist. Mansfield and Stowe have seen us countless times since. I did
not know Charlie Lord or Ab Coleman back then, but spent many hours with
Charlie in later years.<P>

We New Yorkers even, in time, managed the far trip to New Hampshire’s Cannon
Mountain, staying at Charlie Lovett’s place and skiing the trails off the old tram,
including the late lamented Taft. At Cranmore, we rode the Skimobile and watched
Hannes Schneider from a discreet distance, talking to his instructors. And, of course,
for many springs we repaired to  Tuckerman, drawn like lemmings. Joe Dodge and
Swampy Paris linger in memory. Sidestepping as far as vertical courage permitted
and saying a small quiet prayer before assaying that first tentative turn. Perching on
Lunch Rocks watching the brave and the timid. Cooking on the rented stoves early
on and bedrolling in the shelter near Howard Johnson’s. Staying once at the old
Glen House just for the glory of it. Twice we side-tripped to Jackson to visit Black
Mountain behind the Whitney place where Carroll Reed had started his seminal
Hannes Schneider ski school under Benno Rybizka in the building which later
became the Wildcat Tavern. Unfortunately, we never did visit Peckett’s-on-Sugar
Hill during those years. However I was fortunate enough to meet Kate Peckett many
years later for a long historically revealing chat. Winston Pote, now gone, took many
spectacular photographs of the White Mountains. I had the good fortune, years later,
to also visit with him where he gave me several of his heretofore unpublished
photos.<P>

We four musketeers skied all over New England before (and after) WWII. We
mostly drove but also, on occasion, rode those old clunky snow trains out of Grand
Central Station. We went to those thirties’ ski shows in Madison Square Garden. We
were, in two words, ski nuts. We roamed all over New England and thereabouts.
Not many ski slopes, some now defunct, escaped our tracks and sitzmarks. Skiers
were not, by today’s standards, numerous. The regulars knew each other and we all
rubbed shoulders with many whose names would later loom large in skiing’s history
books. Pearl Harbor ended that phase. The four of us donned uniforms for the
duration and, thankfully, survived some interesting experiences. Post WWII, we
took up where we had left off, but now, marrying and starting families, had need to
pick and choose more carefully. Our fortunes improved and we skied the west. By
the fifties we were putting on the years. Not only we but skiing itself was changing.
Frank, first, passed on followed by the seemingly indestructible braw Scot. John and
I, with spouses, skied the Alps quite extensively in the sixties and early seventies.
Needless to say, Wengen headed my list. Scotty’s stories had made a lasting
impression. I even met Sir Arnold Lunn. However, this account is about early New
England skiing. The west and Europe are other chapters for another time.<P>

Our original four is now down to two. John, retired, lives in southern California
where he occasionally skies Mammouth while I, also retired, live in the Northeast
Kingdom of  Vermont and ski, also only occasionally on sunny weekdays, Stowe and
Mad River Glen where my own Ramapo Mountain Ski Club has a lodge just down
the road from Roland Palmedo’s Amateur Ski Club of New York and some of the ski
clubs mentioned by Erling.<P>

It’s been sixty-five years since we first rode the subway to Van Courtlandt Park. As
they say in show biz, it was a great run. And it all started with Scotty.<P>
