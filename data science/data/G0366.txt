<span class="textbd">In the second of her series of interviews with people involved in the wide field of astronomy, AT's Lydia Lousteaux interviews Richard Nugent, an enthusiastic Asteroid Hunter and Eclipse Chaser.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="text">
<p>
An 'asteroid occultation' occurs when an asteroid, moving in its orbit 
around the Sun, happens to be in alignment with the Earth and a star. Thus 
the asteroid 'eclipses' the star. The event only occurs along a narrow path 
on the ground. Timing the duration of these occultations helps astronomers 
determine the size and shape of the asteroid to unprecedented accuracy.
Several hundred asteroid shape profiles have been determined by this method, 
some of the more widely observed asteroid profiles appear each year in the 
February issue of Sky and Telescope magazine.
</p>
<p>
Observers should note that the actual path on the ground of these occultations 
is highly uncertain due to the difficulty in updating the orbit of the asteroid 
just prior to the event. For important events, astrometric updates are used 
to refine the asteroid's path. Updates and finder charts for the target 
star to these paths can be found on the IOTA Asteroid Page at:<br>
<a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/IOTA/asteroids/astrrndx.htm" class="nav2">www.lunar-occultations.com/IOTA/asteroids/astrrndx.htm</a><br>
Updates to the path, if made, are usually available on the web site within 
one week prior to the events.
</p>
<p>
The above paragraph was taken from the - April 2001 issue of 'STARSCAN', the 
newsletter for the Johnson Space Center Astronomical Society.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Mr. Nugent has articles published in the STARSCAN (Johnson 
Space Center Astronomical Society,  <a href="http://www.ghg.net/cbr/jscas" class="nav2">www.ghg.net/cbr/jscas</a>) and 
GUIDESTAR 
(Houston Astronomical Society, <a href="http://www.astronomyhouston.org" class="nav2">www.astronomyhouston.org</a>), and indeed they 
are 'stellar'. His articles on the Crab Nebula, and on Precession are very 
informative and educational. (Richard chairs the Education committee for 
H.A.S) 
</p>
<p>
Other articles Richard has written include:
"Photographic Determination of the Eccentricity of Earth's Orbit", Journal 
of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, (JRASC), 89,217, 1995.
</p>
<p>
 "Determining Locations of Unknown Sites for Astronomical Purposes", co-authored 
with Paul Maley, J. Lynn Palmer, Patricia Rosenzweig-Levy,
Orlando Naranjo, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, (PASP), 
109,719,1997
</p>
<p>
"New Measurements of the Expansion of the Crab Nebula", PASP, 110, 831, 
1998.
</p>
<p>
"An Automated Registration System", 2nd annual conference on Computer Developments, 
Univ. of Houston, 1980, with N. Chu.
</p>
<p>
(Richard would graciously send you 
copies of any of the above articles. You may write him at jackiesdad atweblore.com) 
Richard was born in New York on November 14, 1955. He has been working with 
IOTA (International Occultation Timing Association) officially for 10 years. 
</p>
<p>
Unofficially he has been "chasing asteroids" since the 1970's. Richard graduated 
from the University of Florida in 1979 and 
wrote his Master Thesis on "An 
Astrometric Study of NGC 752". Richard studied under Professor Heinrich 
Eichhorn:<br><br>
<span class="textbd">RN:</span><br>  
"Professor Eichhorn was Chairman of the astronomy department for the University of Florida, 
my thesis supervisor and mentor. He was the top person in his field in the 
world for positional astronomy and star catalogues and a consultant for 
the government agencies and military, 
back in the 1950's and 1960's when 
accurate star positions were needed for satellite observations."
</p>
<p>
"When I was working on my thesis, I was having some difficulty on data 
reductions. After correcting the problem he pointed his finger at me 
as if I were a child and said, "Richard, it is perfectly OK to make mistakes, 
BUT NOT TO PUBLISH THEM!!"
</p>
<p>
"I admired him from the day we met. He hated certain academic programs 
(considered them a waste of money) and was never afraid to speak his mind. 
When Dr. Eichhorn passed away in May 1999 of cancer, testimonials came in 
from all over the world  about his greatness and notability."
</p>
<img src="../images/telescope-rn.jpg" alt="Telescope Set-Up" width="450" height="300"><br>
<span class="textbd">Richard's telescope set-up, impressive eh?</span>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
I asked Richard what he considers to be some of his greatest achievements 
in astronomy. 
<br><span class="textbd">RN:</span><br>  
"I would rate the journeys to various umbral limit 
sites (northern and southern eclipse limits) to observe and record the Baily's 
Beads effect for IOTA."
(He mentions Dr. David Dunham-President of IOTA, 
Paul Maley and Wayne Warren as his partners in these most exciting expeditions 
for IOTA.)
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Richard's Varied Ventures in solar eclipse chasing has allowed him to 
criss-cross the earth several times, by boat, by air, and on foot. The only 
continent he hasn't yet visited is Antarctica! At the time of 
this interview, Richard was packing for Africa to further his compilation 
of scientific data on Baily's Beads and you will next find him in Costa Rica 
in December.
<br>
Richard continues his "Romantic Tales of Travel and Scientific Studies 
Of the Stars" with:<br>
"I spent two weeks at Mt. Evans in Colorado at the highest operating optical 
observatory on Earth (Meyer-Womble Observatory, with twin 28.5 inch reflectors) 
at 14,150 feet. I was attempting to get CCD images of some ancient reported 
nova in the hopes of seeing gaseous remnants. Unfortunately equipment and 
weather problems foiled my efforts."
</p>
<p>
Richard explains the importance of observing the Sun through its eclipsed 
stages: "The northern and southern eclipse limit observations are combined 
to derive the diameter of the Sun. The Sun's diameter does not appear to 
be constant as once thought, so the eclipse observations are important to 
determine if the Sun's changing size is part of the solar cycle or another 
sub cycle. Calculations complied from these events have made it possible 
to determine the Sun's diameter to several hundredths of an arc second."  
He follows up this data with: "Twenty years of data has shown us that the 
Sun may be shrinking."

<span class="textbd">3:01pm 21/06/01 Chinyingi, Zambia - R Nugent<br> Elite 200, Meade 2045D 1 sec.</span>
<p>
In addition to what he has done on the subject of solar eclipses, Richard 
mentions his many asteroid occultation expeditions for IOTA, some successful.
"The results of these successful occultations determine the size and shape 
of the particular asteroids being observed, a technique used long before 
any space probe began photographing them on its long voyage to Jupiter and 
Saturn. In January, 2000, we flew to Oklahoma to observe two asteroid occultation 
events in one night. The first, 308 Polyxo, was successful and I observed 
a 22.4 second occultation. The second event of 283 Emma a few hours later 
and 2 miles further north was foiled during the critical 30-second window 
of the event when a police car drove up and his headlights ruined the observation. 
Two succesful occultations in one night would have been a record."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
I asked Richard his opinion on the differences between amateur vs.professional 
astronomers and their separate contributions to science and the public:
<br><span class="textbd">RN:</span><br> 
"Both push their equipment to the limit, collect data and carry out extensive 
observations. The pro's contributions are largely the result of their advanced 
equipment, and are published on the Internet and
professional journals. Amateurs spread the word about astronomy at the local 
(public) level keeping interests alive and well. Take JSCAS, it is a very active group of people. Unlike the 80/20 rule in clubs where 20% of the people do 80% of the work, just about 100% of JSCAS members do 100% of the work, and are active. JSCAS has no arm chair members that I know of.
The difference in their 
contributions is mainly the capability of their equipment - if the amateurs 
had the big telescopes and sensitive detectors, they would be cranking out 
the same type of results (on a learning curve of course). As you know amateurs 
are catching up with the pros in certain fields, and surpassing them in 
others - (such as) - asteroid discoveries, novae, supernovae, variable stars, 
occultation events, fireballs, meteors, planetary observations, satellite 
passes, and other unique events. In these and other fields, amateurs and 
pros work together."
Here, Richard threw in: "You know, there is a restaurant on the Moon!" 
He caught the interviewer totally off guard with that statement, and took 
advantage of the sudden seconds of silence by quickly adding: "The food's 
great but people don't go there much because there is NO ATMOSPHERE!" 
Richard mentions his short-term goals as an amateur astronomer:
"... to undoubtedly continue with the eclipse and asteroid occultations 
and observations and to complete the construction of my own personal observatory 
in West Texas." (Richard owns property near Fort Davis, home of the annual, 
well-known Texas Star Party at Prude Ranch <a href="http://www.metronet.com/~tsp" class="nav2" class="nav2">www.metronet.com/~tsp</a>)
 "I am also interested in using new high precision star catalogue positional 
data in re-examining distances to certain star clusters and other objects 
of interest." 
 He is also working on "The Nature of The Double Star Winnecke 
4" (M40).
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span>
 I asked Richard about his personal achievements:<br>
<span class="textbd">RN:</span><br>
 "My most recent is surviving a SEAL physical training program (for civilians). 
I lost a bunch of weight and have accomplished some physical goals I never 
ever thought my body was capable of.  I have now been in the program three 
years." 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
 Richard has a daughter: Jackie, of whom he is quite proud. She 
graduated from high school in Florida in May 2001 and will attend college 
on a softball scholarship. He laughs when he mentions her passion for softball.
<br><span class="textbd">RN:</span><br>
"I think she sleeps in her softball uniform! Unfortunately she wants nothing 
to do with astronomy at this time. Maybe she will change her mind later 
on."
