<p><br><img SRC="cadeusus.jpg" height=288 width=144 align=LEFT><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DNA
underlies every aspect of human health, both in function and dysfunction.
Obtaining a detailed picture of how genes and other DNA sequences function
together and interact with environmental factors ultimately will lead to
the discovery of pathways involved in normal processes and in disease pathogenesis.
Such knowledge will have a profound impact on the way disorders are diagnosed,
treated, and prevented and will bring about revolutionary changes in clinical
and public health practice. Some of these transformative developments are
described below.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040"><font size=+1>Gene
Tests</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DNA-based tests are among the first commercial
medical applications of the new genetic discoveries. Gene tests can be
used to diagnose disease, confirm a diagnosis, provide prognostic information
about the course of disease, confirm the existence of a disease in asymptomatic
individuals, and, with varying degrees of accuracy, predict the risk of
future disease in healthy individuals or their progeny.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Currently, several hundred genetic tests
are in clinical use, with many more under development, and their numbers
and varieties are expected to increase rapidly over the next decade. Most
current tests detect mutations associated with rare genetic disorders that
follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. These include myotonic and Duchenne
muscular dystrophies, cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, sickle
cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recently, tests have been developed to 
          detect mutations for a handful of more complex conditions such as breast, 
          ovarian, and colon cancers. Although they have limitations, these tests 
          sometimes are used to make risk estimates in presymptomatic individuals 
          with a family history of the disorder. One potential benefit to using 
          these gene tests is that they could provide information that helps physicians 
          and patients manage the disease or condition more effectively. Regular 
          colonoscopies for those having mutations associated with colon cancer, 
          for instance, could prevent thousands of deaths each year.<br>
          </font><br>
          <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some scientific limitations are that the 
          tests may not detect every mutation associated with a particular condition 
          (many are as yet undiscovered), and the ones they do detect may present 
          different risks to different people and populations. Another important 
          consideration in gene testing is the lack of effective treatments or 
          preventive measures for many diseases and conditions now being diagnosed 
          or predicted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Revealing information about risk of future
disease can have significant emotional and psychological effects as well.
Moreover, the absence of privacy and legal protections can lead to discrimination
in employment or insurance or other misuse of personal genetic information.
Additionally, because genetic tests reveal information about individuals
and their families, test results can affect family dynamics. Results also
can pose risks for population groups if they lead to group stigmatization.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other issues related to gene tests include
their effective introduction into clinical practice, the regulation of
laboratory quality assurance, the availability of testing for rare diseases,
and the education of healthcare providers and patients about correct interpretation
and attendant risks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040"><font size=+1>Pharmacogenomics:
Moving Away from “One-Size-Fits-All” Therapeutics</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within the next decade, researchers will
begin to correlate DNA variants with individual responses to medical treatments,
identify particular subgroups of patients, and develop drugs customized
for those populations. The discipline that blends pharmacology with genomic
capabilities is called pharmacogenomics.</font><img SRC="dnabottle.jpg" height=221 width=136 align=RIGHT><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">More than 100,000 people die each year from adverse 
          responses to medications that are beneficial to others. Another 2.2 
          million experience serious reactions, while others fail to respond at 
          all. DNA variants in genes involved in drug metabolism, particularly 
          the cytochrome P450 multigene family, are the focus of much current 
          research in this area. Enzymes encoded by these genes are responsible 
          for metabolizing most drugs used today, including many for treating 
          psychiatric, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases. Enzyme function 
          affects patients’ responses to both the drug and the dose. Future advances 
          will enable rapid testing to determine the patient’s genotype and drastically 
          reduce hospitalization resulting from adverse reactions.</font> <br>
          <br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Genomic data and technologies also are
expected to make drug development faster, cheaper, and more effective.
Most drugs today are based on about 500 molecular targets; genomic knowledge
of the genes involved in diseases, disease pathways, and drug-response
sites will lead to the discovery of thousands of new targets. New drugs,
aimed at specific sites in the body and at particular biochemical events
leading to disease, probably will cause fewer side effects than many current
medicines. Ideally, the new genomic drugs could be given earlier in the
disease process. As knowledge becomes available to select patients most
likely to benefit from a potential drug, pharmacogenomics will speed the
design of clinical trials to bring the drugs to market sooner.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Gene Therapy,
Enhancement</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The potential for using genes themselves
to treat disease or enhance particular traits has captured the imagination
of the public and the biomedical community. This largely experimental field--gene
transfer or gene therapy--holds potential for treating or even curing such
genetic and acquired diseases as cancers and AIDS by using normal genes
to supplement or replace defective genes or bolster a normal function such
as immunity.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">More than 500 clinical gene-therapy trials
involving about 3500 patients have been identified worldwide (June 2001).
The vast majority (78%) take place in the United States, followed by Europe
(18%). Although most trials focus on various types of cancer, studies also
involve other multigenic and monogenic, infectious, and vascular diseases.
Protocols generally are aimed at establishing the safety of gene-delivery
procedures rather than effectiveness, and no cures as yet can be attributed
to these trials.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gene transfer still faces many scientific
obstacles before it can become a practical approach for treating disease.
According to the American Society of Human Genetics’ Statement on Gene
Therapy, effective progress will be achieved only through continued rigorous
research on the most fundamental mechanisms underlying gene delivery and
gene expression in animals.</font>
