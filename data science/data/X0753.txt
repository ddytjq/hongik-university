confirm any facts that are important to your decision. IMBA is not responsible
for, and cannot guarantee the performance of, goods and services provided by our

<H2>Calendars, Chat Rooms And Forums</H2>

<P>
IMBA.com wants to encourage an open exchange of information and ideas. But we
cannot and do not review every posting made in the chat rooms, forums, and other
public posting areas. You may well read any given posting before anyone on the
IMBA.com staff does. Take what you find with a grain of salt. You can expect
these areas to include information and opinions from a variety of individuals and
organizations other than IMBA.com. We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of
any posting, regardless of whether the posting comes from a user, from a
celebrity or "expert" guest, or from a member of our staff. There is no
substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment.
</P>

<P>
Responsibility for what is posted in the chat rooms, forums, and other public
posting areas on IMBA.com lies with each user -- you alone are responsible for
material you post. By using IMBA.com you agree not to post or transmit any
defamatory, abusive, obscene, threatening or illegal material, or any other
material that infringes on the ability of others to enjoy IMBA.com or that
infringes on the rights of others. We retain the right to deny access to anyone
who we believe has violated these terms or any other term of this agreement.
</P>

<P>
Although IMBA.com cannot monitor all the postings in the chat rooms, forums, and
other public areas, we reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to delete,
move, or edit any postings that come to our attention that we consider
unacceptable or inappropriate, whether for legal or other reasons. We will not,
in the ordinary course of business, review private electronic messages that are
not addressed to IMBA.com. However, we will comply with the requirements of the
law regarding disclosure of such messages to others, including law enforcement
agencies.
</P>

<P>
IMBA.com expects that you will not use the service to violate anyone's copyright,
trademark, or other intellectual property rights. By submitting material to
IMBA.com, you are representing that you are the owner of the material, or are
making your submission with the express consent of the owner. Submitting material
that is the property of another, without the consent of its owner, is not only a
violation of this agreement, but may also subject you to legal liability for
infringement of copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights.
</P>

<P>
No soliciting. You agree not to use IMBA.com to advertise or to solicit anyone to
buy or sell products or services, or to make donations of any kind, without our
express written approval.
</P>

<P>
No spamming. From time to time, users post their email addresses in our
chatrooms, forums, and other public posting areas. You agree not to gather these
email addresses for purposes of spamming.
</P>

<P>
All material you submit to any of our chat rooms, forums, and other public
posting areas becomes the property of IMBA and may be
reproduced, modified, and distributed as we see fit in any medium and for any
purpose.

YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THIS SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. BECAUSE OF THE
NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, AND THE

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<P>
The staff of IMBA.com does its best to ensure that information we post to this
site is both timely and accurate. But the news changes over time and reports that
were accurate when posted quickly become, well, old news. Though we may post
follow-up reports, and may continue to provide access to the original report, as
in an archive of news stories, for example, we don't go back and change the
original report to reflect new developments. If you're looking for the most
recent information on a given subject, and not the history of how the story
unfolded, be sure you're not looking at an out of date report.
</P>

<P>
To obtain access to certain services on our site, you may be given an opportunity
to register with IMBA.com. As part of any such registration process, you will
select a user name and a password. You agree that the information you supply
during that registration process will be accurate and complete and that you will
not register under the name of, nor attempt to enter the service under the name
of, another person. IMBA.com reserves the right to reject or terminate any user
name that, in its judgment, it deems offensive. You will be responsible for
preserving the confidentiality of your password and will notify IMBA.com's
webmaster at <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@imba.com">webmaster@imba.com</A> of any known or suspected unauthorized use of
your account.
</P>

<P>
If you would like to send IMBA an email comment or suggestion about station
operations or programming, please address it to <A
HREF="mailto:info@imba.com">info@imba.com</A>. Posting a message to a chat room,
bulletin board, or other general user forum is not a good way to communicate
directly with the IMBA.

hope you enjoy using IMBA.com, and we welcome suggestions for improvements.
