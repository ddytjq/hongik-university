The pathway:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Vision is generated by photoreceptors in the <B>retina</B>,a layer of cells at the back of the eye.  The information leavesthe eye by way of the <B>optic nerve</B>, and there is a partialcrossing of axons at the <B>optic chiasm</B>.  After the chiasm,the axons are called the <B>optic tract</B>.  The optic tractwraps around the midbrain to get to the <B>lateral geniculatenucleus</B> (LGN), where all the axons must synapse.  From there,the LGN axons fan out through the deep white matter of the brainas the <B>optic radiations</B>, which will ultimately travel to<B>primary visual cortex</B>, at the back of the brain.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  Visual fields:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Information about the world enters both eyes witha great deal of overlap.  Try closing one eye, and you will findthat your range of vision in the remaining eye is mainly limitedby your nose.  The image projected onto your retina can be cutdown the middle, with the <B>fovea</B> defining the center.  Nowyou have essentially two halves of the retina, a left half anda right half.  Generally, the halves are referred to as a <B>temporalhalf</B> (next to your temple) and a <B>nasal half </B>(next toyour nose).  </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Visual images are inverted as they pass through thelens.  Therefore, in your right eye, the nasal retina sees theright half of the world, while the temporal retina sees the lefthalf of the world.  Notice also that the right nasal retina andthe left temporal retina see pretty much the same thing.  If youdrew a line through the world at your nose, they would see everythingto the right of that line.  That field of view is called the <B>righthemifield</B>.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">So, what you see is divided into right and left hemifields. Each eye gets information from both hemifields.  For every objectthat you can see, both eyes are actually seeing it - this is crucialfor depth perception - but the image will be falling on one nasalretina and one temporal retina. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Why bother to divide the retinas at all?  Recallthat the brain works on a crossed wires system.  The left halfof the brain controls the right side of the body, and vice versa. Therefore the left half of the brain is only interested in visualinput from the right side of the world.  To insure that the braindoesn't get extraneous information, the fibers from the retinasort themselves out to separate right hemifield from left hemifield. Specifically, <U>fibers from the nasal retinas cross over atthe optic chiasm</U> - whereas the temporal retinas, already positionedto see the opposite side of the world, do not cross.  Here iswhat it looks like:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis2.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The practical consequences of this crossing are thatdamaging the visual system before the chiasm will affect <B>oneeye, both hemifields</B> - analogous to closing one eye.  Damagingthe pathway after the chiasm, though, will damage parts of <B>botheyes, and only one hemifield</B>.  There is no easy way to imaginewhat this would look like.  Your field of view would be only 90&#176;,from straight ahead to one side.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  Lesions</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The easiest way to demonstrate to yourself the consequencesof lesions is to strike through a pathway, follow the fibers backto the retina, and see what was affected.  Notice that there arelines and numbers drawn on the visual field diagram.  For each&quot;cut&quot;, determine what parts of the patient's visualfield will be affected.  The way to record a loss of visual fieldis with two circles, called "perimetry charts" as below. You can think of these circles as a pair of goggles that thepatient is looking through, and you blacken those parts of thegoggles where vision is lost.  This is done separately for eacheye, and drawn from the patient's perspective - the right circlerepresents the right eye.  For example:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis3.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Now, try to draw visual field diagrams for lesions1-3 in the diagram above.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Scroll down for the answers.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+</FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=257><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Lesion 1:  This is analogous to losing an eye.

To figure these out,you need to know about <B>Meyer's loop</B> and the optic radiations. The optic radiations follow a very wide three dimensional arc. Here is how the radiations are conventionally drawn, and howthey look from the side:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis7.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">You can see that the longer loop actually dives intothe temporal lobe before it heads back to the occipital lobe. This group of fibers is called Meyer's loop.  Recall that, sincethe lens inverts all images, the lower half of the retina seesthe upper half of the world.  This orientation is preserved throughthe pathway, so that the lower optic radiations, or Meyer's loop,are carrying information from the upper visual world.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Now try to work through lesions 4-6.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+<BR>+</FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=257><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Lesion 4:  Meyer's loop has been cut, so vision will be lost in the upper visual world, but only in the left hemifield.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=257><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis8.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=257><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Lesion 5:  Here the parietal portion of the optic radiations were cut, so you would affect the lower visual world on one side.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=257><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis9.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=257><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Lesion 6:  At first this seems to be a straightforward loss of one hemifield.

Anatomy</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">You should be able to follow the visual pathway throughcoronal or horizontal sections.  In a coronal series, the mostrostral thing you will see is the optic chiasm.  The optic tractswill diverge and sneak up laterally around the cerebral pedunclesbefore diving into the LGN.  Don't confuse the optic chiasm withthe anterior commissure;  the chiasm will always hang down fromthe base of the brain, while the commissure will be embedded intissue. <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis11.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In horizontal sections you can see the optic radiationsclearly, and you can identify the general vicinity of visual cortex. First find the <B>calcarine sulcus </B>on the medial surfaceof the occipital lobe.  Primary visual cortex, or <B>V1</B>, isburied within this sulcus.  In a fortuitous section, you may beable to see a fine white stripe running within the grey matterinside the sulcus.  This stripe marks V1, and gives it a thirdname, <B>striate cortex</B>.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvis12.gif"><BR><BR><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
