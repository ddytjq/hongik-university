Window Handles vs. TRichEdit (and Other VCL) Controls</H2>
<P>When enhancing the TRichEdit class, I ran into a couple
  of problems worth noting.&nbsp; The first is reasonably
  obvious and the second is likely to be a mystery until
  reading the VCL source code. 
</P> 
<H4>Problem #1</H4>
<P>The first problem that I ran into was attempting to send
  messages to a TRichEdit before the underlying Windows
  handle was created.&nbsp; For example, if you try to do the
  following in the form's constructor, it will not work. 
</P> <PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">::SendMessage(RichEdit1-&gt;Handle, EM_EXLIMITTEXT, 0, (LPARAM) 0x7fffffff);</PRE>

<P> The problem is two-fold:&nbsp; (1) RichEdit1-&gt;Handle
  is not valid at the time the form's constructor is called
  and (2) The EM_EXLIMITTEXT message does not return a value
  indicating success or failure.&nbsp; Worse yet, the error
  can be silent (no abend) if the handle parameter is a valid
  window handle (zero, for example, is a valid handle).&nbsp;
  I do not know for sure, but Windows may simply discard
  invalid messages with invalid handle parameters, so you may
  never get an error. 
</P> 
<P>I cannot blame anyone for myself for stumbling on this
  one, though.&nbsp; The next one was much less obvious, at
  least to me. 
</P> 
<H4>Problem #2</H4>
<P>The second problem was that the VCL destroys and
  re-creates the TRichEdit control's underlying Windows
  handle unexpectedly.&nbsp; For example, and I am working
  from memory here, changing the control's HideScrollBars and
  ScrollBars properties causes the VCL to destroy the window
  and re-create it.&nbsp; This is done because these
  attributes are set when the window is created -- the
  Windows API does not supply a way to change them on the
  fly. 
</P> 
<P>The VCL jumps through some hoops to try to make this
  transparent.&nbsp; For example, the current contents of the
  control are saved in a memory stream and reloaded after the
  window is re-created. 
</P> 
<P>The problem with all of this is that some information
  about the TRichEdit's current state may get lost in the
  shuffle.&nbsp; For example, the TRichEditOleCallback code
  available on this site sends a message to the TRichEdit's
  true Windows handle to set the Rich Edit OLE callback to
  point to the TRichEditOleCallback class's OLE
  handler.&nbsp; The VCL knows nothing about all of this and,
  thus, does not save and restore the setting.&nbsp; The net
  result is that, when the Windows handle is destroyed and
  re-created, the OLE callback functionality is lost. 
</P> 
<P>This Windows handle destruction and re-creation dance
  happens elsewhere in the VCL in a function called
  RecreateWnd().&nbsp; This may affect your TRichEdit
  unexpectedly.&nbsp; For example, I had placed my TRichEdit
  on a TTabSheet on a TPageControl.&nbsp; I then added a user
  option to change the TPageControl's MultiLine
  property.&nbsp; Guess what&#133; when the user changes the
  MultiLine property, the VCL does a RecreateWnd() on the
  TPageControl which cascades down to all of its child
  controls.&nbsp; My TRichEdit just got trashed and
  re-created. 
</P> 
<P>I do not blame Borland for taking this approach.&nbsp;
  In fact, I do not think there is a significantly better way
  given the limitations in the Windows API.&nbsp; And I even
  suppose that we should expect side-effects when changing
  property values since that is pretty much what properties
  are for.&nbsp; However, I do wish that Borland would
  document these side-effects in the help files. 
</P> 
<P>The good news is that you can override RecreateWnd() in
  your own TRichEdit-derived class to add the needed
  functionality.
