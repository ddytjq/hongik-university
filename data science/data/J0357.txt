<h1>Indianapolis Raceway Park</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Indianapolis Raceway Park is that rarity, an active race track which remains on
good terms with its close residential neighbors and has done so for over 30
years of operation.
IRP is owned by the NHRA, and contains a dragstrip, a 5/8 mile paved oval, and
the road course.
Spectator and televised events are run each year at all three tracks in the
facility.
Perhaps the most famous IRP event is the evening of USAC
oval track racing offered the night before the Indianapolis 500
(which is held at an obscure facility in nearby Speedway, Indiana.)

<h2><a name="GettingThere">Getting to Indianapolis Raceway Park</a></h2>
The track is about 25 miles west of downtown Indianapolis, just west of
Clermont, with the competitor entrance (Gate 8) on Hunter Road (County Road
1000E) about a mile south of US-136, along the western edge of the track
property.
The railroad crossing on Hunter Road has recently been provided with
lights and a gate.
<p>
Registration may be in a tent along the access road inside the track, or may
be in the medical building to the southeast.

<h2><a name="RacersGuide">A Racers' Guide to Indianapolis Raceway Park</a></h2>
<h3>The Paddock</h3>
IRP's competitor facilities are quite good.
There are two main paddock areas; both are west of the front straight and north
of the dragstrip grandstand.
The South paddock is inside an interior fenced-in area and has paved or
gravelled access roads; the North paddock is all grass with limited access
roads, north of the medical building and Tech area.
It is not necessary to cross the track to enter or leave either of the
paddocks.
Tech is held on the south side of the large building at the northwest corner of
the interior fenced-in area (it's significantly uphill if you're pushing the car
by hand).
The pits are located at the south end of the main straight along the dragstrip,
in front of the grandstand, and are a relatively long walk from either paddock
area.
<p>
The food concession building at the east side of the South paddock contains
flush toilets, wash basins, and showers.
The floor of this part of the building is below grade, however, and
tends to collect water and mud.
The cafeteria in this building serves food which is usually good, and usually
one or more hot sandwich carts are set up on the grounds.
There are no permanent fueling provisions, but racing gas has always been
available at the track for SCCA Nationals and Regionals, usually from a truck
located on the paved area south of the concession building; air is available
from the tire concessions, usually located on the paved area east of the food
concession building.
<h3>The Track</h3>
The IRP road course is a high-speed 2.5-mile 15-turn course, wide and with
little elevation change, using parts of the drag strip, shutdown area, and
staging area.
CSR cars using four gears in a five-speed gearbox reach speeds around 140 MPH
going into Turn 1, and take the slowest corner at around 70 MPH.
The track surface is quite rough in several areas from Turn 5 through Turn 11,
and runoff areas are sharply limited around Turns 5, 12, and 15.
Apexes and exits of most turns have ruts just off the track surface, but it is
generally safe to pull a low ground-clearance car off the track elsewhere.
<p>
What follows is a generic description of the track, describing its features
without defining speeds, gears, or shift points -- all of which will vary
widely from car type to car type.
<p>
Few of the turns at this track are sufficiently separated by straight segments
to be treated as isolated turns; IRP contains more sets of clustered turns
(where your line through or out of a turn must be modified to accomodate the
requirements of the next turn or the one after it) than any other track I can
recall running -- there are only five corners that can successfully be treated
in isolation.
Because of the number of clustered turns, and because some of the isolated turns
are themselves very close together, you have to work hard at IRP; there are
only two or three places on the track where you can relax a little and check
your instruments.
<p>
The false grid for all sessions is along the pit access road between the pits
and the grandstand.
You must be able to back into the proper slot in the false grid; if you do
not have a working reverse gear you will need someone along to push the car.
You will proceed south along the pit lane and make a tight U-turn onto the pit
lane for practice and qualifying, a less tight U-turn onto the track for the
race.
<p> 
The starter's stand is often not visible to the end of the pack at starts,
but the front straight is wide enough that there is seldom a problem from
unexpected wave-offs.
Get over to the left edge of the track when it is convenient to do so.
Turn 1 is a very high-speed flat 90-degree sweeping right-hand turn, followed
by a short straight and another right-hand turn.
There's a lot of passing from sheer speed differential at the end of the front
straight, but entering Turn 1 side-by-side at speed is a dangerous manouver,
especiially so if you're on the outside.
When everything is working right, you should aspire to enter Turn 1 at full
speed and without lifting, letting the friction of the turn slow you enough
that you can enter Turn 2 also without lifting -- but
<b>not all cars can do this
</b>
and you should work up to it.
There is a lot of runoff area outside Turn 1; it's reasonably flat but there's
a noticeable dropoff just at the track edge.
<p>
The sound measurements are taken between Turns 1 and 2 on the
<i>
inside
</i>
of the track.
<p>
Turn 2 is a flat high-speed 60-degree right-hand turn which should slow you
just enough that you will likely want to downshift one gear before entering
Turn 3; your normal track position at the exit of Turn 2 is correct for
entering Turn 3.
There is a tunnel under the short straight between Turns 2 and 3; if you really
blow Turn 2 big-time you might end up in it.
<p>
You now enter the first of the turn clusters, from Turn 3 through Turn 5.
Turn 3 is a fast flat 90-degree right-hand turn followed closely by Turn 4, a
fast 120-degree left-hand sweeper and a short uphill straight into Turn 5, a
slightly off-camber partly-blind fast 45-degree right-hand turn.
After leaving Turn 3, move back to the right for a proper entry into Turn 4;
you may have to leave some space at the left edge of the exit of 3 to get
back to the right soon enough for the entry to 4.
You've got to balance your Turn 4 exit speed and track position against the
requirement for a late and tight apex in Turn 5.
This is commonly done by taking a late apex in Turn 4 and heading more or less
straight toward the apex of Turn 5, with as much of a left-right S-bend as you
can manage.
Turn 5 is tricky, since the track goes from clearly uphill to slightly downhill
right about at the apex.
Turn 5 is also dangerous; a too-early apex in Turn 4 may put you into the wall
at the inside of 5, and a too-early apex in Turn 5 may put you off on the grass
at the outside of the turn, which slopes down to the trees and fence at the
edge of the track property.
<p>
There is a longish slightly downhill straight after Turn 5 which leads into
the next cluster of turns in the drag strip staging area, Turns 6 through 8.
Turn 6 is a fairly high-speed flat 135-degree right-hand turn followed
closely by Turn 7, a fast 90-degree left-hand turn, then Turn 8, a very vast
45-degree right-hand kink.
You've usually got to modify your lines through Turn 6 and 7 to set up for Turn
8, where a high exit speed is the most important part of the turn cluster.
The apex of Turn 8 has a very severe bump, you may have to adjust your line to
actual apex a couple of feet to the left to avoid unsettling or damaging your
car on this bump.
<p>
Following Turn 8 is a short straight laid out in pylons.
The pylons will be disturbed during every session, so be on the lookout for
those which come to rest on the racing line.
Following this little straight is another cluster, Turns 9 through 11.
Turn 9 is a high-speed slightly downhill 90-degree right-hand turn; you must
make a very late apex and/or stay a little toward the right side of the track at
the exit to set up properly for the closely following high-speed jog (Turns 10
and 11) to the left.
<p>
The track then goes uphill slightly and straight into Turn 12, a flat
moderate-speed 180-degree right-hand sweeper followed closely by Turns 13
and 14, a fast jog to the right leading to the braking area for Turn 15.
Turns 12 and 14 each leave the car properly positioned for the following turn.
<p>
Turn 15 is the single most important turn at IRP.
It's a narrow slightly-banked increasing-radius 180-degree left-hand turn out
onto the front straight, and must be taken exactly right to assure high speed
down that straight and into Turn 1.
There are concrete barriers closing off part of the right-hand surface at the
entry to the drag strip, so it is imperative that you do not take an early apex.
The pit lane is entered by keeping well to the left through Turn 10.
<p>
At the north end of the pit lane, you enter the track by keeping to the right;
you re-enter the paddock by keeping to the left.
Impound is reached by bearing to the left and then taking the middle roadway
north past the tower and scales and then doing a very tight U-turn.

On the west side of Clermont, at the traffic light at US-136 and County Line
Road (Raceway Road), is a United gas station with fairly good prices on street
gas and Turbo Blue racing gas (111 AON leaded) at a very favorable price.
There are fast food
chains and other shopping in Clermont [this perhaps should
refer to Speedway, not Clermont -- rpw] along US-136.
There are also grocery stores, restaurants, fast food chains, and other
shopping on the east and north sides of Brownsburg, on US-136 and Route 267
about five miles west of the track.
<p>
Accomodations can be a bit of a problem, since Indianapolis hosts a very large
number of conventions throughout the year.
Camping is not permitted on the track property, even in self-contained
motorhomes.
The Raceway Family Campground is just west and south of the track on Hunter
Road, and may be reached at (317) 852-5975 or (317) 852-5115.
<p>
There are motels at various distances from the track; this list was updated in
July 1994, using information from the AAA Tour Book, race entry forms, various
motel chain accomodation guides, the local telephone directory, and personal
observation.
Prices where shown are per night in a two-person two-bed room; an 'AAA'
indicates that discounts are available for AAA members; an 'IRP' indicates
that discounts are available for race competitors (mention their ad in the IRP
schedule flyer); a 'DR' indicates a dining room on the premises or nearby; a
'P' indicates that small pets are permitted, sometimes at an extra fee; an
'F&S' indicates that there are special weekend rates; a 'CL' indicates a
coin-operated laundry on the premises; and a 'DEP' indicates that a reservation
deposit is required.
This listing is organized approximately by increasing distance from the track.
