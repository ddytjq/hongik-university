<H1>North West Trains League</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1982</H2>
<P>As part of the establishment of the national non-league pyramid, the two
senior leagues in the North West, the
<A HREF="/england/league/nwc/cclchamp.html">Cheshire County League</A> (founded
1919) and the <A HREF="/england/league/lcombchamp.html">Lancashire Combination</A>
(founded 1891) agreed to merge to form a single feeder league to the Northern
Premier League. Allocation of clubs to the three divisions of the new league was
by ground facilities and performances over the previous two seasons. Promotion
to the NPL was not automatic initially, the NPL feeder league champions had to
apply for election. This remained the situation until 1987 when the NPL,
contrary to the wishes of its feeder leagues, formed a new division. This
stripped the North West Counties league of many of its strongest clubs and it
was forced to re-organise itself into its present two division structure.
However automatic promotion to the NPL for the NWC champions was at last
granted, subject to the usual  ground criteria. Most NWC champions have been
accepted for promotion since then.</P>
