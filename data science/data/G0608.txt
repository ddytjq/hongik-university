DMR Images</h1>

<hr>The images below were created from the COBE <a href="dmr_products.html">DMR
data products</a>. Each image has been histogram equalized, giving a non-linear
relation between color value and temperature. Use the data products for
quantitative analysis. Additional images are available in the <a href="slide_captions.html">COBE
Slide Set</a>.
<p>Before the full (four-year) DMR data set was calibrated and made into
sky maps, preliminary maps based on 1-year and 2-year subsets of the data
were created. While they have been superseded by the 4-year maps, these
early renditions received much publicity. Thus we feature on this page
both <a href="#2yr">2-year</a> and <a href="#4yr">4-year</a> DMR maps.
<p>There is an <i>important qualitative difference between the 2-year and
4-year maps</i> having to do with the improved signal-to-noise ratio that
results when more data are analyzed at once. The 4-year maps, which include
twice as much data as the 2-year maps, have a signal-to-noise ratio roughly
the square root of 2 (<i>i.e.,</i> 1.4) times better than the 2-year maps.
This modest improvement in map quality is sufficient to reveal individual
features of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in good contrast to the
instrument noise. Due to the greater effect of instrument noise in the
2-year maps, those maps can be analyzed <i>statistically</i> to characterize
the CMB fluctuations, but do not constitute accurate "pictures of the sky."
However, in <a href="#stereo">the final 4-year map</a>, individual bright
and faint spots represent actual CMB features. Illustrations of the major
data analysis steps, and further explanations of the cosmic microwave background
anisotropy (brightness fluctuations) are given below.
<h2>
<a NAME="2yr"></a>Maps Based on Two Years of DMR Observation</h2>
Cosmic microwave background temperature data were extracted from the released
FITS files and then combined into two linear combinations. The first is
a weighted sum of the 53 and 90 GHz channels which gives the highest signal-to-noise
ratio for cosmic temperature variations but includes the Milky Way Galaxy
as well. In the second linear combination, a multiple of the 31 GHz map
is subtracted from a weighted sum of the 53 plus 90 GHz channels to give
a "reduced map" that gives zero response to the observed Galaxy, zero response
to free-free emission, but full response to variations in the cosmic temperature.
<p>These maps have been smoothed with a 7 degree beam, giving an effective
angular resolution of 10 degrees. An all-sky image in Galactic coordinates
is plotted using the equal-area Mollweide projection. The plane of the
Milky Way Galaxy is horizontal across the middle of each picture. Sagittarius
is in the center of the map, Orion is to the right and Cygnus is to the
left.
<p>The following image is similar to the June 1992 Physics Today cover
picture, with the map including the dipole and Galaxy on the top, the dipole
removed map in the middle, and the reduced map on the bottom. The dipole,
a smooth variation between relatively hot and relatively cold areas from
the upper right to the lower left, is due to the motion of the solar system
relative to distant matter in the universe. The signals attributed to this
variation are very small, only one thousandth the brightness of the sky.

<p>The following image just shows the reduced map (i.e., both the dipole
and Galactic emission subtracted). The cosmic microwave background fluctuations
are extremely faint, only one part in 100,000 compared to the 2.73 degree
Kelvin average temperature of the radiation field. The cosmic microwave
background radiation is a remnant of the Big Bang and the fluctuations
are the imprint of density contrast in the early universe. The density
ripples are believed to have given rise to the structures that populate
the universe today: clusters of galaxies and vast regions devoid of galaxies.

<h2>
<a NAME="4yr"></a>Maps Based on Observations Made Over the Entire 4-year
Mission</h2>
Some of the features seen in the four-year maps below (<i>i.e.,</i> dipole,
Milky Way Galaxy) were described above. Like the two-year maps, the four-year
maps have been smoothed to an effective angular resolution of 10 degrees.
At this angular scale, the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficient (~2 per
10 degree patch) to portray for the first time an accurate visual impression
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy.
<p>The following image represents DMR data from the 53 GHz band <i>(top)</i>
on a scale from 0 - 4 K, showing the near-uniformity of the CMB brightness,
<i>(middle)</i>
on a scale intended to enhance the contrast due to the dipole described
above, and <i>(bottom)</i> following subtraction of the dipole component.

<p>The next image shows data obtained at each of the three DMR frequencies
- 31.5, 53, and 90 GHz - following dipole subtraction.

<p>The following image shows the 53 GHz map <i>(top)</i> prior to dipole
subtraction, <i>(middle)</i> after dipole subtraction, and <i>(bottom)</i>
after subtraction of a model of the Galactic emission. The Galactic emission
model is based on COBE/DIRBE far-infrared and Haslam <i>et al.</i> (1982)
408 MHz radio continuum observations (see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ...464L...1B">Bennett
<i>et
al.</i> 1996, ApJ, 464, L1</a>). Bennett <i>et al.</i> excluded an area
around the Galactic plane referred to as the 'custom cut' region when they
analyzed the CMB anisotropy. The excluded pixels are listed in two files
that can be retrieved by anonymous ftp from the <a href="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr/asds4">
spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr/asds4 directory</a> on nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov.

<p><a NAME="stereo"></a>Finally, here is the COBE-DMR "Map of the Early
Universe." This false-color image shows tiny variations in the intensity
of the cosmic microwave background measured in four years of observations
by the Differential Microwave Radiometers on NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE). The cosmic microwave background is widely believed to be a remnant
of the Big Bang; the blue and red spots correspond to regions of greater
or lesser density in the early Universe. These "fossilized" relics record
the distribution of matter and energy in the early Universe before the
matter became organized into stars and galaxies. While the initial discovery
of variations in the intensity of the CMB (made by COBE in 1992) was based
on a mathematical examination of the data, the new picture of the sky from
the full four-year mission gives an accurate visual impression of the data.
The features traced in this map stretch across the visible Universe: the
largest features seen by optical telescopes, such as the "Great Wall" of
galaxies, would fit neatly within the smallest feature in this map. (Caption
