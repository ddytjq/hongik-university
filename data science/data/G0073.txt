6-meter Bol'shoi Teleskop Azimultal'nyi (BTA), Nizhnii Arkhyz, Russia

<p>This is the famous Soviet (now Russian) 6-meter telescope, in operation
since 1976. The first really large optical telescope to incorporate an 
altazimuth mount (and thus requiring constant computer control to operate), it 
is located
on the slopes of Mount Pastukhov on the northern side of the Caucasus
range, between the Black and Caspian Seas. The telescope uses an f/4
primary mirror (giving a 26-meter tube housed in a dome 58 meters high),
with instruments located in an expansive prime-focus housing or at one of the 
Nasmyth foci on either side of the fork mount (one of the spectrographs has 
a collimator 2 meters across).

<p><a href="btatwix.jpg"><img src="btatwixs.jpg" align=left
height=277 width=197 alt="Twilight view of BTA dome"></a> I got a chance to try the BTA 
first-hand in 1990, using a multifiber array designed by
Viktor Afanasiev and coworkers to map the kinematics of interacting galaxies. 
The twilight picture of the dome shows the construction crane, left
in place since there was no pressing reason to remove it, a construction jig
used for the dome segments, and the
entrance tunnel for the front door, to maintain access even during severe
winters.
The need for field rotation means that one must simultaneously track two 
guide stars on opposite sides of the field center to keep both the field 
position and orientation constant, for which a mirror arrangement feeds opposite 
sides of the guiding TV camera. At the rate at which the Keck I telescope was 
adding mirror segments 
at this time, I just barely managed to be using the largest optical telescope 
on Earth. Maybe one of these days I'll be able to repeat
such a performance... Anyway, the fiber array generated sets of spectra, 
partially blended but separable because of slightly different wavelength 
coverage. Data reduction starts from such a frame, extracts each individual 
spectrum, and then goes on to produce maps of line intensity, velocity or 
ionization, as seen in 
sample data shown below for the starburst wind of NGC 2782. A direct image
can be taken with the lenslet array outline superimposed on the object,
to verify how the data are registered on the sky (each rectangle
shows a 2x2 set of apertures). Results from my
observing run appeared in several papers - 
one on the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1991ApJ...375L...5K&db_key=AST&high=3650739d2a00851">spin properties of spirals in pairs</a>,

<p>The experience of observing
with the BTA was described in the following article I did for 
<a href="http://www.skypub.com">Sky and Telescope</a> 
(text copyright Sky Publishing Corporation 1992, reproduced here

originally accompanying the article.</p>

Galaxies Through a Red Giant

<p> A table of the world's largest optical telescopes would
include names familiar to practicing observers and armchair
enthusiasts alike: Palomar, Kitt Peak, Cerro Tololo, and
their kin.  However, for 15 years the list has been topped
by an enigma - the 6-meter reflector of the former Soviet
Union.</p>

<p>Few results from this huge instrument have appeared in
Western literature, and rumors persist that attribute this
dearth to the facility's poor optical quality,
instrumentation, and observing conditions.  While foreigners
occasionally are given time on the 6-meter, very few U. S.
astronomers have actually used it.  In fact, there is
relatively little firsthand information in the West on its
capabilities.</p>

<p>The possibility of my using the 6-meter telescope opened up
in late 1989 during conversations in Alabama with members of
its staff, who work for the Special Astrophysical
Observatory (SAO) of the Soviet -- now Russian -- Academy of
Sciences.</p>

<p>Like many optical observers, I have traveled far and wide in
search of photons.  I have used telescopes at Kitt Peak and
Lowell observatories to investigate interacting galaxies in
particular, trying to learn how the internal motions during
such collisions trigger star formation and nuclear activity.</p>

<p>SAO astronomer Igor Karachentsev, a member of the time-
allocation committee for the 6-meter telescope, suggested
that it would be well suited for spectroscopy of such
objects.  I hurriedly sketched out an observing proposal
before he returned home.  Several months later, I was
surprised to receive a telegram informing me that my program
was allocated three nights on the telescope in December,
1990.<p>

<center><font size="+1">CYCLOPS OF THE CAUCASUS</font></center>

<p>
The 6-meter telescope is listed under various names in
English-language publications.  Some references link it to
the village of Zelenchukskaya 40 kilometers to its north,
after the nearby Zelenchuk River, or after Mount Pastukhov,
where the telescope is sited.  But officially it is the
Bolshoi Teleskop Azimutal'ny ("Large Altazimuth Telescope"),
or simply BTA.  Conceived in the mid-1960's, the BTA went
into operation in 1976.  </p>

<p>The telescope is situated at an altitude of 2,070 meters
(6,800 feet) on the northern slopes of the Caucasus
Mountains.  It lies about 150 km south of Stavropol between
the Black and Caspian seas, within Russia but very near the
boundary with Georgia.  The observatory staff and their
families live close by in the small scientific enclave of
Nizhny Arkhyz, in the valley of the Greater Zelenchuk River.
Some of the locals call the village Bukovo, after the beech
(<i>buk</i>) trees that populate the forest.  About 1,000 persons
live in its four high-rise apartment buildings.  The
location is isolated enough that the town must have its own
schools, shops, post office, and power plant.  Machine
shops, computing facilities, and photographic labs are also
here.</p>

<p>The observatory is usually reached through the resort and
spa town of Mineralniye Vody ("mineral waters"), to which
there are daily flights from Moscow and rail connections.
It takes most of a day to reach Nizhny Arkhyz by public
transit, but only three hours using the observatory van -- a
privilege accorded Western visitors.  The road winds through
both glum industrial towns and picturesque countryside.
About 20 km outside of Zelenchukskaya the road actually rims
the sprawling RATAN-600 radio telescope.  This ring antenna,
600 meters in diameter, is aimed by angling its individual
panels toward a central receiver.</p>

<p>Just as at Kitt Peak or the European Southern Observatory,
the presence of a large facility provides a useful site for
smaller telescopes run by other institutions.  Kazan
University (about 1,000 km east of Moscow) maintains an
observing station on Mount Pastukhov.  It consists of a
small astrograph for student projects, a 61-cm reflector for
occultations and photometry, and a large new horizontal
telescope for work on lunar motion and coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Practically in the shadow of the BTA is a 1-meter Zeiss Jena
reflector, which recently completed a year of shakedown
operations.  According to Vladimir Romanenko, who was
responsible for some of these tests, the telescope is used
for direct photography and a program to measure stellar
magnetic fields using polarimetry.  A coude spectrograph
should be completed sometime this year.</p>

<p><a href="btawckx.jpg"><img src="btawckxs.jpg" align=right
height=256 width=378></a>The BTA itself is an altazimuth reflector whose Ritchey-
Chretien optics have a primary focal ratio of f/4.
Instruments ride either in a large prime-focus cabin or on
one of the two Nasmyth platforms that top the azimuth fork.
The telescope's designers felt there was little need for a
Cassegrain focus, as the image scale at prime focus (8.6 arc
seconds per millimeter) is comparable to that found at the
Cassegrain or Ritchey-Chretien focuses of most 4-meter
telescopes.  Eliminating a Cassegrain focus allowed a very
clean design, and the primary's cell swings quite close to
the observing floor.  Cables to the prime-focus cage are not
apparent externally, so the telescope retains an uncluttered
appearance.  This probably contributes to the impression
that it doesn't really look as big as it is.</p>

<p>The massive altazimuth mount -- the first for a large
optical telescope -- points, tracks, and compensates for
field rotation well.  The real problems, ironically, stem
from the conservative <optical> design philosophy.  The relatively
slow f/4 optics dictated a long tube and a large dome, with
correspondingly high thermal inertia.  Not surprisingly,
therefore, the BTA's optics have had a long history of
difficulty acclimating to the ambient temperature.</p>

<p>Low- and high-dispersion spectrographs are located on the
two Nasmyth platforms, which are reached by elevators
running through the bottom of the vertical fork mounting.
For the latter spectrograph, the collimator mirror alone is
2 meters across!  The Nasmyth foci are fed by a rotatable
tertiary mirror located along the elevation axis of the
telescope mount, so that each focal point is fixed (but
rotates) with respect to the spectrographs.  The SAO staff
makes the best use of the available observing time by
rapidly switching between prime-focus and Nasmyth
instruments; thus single-object spectroscopy can be
substituted when the seeing or sky transparency is too poor
for prime-focus work on faint objects.</p>

<p>A telescope is only as good as its instruments, and the BTA
is only now getting the kinds of modern digital detectors
that can make it competitive with other large telescopes.
At the prime focus, spectroscopy can be done either with a
long slit or a mapping array of optical fibers.  These are
normally done with a photon-counting system, though recently
charge-coupled devices (CCD's) have become available.
Imaging, using either direct photography or CCD's, is also
done at the prime focus.  Since the prime focus offers a
wide field, future plans include upgrading the CCD's and
greater use of multiobject instruments.</p>

<p>Large altazimuth telescopes can function only under constant
computer control.  The ones running the BTA and its
instruments, while adequate to the task, are comparable to
those found at Kitt Peak or Lick a decade ago.  But faster,
more capable PC's handle the data reduction and analysis.
Fortunately, these are no longer under export control, and I
saw models made in a variety of countries.  But finding the
money to purchase computers, tapes, and disks is difficult.</p>

<center><font size="+1">MEETING THE RED GIANT</font></center>

<p>SAO director Viktor Afanasiev and his research group gave me
the option of observing with a long-slit spectrograph at the
prime focus or with a fiber-array spectrograph that could
map all parts of a 10-by-15-arc-second area at once.  Some
of the objects on my program clearly have complicated
dynamics, so I quickly opted for the fiber array.  But my
choice required extra preparation, since there are unique
problems in aiming blind to such a small area.</p>

<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, Afanasiev's group would be
observing on three nights adjacent to mine.  Since some of
them would have to be on the mountain to support the
instrument I would use, we agreed to share all six nights
and split any clear ones.  This was a welcome compromise,
since it spread out the risk of bad weather.  Afanasiev and
his collaborators have begun a large program to map the
emission lines from the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies, as a
probe of gas flow along small bars around the nuclei.</p>

<p><a href="btamenux.jpg"><img src="btamenuxs.jpg" align=right
height=300 width=450 alt="Reduction commands at BTA console"></a>
The actual observing experience is similar to that at most
large telescopes -- the observer watches monitors in an
enclosed control room.  There is a direct video image of the
field under study, and all manual guiding is based on this
display.  That's as close as I came to actually running the
telescope.  Given the rapidly changeable local weather,
observers often stick their heads out windows to check for
clouds.  But glimpsing the whole sky at once requires
rousing the watchman to unlock the front door - something
not done frivolously in the wee hours of the morning.</p>

<p>By the run's second night I had obtained some fiber-array
spectra, relieving my fear of returning home empty-handed.
The setup for each object can take as long as 30 minutes,
using the stars visible in small offset fields to locate
the galaxy of interest, rotating the spectrograph if a
particular orientation on the sky is needed, taking an image
of the target through the spectrograph optics to verify the
relative positions of the fiber apertures, and taking sets
of wavelength-calibration exposures.  All this provides a
strong incentive to use long exposures once everything is
set up.</p>

<p>During much of the observing run, we played tag with clouds
and wind.  Despite the telescope's immense mass (840 tons!)
pointing into a strong wind introduces unacceptable shaking.
When the strong prevailing winds blow in from the Caucasus
range to the south, observations are restricted to
declinations north of +42 degrees.  This is especially frustrating
in winter, when most galaxies lie south of the Milky Way.
At one point in our blustery run, SAO astronomer Alla
Shapovalova invoked international relations to keep the
operator from closing the dome.  "You mean you want Bill to
go back to America with no data?" she prodded.</p>

<center><font size="+1"> AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE</font></center>

<p>Aside from getting the observations themselves, I found this
visit to have special value in getting a look at a different
astronomical community. Optical astronomy is making steady
if slow progress in Russia despite the inhibiting conditions
under which this work is done.  Some valuable survey work
has involved various types of galaxies.  Now under way is a
complete spectroscopic survey of faint stars and galaxies in
selected areas of the sky, using a newly acquired CCD
manufactured in St. Petersburg.  Afanasiev has designed a
new spectrograph that should offer much higher quantum
efficiency than the off-the-shelf Zeiss Jena equipment now
in use.</p>

<p>But if the telescope does indeed "work," why haven't we
heard more from it?  Certainly there have been longstanding
problems in getting modern detectors for the BTA, which are
only now being remedied.  The lack of widely known results,
though, owes almost as much to other factors.  Some of this
work was published originally in English to attract wider
attention, but in a style sufficiently different from ours
that they went largely unnoticed.  The results do appear in
the Russian-language journals <i>Astrofizika</i>  and
<i>Astronomicheskii Zhurnal</i>, but these aren't always available
in translation, and few libraries subscribe to all of the
relevant series.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Western authors usually provide fuller details
of the observations and their quality than their Russian
colleagues do, which has led to suspicions that lack of
information is a cover-up for poor data.  Early on, one
often heard anecdotes of marginal BTA data that had been
overinterpreted.  However, such cases should be a thing of
the past now that digital detectors are in regular use.</p>

<p>Finally, the scientific emphases of our differing
astronomical communities can give the impression that
research not in vogue at a certain time is vaguely
irrelevant.  Since communication with the Commonwealth
republics is now more open, perhaps we can look forward to a
richer and more unified approach to astronomy.</p>

<p>However, my Russian colleagues face an uphill battle.  After
the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Academy of Sciences
fell under Russian control after a brief but intense debate.
These days getting the "hard" (convertible) currency from
the Academy to buy anything Western -- even professional
journals -- is next to impossible.  Those on the SAO
professional staff tell me their jobs are secure for <the> time
being, but at other astronomical facilities outside of
Russia there is frequent talk of nationalization and
outright mothballing. 
My hope is that despite these
impediments the astronomers there can continue to perform
valuable, world-class research.</p>
  
<center> <font size="+1">The BTA's Performance: How Good, How Bad?</font></center>

<p><a href="btasignsx.jpg"><img src="btasignsxs.jpg" align=left height=400 width=500
alt="Moscow 1890 km"></a>After the 6-meter telescope's completion in the mid-1970's,
rumors began circulating almost immediately about the sorry
state of its optics and the chronically poor atmospheric
seeing that enveloped the observatory.  In fact, the saga of
the BTA even made it into James Oberg's 1988 book <i>Uncovering
Soviet Disasters</i>.</p>

<p>The original mirror indeed had significant imperfections -
including cracks covered with black cloth - attributed to
the Russians' inexperience with such large optics.
According to Bagrat K. Ioannisiani, the telescope's chief
designer, the flawed Pyrex primary directed 61 percent of
the incoming light into a 0.5-arc-second circle and 91
percent into one with twice the diameter.  A second Pyrex
mirror, with an improved figure and no cracks, was installed
in 1978.  SAO astronomers have struggled for years to
replace it with one of low-expansion Sitall glass, and at
last word they expect it to be ready this year.</p>

<p>Thermal effects are so significant in the 42-ton primary
that it can tolerate only a 2-degree Celsius change per day and still
retain a usable figure.  If the temperatures of the primary
and the outside air differ by even 10 degrees, observations become
impossible.  This touchy situation has been ameliorated
somewhat by the installation of round-the-clock
refrigeration inside the dome.  On the rare occasions when
both atmospheric turbulence and temperature variations are
small, the telescope has delivered images of 1 arc second or
better.</p>

<p>The BTA does not enjoy a site comparable to those in Arizona
or California, much less La Palma or Mauna Kea.  It is often
in the turbulent downwind wake of nearby peaks higher up in
the Caucasus range.  This degrades the seeing and introduces
pointing restrictions when the wind exceeds about 45 km per
hour.  The geography makes for rather unstable local
weather, with strong year-to-year fluctuations.  Usable
nights per month can range from none to 20 - even for the
same month in different years.  On average observing takes
place on fewer than half of the nights throughout the year.</p>

<p>Ironically, better sites within the Soviet Union had been
identified during 16 expeditions conducted around 1960.  But
most of these are in Central Asia, locations so remote that
the logistical problems of constructing such a major
facility would have been formidable.  Nevertheless, the site
finally chosen is quite dark, and one can see the snow-capped 
Caucasus peaks by starlight and outlined by the Milky
Way.</p>

<p>Aside from the poor seeing present at the site itself,
Russian astronomers admit that the 6-meter's dome itself
degrades image quality significantly.  Forty-seven meters
high, it is big enough for a 15- to 25-meter short-focus
instrument.  In fact, SAO astronomers note with chagrin that
the telescope clears the dome's ceiling by 12 meters!  
Given this oversize cocoon of metal, with its considerable
thermal inertia, it's little wonder that 2-arc-second images
are classed as good seeing.  One internal SAO report states
that observers can count on 1.5-arc-second images only 10
percent of the time. 
This compares poorly with sites like
Mauna Kea, whose telescopes routinely perform at half that
value.</p>

World's Largest Astronomical Telescope

<center>
Cherkessk 1978</center>

<p> Astronomy is a national science. Beginning in the 17h century, it started as
a practical one, when astronomy grappled with problems of navigation. The 
second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries saw a period of enormous cosmic
discovery and enormous progress in the basic sciences. In recent decades, all 
the major governments have begun to provide great resources for astronomy,
invested in large telescopes and observatories. Many physicists and 
mathematicians apply their talents to the observations of physical properties 
of cosmic space. Only in the Universe, the ultimate laboratory, is it possible
to observe the most powerful physical processes, employing fantastic energies
impossible to replicate on a terrestrial scale. Many of these observed
processes are still inexplicable to contemporary physics. And still, one
knows that sooner or later these will be brought to practical application.
</p>

<p> The pace of astronomy, as in any other field of science driven primarily 
by experiment, requires powerful telescopes, the newest light 
detectors, measurement and computing technologies. These requirements
led the USSR Academy of Sciences to decide upon the construction of
a 6-meter optical telescope (BTA), the world's largest, and a 600-meter radio
telescope (RATAN-600), and upon these foundations, the Special Astrophysical 
Observatory of the USSR Academy of Sciences. So remarkable was the work of 
chief designer Lenin prize holder B.K. Ioannisian - the 6-meter primary
mirror - that his ideas foresaw present capabilities, based upon current
possibilities and determining the size of the telescope. Work on the
giant telescope and observatory was begun in 1959 at the Main Astronomical
Observatory at Pulkovo. To select the site for its installation, 16
expeditions were dispatched to various regions of the USSR. The construction
and equipping of the telescope were assigned to the Leningrad Optical-Mechanical
Works (LOMO) and other specialized organizations. The basic feature of
the telescope - the parabolic mirror - was settled during these preparations
as well.
</p>

<p> As a result of extensive selection, the decision was made to locate the 6-meter
telescope in the North Caucasus mountains near Zelenchukskaya at a height of
2100 meters above sea level.  This region is distinguished by good seeing,
high atmospheric transparency, and a sufficient number of clear nights. This
region also appeared satisfactory for the RATAN-600. No small role was played
by the consideration that the region selected should have sufficient
industrial potential for construction of the observatory and both normal
and further functions. (complicated statement about sufficiency of local
economy and support skipped)
</p>

<p> The Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) was established along the lines
of a scientific research institute by the Presidium of the USSR Academy
of Sciences on 3 June 1966. The original director was Doctor of Physical-
Mathematical Sciences I.M. Kopylev.</p>

<p> 
The first images were obtained with the BTA on 28 and 29 December 1975. Thus
was fulfilled a 15-year task of many collectives within the USSR. In January
1977 the 6-meter telescope went into regular scientific observations.
</p>

<p> The BTA is a general astronomical instrument, equipped to address the 
resolution of long-standing astrophysical puzzles. A mirror of this
area collects sufficient light to allow observations of
faint and distant objects in the Universe. The BTA is installed in a building of
diameter 48 meters and height 45 meters, of which the rotating dome weighs
1000 tons.</p>

<p> An outstanding characteristic of the BTA is its altazimuth mounting (as
on a theodolite), allowing it to point at any desired area of the sky,
pivoting about vertical and horizontal axes. Up to this time optical
telescopes have primarily used equatorial mountings, in which one of the axes 
of the telescope was in the direction of the Earth's pole, parallel to
the axis of Earth's rotation. An altazimuth mounting allows the existence
of improved telescopes, making them more compact. Nevertheless the
moving weight of the telscope is 650 tons, of the mirror alone 42
tones, and of the mirror with its support system 80 tons. Using the
telescope to study of objects which appear to move because of the
Earth's rotation requires electric motors and the help of specialized 
electronic computers. It is necessary to have a complex system connected
with the motions of stars across the sky with respect to one another.
Therefore the motions of the telescope about horizontal and vertical
axes proceed at varying rates, controlled at every instant by the
calculating equipment. The error in motion cannot exceed one second
of arc per second of time. Despite the great accuracy of the mechanical
work, the telescope departs from the ideal due to such factors as
mechanical flexure, temperature variations, wind loading, etc.
Therefore a "photo-guiding" system is used to correct the motion of the
telescope using the stars themselves.
</p>

<p> The BTA is equipped with a variety of light-sensitive apparatus, allowing the
intensification of weak light and its analysis for the physical properties of
celestial objects. The apparatus may be installed at four locations - the prime
focus, on both platforms, and within one of the mounting pillars.  At the
prime focus (24 meters) an observing cabin is installed, within which are
set detectors. The platforms hold spectrographs along horizontal axes
for spectra of stars and other objects. One carries the Basic stellar
spectrograph, one of whose optical elements has a 2-meter diameter (as in
the mirror of a fairly large telescope). The light to each platform is folded
by a diagonal mirror.
