<H1>UniBond League (Northern Premier League)</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1968</H2>
<P>In 1968 the leading semi-professional clubs joined together to form the
Northern Premier League to improve standards and allow a stronger case to be put
forward when applying for Football League membership. The idea for a top class
league in the North, similar to the Southern League, had been mooted for several
years. In 1966 a steering commitee was set up at which over 200 clubs were
represented from the six top leagues, and from them 20 clubs were chosen to form
the new League. Membership was restricted to professional clubs only and it was
agreed that each year the champions of the Cheshire County League, Lancashire
Combination and Midland League would replace the bottom three clubs.</P>

<H2>Area Covered</H2>
<P>The Unibond League covers the North of the country, the boundary with the
<A HREF="docmarten.html">Dr. Marten's League</A> is roughly between Stoke and
Stafford in the West and Boston and King's Lynn in the East.</P>
<H2>Structure</H2>
<P>2 divisions, 45 clubs<BR><A HREF="#nplp">Premier Division</A> (23 clubs)<BR><A
HREF="#npl1">Division One</A> (22 clubs)</P>
<P>Until 1987 the league consisted of a single division and membership varied
from 22 to 24 clubs depending on the availability of new clubs to replace the
occasional defunct member. A secondary division was formed in 1987 amidst much
acrimony from the three feeder leagues who lost several of their top teams.</P>
