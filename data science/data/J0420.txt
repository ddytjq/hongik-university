      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">WATKINS GLEN- Jackie Stewart returned Friday, June 4, to
      a place of triumph and tragedy.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">Standing in the new Watkins Glen Motor Racing Research
      Library the racing legend recalled moments that have brought him great joy in Watkins
      Glen, as well as moments of great sorrow.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">But the occasion of his visit was one of pure joy and
      celebration as he officially opened the research library, culminating more than two years
      of effort.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">The library, adjacent to the Watkins Glen Public Library,
      is considered to be the only of its kind in the world - an archival library dedicated
      solely to motor sports of all kinds.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">The library opened to the public at 9 a.m. Saturday.
      Hours will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">&quot;This is a tremendous asset to the whole motor
      racing community,&quot; Stewart said, referring to the people and businesses that donated
      the almost $1 million to build and operate the two story facility. No local tax dollars
      were or will be used, library officials pledged.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">&quot;It's been rightly said that people will come from
      far and wide,&quot; Stewart said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">He noted that it has been generally hard to research
      motor sports. Not any more. Stewart said the curious and the serious will come, and they
      will be followed by more and more donations of material.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">&quot;There's enough for everybody here,&quot; said the
      three-time world champion and twice winner of the Watkins Glen Grand Prix.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">Stewart retired as a Formula One competitor at Watkins
      Glen in 1972, after the death of his teammate, Francois Cevert.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">His memories of Watkins Glen are strong and good, Stewart
      said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">Staying at the Glen Motor Inn on this visit was
      reminiscent of the Grand Prix days when everyone who was anyone stayed there. You really
      had to be someone special to get a table in the restaurant on Saturday night before the
      race, Stewart recalled.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">&quot;What a place that was! There wasn't a leading
      driver in the world who hadn't stayed at the Glen Motor Inn.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">And then there was the Bog, a word Watkins Glen
      International officials still shudder over.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">&quot;I'm very sad that the Bog was taken away,&quot; he
      said, while describing the unruly behavior of that long-gone section of the track
      property.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">&quot;There was a great spirit at Watkins Glen. There was
      passion,&quot; Stewart said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">It was a passion noticed by all who came, he said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial, helvetica">Now, with the Motor Racing Research Library, many more
      can come and experience it through the books, films, posters, and other items.</font></p>

    Opening</b></font><p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">Patrick Buchnowski of the Corning Leader</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">Watkins Glen -- After three years of planning, much
      fanfare and anticipation, the Watkins Glen Motor Racing Research Library opened Friday
      with ceremonies that included library officials, supporters and a visit from three-time
      world driving champion Jackie Stewart.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">Stewart, who won the United States Grand Prix at Watkins
      Glen in 1968 and 1972, said Watkins Glen is known worldwide as the mecca of motor racing.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;Watkins Glen ... you don't realize the impact of
      those two names around the world,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;There is no place that I'd
      rather go for any major motor racing event. There is no one in the five continents that we
      travel or the 15 countries that we race in that would not know Watkins Glen.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">On hand for the opening ceremonies were John Bishop, who
      founded the International Motor Sports Association, to whom the library was dedicated;
      Bryan Sperber, president of Watkins Glen International; Jean Argetsinger, library
      president; and Phil McCray, library director and curator.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">From the steps inside the 5000 square foot facility
      adjacent to the Watkins Glen Public Library, Stewart praised organizers for their vision
      to build a facility housing more than 50 years of racing history.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">It includes a growing collection of 2000 rare and
      reference books, manuscript collections, race program and poster collections, periodicals,
      and a film and print room for viewing rare historical race footage. The library also has
      its own website at www.racingarchives.org.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;There are many museums of cars around the world
      where people can either go to show respect to the sport or see some of the memorabilia
      that is collected,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;But what you've got here, to have archives
      and have real research available is, I think, a tremendous asset to the whole racing
      community.&quot; Stewart, chairman of the Stewart-Ford Formula One racing team, reflected
      on memorable times, including his stays at the Glen Motor Inn, a motel and restaurant
      still owned by the Franzese family.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;There wasn't a leading driver in the world who
      hasn't stayed in the Glen Motor Inn,&quot; he said. &quot;The day before a race, we all
      felt privileged when they found a wee table for us somewhere.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">Memories of the race track linger like a fresh scent to
      the Scots-born driver credited with increasing the attention and popularity of motor
      racing.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;Watkins Glen is a place that's been kind to me, to
      win the Grand Prix of the United States, and I still have the trophy,&quot; he said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;It's an ideal punch bowl,&quot; he joked.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">The opening of the library means race fans and scholars
      will have a place to trace the history of racing,&quot; McCray said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;As an archival center, we will house rare and
      historically valuable materials in an environment meeting the highest standards of
      archival storage,&quot; he said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">As the racing world becomes familiar with the library,
      more memorabilia will be added, Stewart predicted.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;So don't think the job is over - you will find that
      one day it will have to be expanded, Stewart said of the library. &quot;The sport should
      be very proud.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">Spearheaded by Argetsinger and John R. Saunders, former
      WGI president who is now vice president of International Speedway Corporation, the library
      is everything organizers imagined, Argetsinger said.</font></p>
      <p><font FACE="arial,helvetica">&quot;We raised $1 million,&quot; she said. &quot;The
      response has come from the motor racing world.&quot;</font></p>
