ABSTRACT:  We showed previously that 3 distal inhibitors of cholesterol
synthesis are highly teratogenic in rats. AY 9944 and BM 15766 inhibit
7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which catalyzes the last step of cholesterol
synthesis, and triparanol inhibits Delta(24)-dehydrocholesterol reductase,
which catalyzes the last step in another pathway. These molecules cause
holoprosencephalic brain anomalies. Under certain experimental conditions,
other anomalies (of the limbs and male genitalia) are also observed. Assays
performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) show
hypocholesterolemia and an accumulation of precursors. These data indicate that
this animal model can be considered a model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a recessive autosomal genetic disease
characterized by malformations (microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis,
holoprosencephaly, and mental retardation), male pseudohermaphroditism, finger
anomalies, and failure to thrive. The syndrome has been attributed to a deficit
in 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. As assayed by GC-MS, the sterol status of
these patients indicates severe hypocholesterolemia and an accumulation of
precursors: 7-dehydrocholesterol, 8-dehydrocholesterol, and oxidized
derivatives. The presence of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the serum of patients is
pathognomonic of the disease. The developmental gene Shh (sonic hedgehog) plays
a key role in brain, limb, and genital development; it was shown recently that
the Shh protein has to be covalently linked to cholesterol to be active. This
is the first time that a posttranslational function has been attributed to
cholesterol. There is an obvious relation between Shh dysfunction and the
malformations observed in our experiments and in patients with
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. However, the exact relation remains to be
clarified. It is clear, however, that the role of cholesterol in embryonic
development must be taken into account.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic pathway, and the sterol
pathway which is prerequisite to the BR pathway, are rapidly being
characterized because of the availability of a large number of characteristic
dwarf mutants in Arabidopsis. Here we show that the Arabidopsis dwarf5 mutants
are disrupted in a sterol Delta7 reduction step. dwf5 plants display the
characteristic dwarf phenotype typical of other BR mutants. This phenotype
includes small, round, dark-green leaves, and short stems, pedicels, and
petioles. Metabolite tracing with 13C-labeled precursors in dwf5 verified a
deficiency in a sterol Delta7 reductase activity. All six independent alleles
contain loss-of-function mutations in the sterol Delta7 reductase gene. These
include a putative mRNA instability mutation in dwf5-1, 3' and 5' splice-site
mutations in dwf5-2 and dwf5-6, respectively, premature stop codons in dwf5-3
(R400Z) and dwf5-5 (R409Z), and a mis-sense mutation in dwf5-4 (D257N). The
dwf5 plant could be restored to wild type by ectopic overexpression of the
wild-type copy of the gene. Both the Arabidopsis dwf5 phenotype and the human
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome are caused by loss-of-function mutations in a sterol
Delta7 reductase gene, indicating that it is required for the proper growth and
development of these two organisms.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), an autosomal recessive condition
with multiple malformations, mental retardation, and growth failure, results
from markedly reduced activity of the final enzyme in the cholesterol
biosynthetic pathway, 7-dehydrocholesterol Delta(7)-reductase (DHCR7). We
diagnosed SLOS in a fetus following intrauterine demise at 32 weeks' gestation.
Chorionic villus (CV) sampling had been performed at 30 weeks because
oligohydramnios and atrioventricular septal defect were noted on fetal
ultrasound. On fetal post-mortem examination, a midline U-shaped soft palate
cleft, micrognathia, postaxial polydactyly of the fingers with single
transverse palmar creases bilaterally, and cutaneous syndactyly of toes
two-three bilaterally suggested SLOS. We hypothesized that SLOS could be
confirmed by analysis of tissue sterols despite extensive autolysis, and by
measurement of enzyme activity in CV cells. Measurement of DHCR7 activity in CV
cells was undertaken using ergosterol as a substrate. CV cells were unable to
convert any ergosterol to brassicasterol after a 72 h incubation period while
control CV cells reduced 12.6-71.8% of ergosterol to brassciasterol in a 72 h
period. SLOS was confirmed by measurement of elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol
(7-DHC) in the CV cells. Measurements of sterols were made in multiple fetal
tissues. All tissues analysed showed elevated 7-DHC with markedly increased
7-DHC/cholesterol ratios. Copyright 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by minor facial anomalies, mental retardation, and multiple
congenital abnormalities. Biochemically, the disorder is caused by deficient
activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of
the Delta7 double bond of 7-dehydrocholesterol to produce cholesterol.
Recently, mutations in the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (7DHCR)
were found to cause SLOS. We report the first molecular characterization of an
Italian SLOS patient. Interestingly, his paternal 7DHCR allele, of Arab origin,
harbored a novel P329L mutation which in combination with a maternal
splice-site (IVS8-1 G&gt;C) mutation resulted in a relatively milder phenotype.

ABSTRACT:  The RSH or Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a relatively common
autosomal recessive disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis resulting from a
deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol delta7-reductase (7-DHCR).
Mutations in 7-DHCR gene cause SLOS. Among these, a G--&gt;C transversion in
the splice acceptor site of exon 9 (IVS8-1G--&gt;C) was suspected to be a
frequent mutation, having been detected in about 18% of SLOS patients so far.
This mutation results in the elimination of a AlwN1 restriction endonuclease
site. We report a simple PCR-RFLP assay to detect the IVS8-1G--&gt;C mutation.
Using this method, we identified the IVS8-1G--&gt;C mutation in 21 of 33 SLOS
propositi. This mutation was detected in one of 90 normal adult Caucasian
Americans; but not among 121 Africans from Sierra Leone, 120 Caucasians from
Finland, 95 Chinese or 103 Japanese adults. The results of this study provide
further evidence that IVS8-1G--&gt;C transversion is a very common mutation in
SLOS patients from the US and that the carrier rate in US caucasians may be
high. The simple PCR-RFLP assay developed makes identification of this mutation
convenient for diagnosis and for carrier detection.<p>

ABSTRACT:  For many years the study of Red Blood Cell (RBC) deformability has
been limited to specialised hematological research institutes and this has
hampered a widespread clinical testing of this dynamic RBC property.
Consequently, the clinical relevance of such in vitro measurements has remained
questionable now for a considerable time. The recent availability of the LORCA,
a routinely applicable and computer assisted instrument for this purpose, opens
now the possibility to evaluate RBC deformability on a large scale in various
pathological situations associated with impaired microcirculatory flow. In this
communication we present our clinical experience obtained thusfar with this
instrument. Besides the effect of physiological aging of normal RBC, the
results of a clinical study on malaria tropica, case studies of hereditary
elliptocytosis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (a cholesterol biosynthesis defect),
the treatment of sickle cell crisis with hydroxy-urea as well as the clinical
intervention with Cyclosporin, are collected. In conclusion, it can be stated
that the limited clinical experience with the LORCA as is reported here, yields
sufficient evidence about the clinical potential of this technique.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), an autosomal recessive
malformation syndrome, ranges in clinical severity from mild dysmorphism and
moderate mental retardation to severe congenital malformation and intrauterine
lethality. Mutations in the gene for Delta7-sterol reductase (DHCR7), which
catalyzes the final step in cholesterol biosynthesis in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), cause SLOS. We have determined, in 84 patients with clinically
and biochemically characterized SLOS (detection rate 96%), the mutational
spectrum in the DHCR7 gene. Forty different SLOS mutations, some frequent, were
identified. On the basis of mutation type and expression studies in the
HEK293-derived cell line tsA-201, we grouped mutations into four classes:
nonsense and splice-site mutations resulting in putative null alleles, missense
mutations in the transmembrane domains (TM), mutations in the 4th cytoplasmic
loop (4L), and mutations in the C-terminal ER domain (CT). All but one of the
tested missense mutations reduced protein stability. Concentrations of the
cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol and clinical severity scores
correlated with mutation classes. The mildest clinical phenotypes were
associated with TM and CT mutations, and the most severe types were associated
with 0 and 4L mutations. Most homozygotes for null alleles had severe SLOS; one
patient had a moderate phenotype. Homozygosity for 0 mutations in DHCR7 appears
compatible with life, suggesting that cholesterol may be synthesized in the
absence of this enzyme or that exogenous sources of cholesterol can be used.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Opitz G/BBB syndrome (OS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder
with an X-linked locus and an autosomal locus linked to 22q11.2. OS affects
multiple organ systems with often variable severity even between siblings. The
clinical features, which include hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, defects
of cardiac septation, hypospadias, and anorectal anomalies, indicate an
underlying disturbance of the developing ventral midline of the embryo. The
gene responsible for X-linked OS, FXY/MID1, is located on the short arm of the
human X chromosome within Xp22.3 and encodes a protein with both an RBCC (RING
finger, B-box, coiled coil) and a B30.2 domain. The Fxy gene in mice is also
located on the X chromosome but spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in this
species. Here we describe a gene closely related to FXY/MID1, called FXY2,
which also maps to the X chromosome within Xq22. The mouse Fxy2 gene is located
on the distal part of the mouse X chromosome within a region syntenic to Xq22.
Analysis of genes flanking both FXY/MID1 and FXY2 (as well as their
counterparts in mouse) suggests that these regions may have arisen as a result
of an intrachromosomal duplication on an ancestral X chromosome. We have also
identified in both FXY2 and FXY/MID1 proteins a conserved fibronectin type III
domain located between the RBCC and B30.2 domains that has implications for
understanding protein function. The FXY/MID1 protein has previously been shown
to colocalize with microtubules, and here we show that the FXY2 protein
similarly associates with microtubules in a manner that is dependent on the
carboxy-terminal B30.2 domain. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Photosensitivity has recently been reported as a feature of the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO). The aim of this study was to establish the
photobiological features of this disorder and to examine the hypothesis that
the photosensitivity is caused by the high levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol found
in SLO. All known cases of SLO in the U.K. were reviewed and clinical details
of photosensitivity were recorded in detail. The action spectrum of the
photosensitive eruption was defined by monochromator light testing. Thirteen of
the 23 subjects (57%) had severe photosensitivity, and in 10 there was no
photosensitivity. No correlation was identified between levels of
7-dehydrocholesterol and severity of photosensitivity, suggesting that the
photosensitivity in SLO is not caused by a direct phototoxic effect mediated by
7-dehydrocholesterol. A novel pattern of photosensitivity was observed, with
onset of a sunburn-like erythema on sun-exposed skin within minutes of sun
exposure, which persisted in most cases for up to 24-48 h before fading.
Monochromator light testing in three subjects showed an ultraviolet (UV)
A-mediated photosensitivity eruption with greatest photosensitivity at 350 nm.
Photosensitivity is a common and prominent feature of SLO and appears to be
UVA-mediated. Elucidation of its biochemical basis may provide insight into
normal cutaneous protective mechanisms against UVA-induced photodamage, and
also sun sensitivity in general.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive
disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis characterised by facial dysmorphisms,
mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies. SLOS is caused by
mutations of the human Delta7-sterol reductase (DHCR7) gene and, so far, 19
different mutations have been described. Among these, mutations impairing the
activity of the C-terminus appear to be the most severe. Here we report the
mutational analysis of the DHCR7 gene in nine Italian SLOS patients. The T93M
mutation, previously reported in one patient, results the most frequent one
(7/18 alleles) in our survey. Furthermore, we identified three novel mutations,
two missense mutations (N407Y and E448K), and a 33 bp deletion spanning part of
exon 5 and the donor splice site of intron 5.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive multiple
malformation disorder. A deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol delta
7-reductase (DHCR7) is the primary abnormality in SLOS. The gene encoding DHCR7
has been cloned, and we have identified a mutation affecting the splice
acceptor site 5' of exon 9 that occurs frequently in affected individuals. We
developed a novel PCR-based assay to detect this common mutation in DHCR7.
Using this assay, heterozygosity was detected for this mutation in 18 of 26 and
homozygosity in 1 of 26 unrelated affected individuals. The high frequency of
this mutation is suggestive of either a founder effect in our group of patients
or a mutational hotspot. The simplicity and reliability of this assay will
allow it to be used as a clinical test to aid in diagnosis of atypical cases,
in carrier testing, in prediction of prognosis based on genotype, and in
prenatal molecular genetic diagnostic testing.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Five unsaturated sterols relevant to the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome
have been prepared in high radiochemical purity with a tritium label at the
3alpha position. Swern oxidation of cholesta-5,8-dien-3beta-ol and other
unlabeled C27 sterols afforded the corresponding 3-ketosteroids, and reduction
with tritiated NaBH4 gave the desired 3alpha-3H sterols, with double bonds at
the delta(5,8), delta(5,8(14)), delta(6,8), delta(6,8(14)), and delta8
positions. High radiochemical purity of the tritiated sterols was demonstrated
by normal phase, reversed phase, and silver-ion (Ag+) high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). In the course of this work, we developed a
medium-pressure variant of Ag+-HPLC for purifying radiolabeled samples,
documented significant isotopic fractionation of the 3alpha-tritiated sterols
and their acetates on Ag+-HPLC, and discovered unexpected effects of a
delta(8(14)) bond on the conformation of 3-keto-delta5-steroids. The synthetic
and analytical methodologies described herein should provide a sound basis for
investigating the origin and metabolism of sterols involved in the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and in late stages of cholesterol biosynthesis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive
condition involving craniofacial and central nervous system malformations with
occasional holoprosencephaly (HPE). It is caused by a defect in the
7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the last step of
cholesterol biosynthesis. Treatment of pregnant rats with inhibitors of 7-DHC
reductase, either AY9944 or BM15.766, has provided a valuable model to study
the pathogenesis in SLOS. Recently, cholesterol has been shown to be involved
in the post-translational activation of the signaling protein Sonic Hedgehog.
To identify the early defects associated with HPE in a rat model of SLOS, and
to compare the phenotype of the treated embryos with that of the Shh(-/-)
mutants, we examined brain morphology and expression of three developmental
genes (Shh, Otx2, and Pax6 ) in 23-somite stage embryos from AY9944-treated
dams. We report clearly abnormal morphology of the developing brain, concerning
primarily the ventral aspect of the neural tube. We observed a reduced or
absent expression of Shh and Otx2 in their ventral domain associated with
extended ventral expression of Pax6. The results suggest an absence of the
midline ventral cell type at all levels of the cranial neural tube. They
provide further evidence that cholesterol-deficiency-induced HPE originates
from impaired Shh signaling activity in the ventral neural tube. Copyright 1999

ABSTRACT:  The pathogenesis of the development of ambiguous genitalia reported
in some 46,XY patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is not understood.
Presumably, it is related to the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase deficiency
present in these patients. In this study we have evaluated testicular function,
both in vivo and in vitro, in a 46,XY patient with ambiguous genitalia, reared
as a girl. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, low serum cholesterol
and high serum 7-dehydrocholesterol levels. Serum hormone values, determined
during the first month of age, showed normal basal testosterone (1.95 ng/ml),
LH (0.91 U/l) and FSH (2.51 U/l). However, serum testosterone did not increase
after hCG administration (1.98 ng/ml). On the other hand, the patient had a
positive biological response to exogenous testosterone (decrease in sex
hormone-binding globulin serum levels). She was orchidectomized at the age of
33 mo. Testicular cells were dispersed and maintained in culture for 6 d. These
cells showed a very good capacity to secrete testosterone into the culture
medium (X +/- SD, 26.1 +/- 11.7 vs. 4.36 +/- 1.70 pmol/10(6) cells/24 h in a
control group of testicular cells prepared from testes collected at necropsy).
The patient's cells failed to respond to LH stimulation (18.6 +/- 4.0
pmol/10(6) cells/24 h), although they did respond to other stimuli. It is
concluded that the severe cholesterol deficiency of this patient did not impair
the capacity of the testes to synthesize testosterone. However, the LH/hCG
receptor or its subsequent message was activated neither in vivo nor in vitro.
This finding suggests that the foetal testes might have failed to respond to
placental hCG at the time of male external genital differentiation. This
failure could have been responsible for the ambiguous genitalia present in this
patient.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Analysis of 600 kb of sequence encompassing the beta-prime adaptin
(BAM22) gene on human chromosome 22 revealed intrachromosomal duplications
within 22q12-13 resulting in three active RFPL genes, two RFPL pseudogenes, and
two pseudogenes of BAM22. The genomic sequence of BAM22vartheta1 shows a
remarkable similarity to that of BAM22. The cDNA sequence comparison of RFPL1,
RFPL2, and RFPL3 showed 95%-96% identity between the genes, which were most
similar to the Ret Finger Protein gene from human chromosome 6. The sense RFPL
transcripts encode proteins with the tripartite structure, composed of RING
finger, coiled-coil, and B30-2 domains, which are characteristic of the
RING-B30 family. Each of these domains are thought to mediate protein-protein
interactions by promoting homo- or heterodimerization. The MID1 gene on Xp22 is
also a member of the RING-B30 family and is mutated in Opitz syndrome (OS). The
autosomal dominant form of OS shows linkage to 22q11-q12. We detected a
polymorphic protein-truncating allele of RFPL1 in 8% of the population, which
was not associated with the OS phenotype. We identified 6-kb and 1.2-kb
noncoding antisense mRNAs of RFPL1S and RFPL3S antisense genes, respectively.
The RFPL1S and RFPL3S genes cover substantial portions of their sense
counterparts, which suggests that the function of RFPL1S and RFPL3S is a
post-transcriptional regulation of the sense RFPL genes. We illustrate the role
of intrachromosomal duplications in the generation of RFPL genes, which were
created by a series of duplications and share an ancestor with the RING-B30
domain containing genes from the major histocompatibility complex region on
human chromosome 6.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The biosynthetic abnormality in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is
a deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductase, the enzyme responsible
for catalyzing the final step in the Kandutsch-Russell pathway for cholesterol
synthesis. Because the disposition of 7DHC and 8-dehydrocholesterol [8DHC;
cholesta-5,8(9)-dien-3beta-ol] produced in this syndrome is little understood,
we have analyzed urine from three young infants by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry to characterize its steroid metabolites. All steroid metabolites
of adrenal origin found in normal infant urine were also found in urine from
the patients with SLOS but in reduced amount. Quantitatively, the major
steroids in these SLOS patients were identified by mass spectrometry as
homologs of normal neonatal steroids possessing an additional double bond.
Generally, two forms of each steroid were present in a similar amount. Because
of the markedly increased levels of 7DHC and 8DHC in SLOS, these almost
certainly represented the 5,7 and 5,8(9) unsaturated forms of each metabolite.
The most abundant steroids were tentatively identified as
3beta,16alpha-dihydroxy-5,7-pregnadien-20-one and
3beta,16alpha-dihydroxy-5,8(9)-pregnadien-20-one, although similar
21-hydroxylated steroids and homologs of 16alpha-hydroxy-DHEA were also found.
This study shows that all enzymatic steps used by cholesterol in the DHEA
synthetic pathway are also functional for 7DHC and 8DHC.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a malformation syndrome
associated with 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) 7-reductase deficiency. Although
SLOS can be detected in an affected fetus before midpregnancy by measurement of
7DHC levels in amniotic fluid or chorionic villus cells, a noninvasive, more
routine method is needed. Accordingly, this study was instigated to search for
specific steroids in maternal urine in an affected pregnancy that reflect the
7-reductase deficiency of the fetus, ie, steroids retaining 7,8-unsaturation.
Steroids were characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after
urinary extraction, conjugate separation, and derivatization. Most steroids in
maternal urine from a patient carrying a SLOS fetus were identified as
progesterone metabolites, and these were entirely conventional, showing no
evidence of additional unsaturation. Unsaturated homologues of the cortisol
metabolites were also not detected. However, unsaturated homologues of
pregnane-3,16,20-triols and pregnane-3,17,20-triol were found. Most likely,
these are 7,8-unsaturated homologues, but 8,9-unsaturation is also possible
because of the known activity of delta7-delta8-isomerase on 7DHC, which results
in 8DHC being a prominent sterol in SLOS. Among these novel human steroids, the
following were provisionally characterized: 5beta-pregn-7(or
8)-ene-3alpha,17alpha,20alpha-triol, 5beta-pregn-7(or
8)-ene-3alpha,16alpha,20alpha-triol, and 5alpha-pregn-7(or
8)-ene-3,16alpha,20alpha-triol. Confirmation of the position of unsaturation
will require steroid synthesis. These novel steroids are not present in normal
pregnancy urine and, therefore, are valuable for prenatal diagnosis of SLOS. In
addition, separate studies have shown that 5beta-pregn-7(or
8)-ene-3alpha,17alpha,20alpha-triol is present in urine of children and adults
with SLOS, and so is a useful analyte for confirmation of the disorder
throughout life.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In 1993 the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome, known as a
malformation syndrome characterized by certain stigma, turned out to be a
metabolic disease with a defect in the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis.
This led to the possibility of identifying affected individuals by biochemical
methods and of increasing understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Hopes of
influencing the effects of the metabolic defect by dietary supplementation were
raised and reports with some benefits of treatment have been published. This is
a report of a 12-y-old girl with the SLO syndrome in an apparently progressive
form. In addition to typical signs and well-known symptoms she has a verified
polyneuropathy and precocious puberty. She has been treated with cholesterol
and bile acids for 3 y, during which time the progressive course has been
arrested. A notable effect has been the improvement of her polyneuropathy,
verified by measurement of nerve conduction velocities. Possible mechanisms
involved in the pathogenesis of her precocious puberty are discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The atrioventricular canal defect (AVCD) is one of the congenital
heart defects most frequently associated with extracardiac anomalies. The
association of AVCD with Down syndrome and heterotaxy has been studied
extensively. However, little information is available about the prevalence of
genetic syndromes and additional cardiac malformations in patients with AVCD
and visceroatrial situs solitus without Down syndrome. This paper reviews the
genetic and cardiologic characteristics of patients with non-Down AVCD and
situs solitus in the literature and our series of 203 consecutive patients. In
our experience, 132 (65%) of the patients have nonsyndromic AVCD, while 71
(35%) have non-Down syndromic AVCD. Chromosomal imbalances were detected in 7
cases (3%), Mendelian syndromes or associations in 44 (22%), and extracardiac
anomalies without an identifiable syndrome in 20 (10%). Deletion 8p is
prevalent among those with chromosomal imbalances. Noonan, Ellis-van Creveld,
oro-faciodigital, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndromes and VACTERL cases are frequent
among patients with recognizable or identifiable nonchromosomal conditions.
Based on this analysis of the type of AVCD and prevalence of associated cardiac
anomalies in the different groups of patients, we found that: 1) the complete
form is prevalent in patients with chromosomal imbalances; 2) the complete form
is more frequently associated with additional cardiac defects, mainly left side
obstructive lesions; and 3) additional cardiac anomalies are prevalent in
syndromic patients. In conclusion, AVCD is a congenital heart defect with great
variability in the anatomic patterns and heterogeneity of causes also in the
subset without Down syndrome and without heterotaxy. The peculiar anatomic
subtypes of this cardiac defect are associated with specific genetic
conditions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a congenital birth defect
syndrome caused by a deficiency of 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta(7)-reductase, the
final enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The patients have reduced
plasma and tissue cholesterol concentrations with the accumulation of
7-dehydrocholesterol and 8-dehydrocholesterol. Bile acid synthesis is reduced
and unnatural cholenoic and cholestenoic acids have been identified in some
SLOS patients. To explore the mechanism of the abnormal bile acid production,
the activities of key enzymes in classic and alternative bile acid biosynthetic
pathways (microsomal cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and mitochondrial sterol
27-hydroxylase) were measured in liver biopsy specimens from two mildly
affected SLOS patients. The effects of 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterols on these
two enzyme activities were studied by using liver from SLOS model rats that
were treated with the Delta(7)-reductase inhibitor (BM15.766) for 4 months and
were comparable with more severe SLOS phenotype in plasma and hepatic sterol
compositions. In the SLOS patients, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and sterol
27-hydroxylase were not defective. In BM15.766-treated rats, both enzyme
activities were lower than those in control rats and they were competitively
inhibited by 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterols. Rat microsomal cholesterol
7alpha-hydroxylase did not transform 7-dehydrocholesterol or
8-dehydrocholesterol into 7alpha-hydroxylated sterols. In contrast, rat
mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzed 27-hydroxylation of 7- and
8-dehydrocholesterols, which were partially converted to
3beta-hydroxycholestadienoic acids. Addition of microsomes to the mitochondrial
27-hydroxylase assay mixture reduced 27-hydroxydehydrocholesterol
concentrations, which suggested that 27-hydroxydehydrocholesterols were further
metabolized by microsomal enzymes. These results suggest that reduced normal
bile acid production is characteristic of severe SLOS phenotype and is caused
not only by depletion of hepatic cholesterol but also by competitive inhibition
of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase activities by
accumulated 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterols. Unnatural bile acids are synthesized
mainly by the alternative pathway via mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase in
SLOS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Now known as a Garrodian inborn error caused by the homozygous state
of many different autosomal recessive mutations of the 7-dehydrocholesterol
reductase gene leading to deficient conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to
cholesterol, the RSH (so-called Smith-Lemli-Opitz) syndrome has become a
paradigmatic metabolic malformation syndrome in a pathway that also involves
cause and pathogenesis of desmosterolosis, two forms of the
Conradi-Hunermann-Happle type chondodysplasia punctata and its mouse homologs,
and the Greenberg "moth-eaten" skeletal dysplasia and the CHILD syndrome. Many
other defects in this pathway remain to be discovered.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The B-box family is an expanding new family of genes encoding
proteins involved in diverse cellular functions such as developmental
patterning and oncogenesis. A member of this protein family, MID1, is the gene
responsible for the X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome, a developmental
disorder characterized by defects of the midline structures. We now report the
identification of MID2, a new transcript closely related to MID1. MID2 maps to
Xq22 in human and to the syntenic region on the mouse X chromosome. The two
X-linked genes share the same domains, the same exon-intron organization, a
high degree of similarity at the protein level and the same subcellular
localization, both being confined to the cytoplasm in association to
micro-tubular structures. The expression pattern studied by RNA in situ
hybridization in mouse revealed that Mid2 is expressed early in development and
the highest level of expression is detected in the heart, unlike Mid1 for which
no expression was detected in the developing heart. Together, these data
suggest that midin and MID2 have a similar biochemical function but a different
physiological role during development.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Opitz syndrome (OS) is a multiple congenital anomaly manifested by
abnormal closure of midline structures. The gene responsible for the X-linked
form of this disease, MID1, encodes a protein (midin) that contains a RING, two
B-boxes, a coiled-coil (the so-called tripartite motif) and an RFP-like domain.
The tripartite motif is characteristic of a family of proteins, named the B-box
family, involved in cell proliferation and development. Since the subcellular
compartmentalization and the ability to form multiprotein structures both
appear to be crucial for the function of this family of proteins, we have
studied these properties on the wild-type and mutated forms of midin. We found
that endogenous midin is associated with microtubules throughout the cell
cycle, co-localizing with cytoplasmic fibres in interphase and with the mitotic
spindle and midbodies during mitosis and cytokinesis. Immunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated the ability of the tripartite motif to mediate midin
homodimerization, consistent with the evidence, obtained by gel filtration
analysis, that midin exists in the form of large protein complexes. Functional
characterization of altered forms of midin, resulting from mutations found in
OS patients, revealed that association with microtubules is compromised, while
the ability to homodimerize and form multiprotein complexes is retained. We
suggest that midin is involved in the formation of multiprotein structures
acting as anchor points to microtubules and that impaired association with
these cytoskeletal structures causes OS developmental defects.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO or RSH) syndrome is characterized by multiple
congenital anomalies, mental retardation, and defective growth; it results from
an inherited defect in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Patients have elevated
plasma concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol, the immediate biosynthetic
precursor of cholesterol and most also have low circulating levels of
cholesterol. To understand better the biochemical basis of clinical
variability, we evaluated cholesterol biosynthesis in lymphoblasts from 3
unrelated SLOS patients with distinct phenotypes. One patient has "type I
SLOS", the second has the more severe "type II SLOS" and the third is
classified as atypical and had been postulated to have a defect in sterol
transport. The lymphoblasts of each patient show normal subcellular
localization of cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol by gradient fractionation.
Biochemical differences in the ability of the lymphoblasts to convert
7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol are described and correspond to the
severity of disease (type II &gt; type I &gt; atypical). Recently, the gene
responsible for most SLOS cases (DHCR7) was mapped to chromosome 11 and
mutations in DHCR7 were found in each of these patients. The biochemical
differences described here likely result from the different mutations observed
in DHCR7. Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a syndrome of multiple malformations and
mental retardation that for years was relegated to the atlases of genetic
esoterica, was recently found to be a relatively common inborn error of
metabolism. The underlying defect is absent or deficient activity of
7-dehydrocholesterol- delta 7-reductase, the enzyme catalysing the final step
of cholesterol synthesis. The discovery of the biochemical defect causing
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome has resulted in the development of a diagnostic test
and a potentially beneficial treatment (dietary cholesterol supplementation).
Infants and young children with the syndrome have shown marked improvement in
growth, behaviour and general health after receiving cholesterol therapy; older
children and adults have shown some improvement in development and intellectual
functioning. Despite the excitement these developments have elicited among
geneticists and biochemists, this syndrome remains relatively unknown to many
primary care physicians. Increased awareness of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is
needed to identify affected patients so that they and their families can
benefit from appropriate treatment and genetic counselling.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVES: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a recessively
inherited disorder caused by an inborn error of cholesterol metabolism that
results in deficiency of cholesterol and accumulation of the cholesterol
precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHC) and its epimer, 8-DHC. Affected patients
present with congenital anomalies, growth restriction, and mental retardation.
Postnatal treatment with cholesterol supplementation has been shown to improve
plasma sterol levels and has resulted in improved growth and development in
many patients. We hypothesized that prenatal supplementation of cholesterol
could potentially arrest some of the adverse consequences of cholesterol
deficiency at an earlier stage of development. METHODS: SLOS was diagnosed in
the third trimester in a fetus initially identified by sonography with
intrauterine growth restriction and ambiguous genitalia and confirmed by
elevated levels of 7- and 8-DHC in amniotic fluid. Antenatal supplementation of
cholesterol was provided by fetal intravenous and intraperitoneal transfusions
of fresh frozen plasma (cholesterol level = 219 mg/dl). RESULTS: The in utero
transfusions resulted in increased levels of fetal cholesterol, as measured in
blood samples obtained by cordocentesis. In addition, fetal red cell mean
corpuscular volume rose, which further indicated that the exogenous cholesterol
was incorporated into the fetal erythrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal treatment
of SLOS by cholesterol supplementation is feasible and results in improvement
in fetal plasma cholesterol levels and fetal red cell volume. SLOS may be added
to the growing list of human genetic disorders for which prenatal diagnosis is
available and therapeutic intervention may be possible.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a disorder of morphogenesis
resulting from an enzymatic defect in the last step of cholesterol metabolism
(reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol). Analysis of the defective gene and
identification of mutations therein have paved the way for the study of the
molecular genetics of the disorder which is caused by numerous different
mutations. Future efforts should identify a postulated intracellular signalling
activity of sterol intermediates, isolate proteins that govern the sterol
traffic between intracellular compartments, structurally characterize the
enzyme delta 7-sterol reductase defective in the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and
investigate the pathomechanism of sterol depletion-induced dysmorphogenesis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Photosensitivity has been briefly mentioned in several publications
on the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome, an autosomal recessive mental
retardation syndrome. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to determine
the incidence and main features of photosensitivity in SLO. We confirmed a high
incidence, and initial evidence suggests that SLO may be the first example of
an inherited photosensitivity disorder in which sensitivity to UVA is common.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The cDNA encoding the 471-amino acid rat 7-dehydrocholesterol
reductase (DHCR), an enzyme that has been implicated in both cholesterol
biosynthesis and developmental abnormalities (e.g. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome)
in mammals, has been cloned and sequenced, and the primary structure of the
enzyme has been deduced. The DHCR gene was mapped to chromosome 8q2.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Rat DHCR, calculated molecular mass of
54.15-kDa polypeptide, shares a close amino acid identity with mouse and human
DHCRs (96 and 87%, respectively) as compared with its other related proteins
(e.g. fungal sterol Delta14-reductase) and exhibits high hydrophobicity
(&gt;68%) with 9 transmembrane domains. Five putative sterol-sensing domains
were predicted to be localized in transmembrane domains 4-8, which are highly
homologous to those found in 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol
regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein, and patched
protein. The polypeptide encoded by DHCR cDNA was expressed in yeast as a
55.45-kDa myc-tagged fusion protein, which was recognized with anti-myc
monoclonal antibody 9E10 and shown to possess full DHCR activity with respect
to dependence on NADPH and sensitivity to DHCR inhibitors. Northern blot
analysis indicates that the highest expression of DHCR mRNA was detected in
liver, followed by kidney and brain. In rat brains, the highest level of mRNA
encoding DHCR was detected in the midbrain, followed by the spinal cord and
medulla. Feeding rats 5% cholestyramine plus 0.1% lovastatin in chow resulted
in both approximately a 3-fold induction of DHCR mRNA and a 5-fold increase of
the enzymic activity in the liver. When rats were fed 0.1% (w/w) AY-9944 (in
chow) for 14-days, a complete inhibition of DHCR activity and a significant
reduction in serum total cholesterol level were observed. However, the level of
hepatic DHCR mRNA fell only slightly, suggesting that AY-9944 may act more
rapidly at the protein level than at the level of transcription of the DHCR
gene under these conditions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: To evaluate the consequences of altering retinal sterol
metabolism and composition on the development, histologic organization, and
electrophysiological function of the retina, under conditions that mimic the
biochemical hallmarks of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome. METHODS:
Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed cholesterol-free chow containing AY9944
(treated group), an inhibitor of 3beta-hydroxysterol delta7-reductase, from
gestational day 6 through postnatal day (P)28. Control animals were fed the
same chow, but without AY9944. In addition, progeny in the treated group were
injected subcutaneously every other day from birth to P28 with an olive oil
emulsion containing AY9944; control animals received olive oil emulsion alone.
At various postnatal times, tissues from treated and control animals were
harvested, and their sterol profiles were analyzed by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography. Companion eyes from animals of both
groups were examined histologically at P1. At P28, animals were evaluated by
electroretinography; tissues were then harvested for biochemical analysis and
companion eyes were subjected to histologic and ultrastructural analyses.
RESULTS: Treatment of developing rats with AY9944 caused markedly abnormal
accumulation of 7-dehydrosterols and severely reduced cholesterol levels in all
tissues examined, relative to control animals. Despite this, treated animals
exhibited normal retinal development and had no overt ocular defects or
decrease in electroretinographic function, up to P28. CONCLUSIONS: These
results were unexpected, given the known biophysical effects of such sterol
alterations on membrane properties and the profound dysmorphic and cognitive
abnormalities associated with genetic defects in 3beta-hydroxysterol
delta7-reductase that have been linked to the SLO syndrome. The results suggest
that 7-dehydrosterols can substitute functionally for cholesterol in the retina
or perhaps can act synergistically with subthreshold levels of residual
cholesterol to allow normal cellular structure and function to be achieved.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomic
recessive metabolic affection. Children affected by SLOS exhibit a defect in
cholesterol biosynthesis associated with a high concentration of cholesterol
precursor 7 dehydrocholesterol (7 DHC) and its isomers, which is due to an
enzymatic block at the level of delta-7-DHC reductase. SLOS has been subdivided
into two types on the basis of clinical severity: type I is the classic and
type II is the severe one. CASE REPORT: A full term female was born from a
pregnancy complicated by oligoamniosis and intra-uterine growth retardation.
The neurologic status was immediately impaired with severe hypotonia, absence
of reflexes, and abnormal crying. She exhibited multiple congenital anomalies
with a facial dysmorphia, anomalies of members, unicornus uterus and a pyloric
stenosis. Plasmatic concentration exhibited a normal cholesterolemia
contrasting with an elevated level of 7 and 8 DHC. Major alimentary tract
defect led to enteral and parenteral nutrition. The severe neurological defect
led to death on the 16th day of life. CONCLUSION: Despite normal blood
cholesterol levels that can be attributed to enteral and parenteral nutrition,
the severity of clinical findings and the lethal course permit to classify this
case as type II.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO) is a recognized clinical entity
with distinctive anomalies. Recently it has been shown that a specific defect
in cholesterol metabolism, 7-dehydroxycholesterol reductase deficiency, causes
the multiple abnormalities seen in SLO. There have been two reports of
first-trimester nuchal translucency associated with SLO. We report two cases of
SLO in the third trimester, one with persisting nuchal oedema and the other
presenting with hydrops. These findings may explain a proportion of the
perinatal loss associated with this syndrome.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We describe three unrelated patients with adrenal insufficiency and
RSH or Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a disorder due to deficient synthesis
of cholesterol. These patients presented with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and
decreased aldosterone-to-renin ratio, which is a sensitive measure of the
renin-aldosterone axis. All patients had profound serum total cholesterol
deficiency (14-31 mg/dl) and marked elevation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (10-45
mg/ dl). Two patients were newborn infants with 46, XY karyotypes and complete
failure to masculinize; one of these patients also had cortisol deficiency.
Both patients died within 10 days of birth of cardiopulmonary complications
while on adrenal replacement therapy. The third patient diagnosed with SLOS at
birth presented at age 7months with fever and diarrhea and was noted to have
profound hyponatremia. This patient is maintaining normal serum electrolytes on
mineralocorticoid replacement. We conclude that adrenal insufficiency may be a
previously undetected and treatable manifestation in SLOS. We hypothesize that
deficiency of cholesterol, an adrenal hormone precursor, may lead to
insufficient synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (RSH/SLOS) is a relatively
common, autosomal recessive malformation syndrome comprising distinctive
facial, limb and genital anomalies, and mental retardation. Most patients with
a clinical diagnosis of RSH/SLOS have a defect of cholesterol biosynthesis at
the level of 3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta7-reductase, resulting in a decreased
level of cholesterol and an increased level of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) in
body fluids and tissues. We report on our experience with the prenatal
diagnosis of RSH/SLOS by quantitative sterol chromatography in amniotic fluid
(AF) and chorionic villus (CV). Of 76 AF and nine CV samples analyzed for
various indications, 20 were diagnostic of RSH/SLOS based on an increased level
of 7DHC in the fluid or tissue. Of 39 fetuses at a 25% risk for RSH/SLOS,
10(25.6%) were affected. Twenty-nine pregnancies not known to be at risk for
RSH/SLOS were studied because of either a fetal abnormality characteristic of
RSH/SLOS detected by ultrasound, a low maternal serum uE3 level (MSuE3), or
both. None of the pregnancies tested, because of a low MSuE3 but lacking a
sonographic abnormality characteristic of RSH/SLOS, was affected. However,
three of four pregnancies with a low MSuE3 and an RSH/SLOS-type fetal
abnormality were positive. RSH/ SLOS was diagnosed in two additional
pregnancies on which MSuE3 data were not available but in which fetal anomalies
were identified. Of these five RSH/SLOS fetuses identified in pregnancies not
otherwise at risk for RSH/SLOS, the presenting sonographic anomaly was either
polydactyly, ambiguous genitalia, or both. Evaluation of the biochemical
parameters and clinical severity of RSH/SLOS showed that there was an inverse
correlation between clinical severity and both the level of AF 7DHC and the
level of MSuE3. Based on these earlier and more extensive studies, we conclude
that accurate prenatal diagnosis of RSH/ SLOS is possible by sterol analysis of
AF and, most likely, CV specimens as well. Furthermore, our findings suggest
that MSuE3 levels in combination with sonography may provide useful diagnostic
and prognostic information in the absence of a family history of RSH/SLOS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Opitz syndrome (OS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder
characterized by defects of the ventral midline, including hypertelorism, cleft
lip and palate, heart defects, and mental retardation. We recently identified
the gene responsible for X-linked OS. The ubiquitously expressed gene product,
MID1, is a member of the RING finger family. These proteins are characterized
by an N-terminal tripartite protein-protein interaction domain and a conserved
C terminus of unknown function. Unlike other RING finger proteins for which
diverse cellular functions have been proposed, the function of MID1 is as yet
undefined. By using the green fluorescent protein as a tag, we show here that
MID1 is a microtubule-associated protein that influences microtubule dynamics
in MID1-overexpressing cells. We confirm this observation by demonstrating a
colocalization of MID1 and tubulin in subcellular fractions and the association
of endogenous MID1 with microtubules after in vitro assembly. Furthermore,
overexpressed MID1 proteins harboring mutations described in OS patients lack
the capability to associate with microtubules, forming cytoplasmic clumps
instead. These data give an idea of the possible molecular pathomechanism
underlying the OS phenotype.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The term, "chondrodysplasia punctata" (CDP) denotes a pattern of
abnormal punctate calcification of dystrophic epiphyseal cartilage and certain
other cartilaginous structures, such as the larynx. CDP occurs in a variety of
genetic disorders associated with skeletal dwarfism and can also be caused by
prenatal exposure to warfarin. Although the most studied clinical syndrome with
CDP, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), is known to be caused by
several different abnormalities of plasmalogen biosynthesis, there are many
other genetic disorders with CDP for which the biochemical cause is unknown.
Because patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a primary disorder of sterol
biosynthesis, often have rhizomesomelic limb shortness and, less commonly, CDP,
we assessed sterol levels and metabolism in patients with different clinical
forms of CDP. By quantitative sterol analysis of a variety of tissues, we
identified 5 patients with similar radiological findings and abnormally
increased levels of 8-dehydrocholesterol and cholest-8(9)-en-3beta-ol,
suggesting a deficiency of 3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase, a
principal enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cultured cells available from one
patient showed increased levels of the same two sterols, decreased synthesis of
cholesterol, and a pattern of inhibition by triparanol and AY-9944 consistent
with a deficiency of 3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase. Clinical
diagnoses among the 5 patients included X-linked dominant
Conradi-Hunermann-Happle syndrome and nonspecific lethal CDP. We conclude that
abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis is a characteristic of some clinical
syndromes with rhizomesomelic dwarfing and CDP.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A cytogenetically normal male fetus was subsequently found to have
female external genitalia, a cardiac malformation and mid-trimester
intra-uterine growth retardation by ultrasound examination. The maternal serum
oestriol level was low. The combination of low oestriol and sonographic
findings suggested Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLO), which was confirmed by a
markedly increased amniotic fluid level of 7-dehydrocholesterol. We review the
differential diagnosis of apparent sex reversal in a fetus and low maternal
serum oestriol level. To further examine the specificity of low maternal
oestriol level as a marker for SLO a follow-up study of 12141 pregnancies
screened for Down syndrome using three biochemical markers: alpha-fetoprotein,
beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin and oestriol was performed. 26 pregnancies
had an oestriol level that was 0.25 MoM or less. SLO was not diagnosed
clinically in any of the liveborn children ascertained through a low maternal
oestriol level. Nine of the pregnancies ended in spontaneous miscarriage.
Although the frequency of SLO in pregnancies with low maternal oestriol levels
or sex-reversed fetuses is unknown, the diagnosis of SLO should, nevertheless,
be considered in both clinical settings.<p>

ABSTRACT:  7-Dehydrocholesterol accumulates in fetuses affected by the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome as a result of a deficit in the ultimate step of
cholesterol synthesis catalyzed by Delta7 reductase. Rat embryos explanted at
gestation day 10 and cultured for 48 h in the presence of the Delta7 reductase
inhibitor AY 9944 were used as a model to discriminate between the beneficial
effect of supplementation with cholesterol and the deleterious effect of
supplementation with 7-dehydrocholesterol. Cholesterol supplementation in the
form of mixed cholesterol/lecithin liposomes added to serum serving as the
culture medium restores the growth of embryos which is markedly decreased in
the presence of the inhibitor. 7-Dehydrocholesterol under identical conditions
does not restore growth and impairs the beneficial effect of cholesterol added
simultaneously. UV-photooxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol-supplemented culture
medium enhances its embryotoxicity, which suggests uptake by the embryo of
toxic by-products formed from 7-dehydrocholesterol. By contrast photooxidation
of cholesterol-supplemented culture medium does not induce embryotoxicity.
alpha-Tocopherol reduces the toxicity of photooxidized 7-dehydrocholesterol
supplementing the culture medium. We conclude that 7-dehydrocholesterol does
not fulfill the cholesterol requirement of the developing embryos and exerts an
additional embryotoxic effect probably via oxidized by-products. This could
explain the antenatal growth retardation of SLOS by a blockage of the maternal
compensatory cholesterol influx.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The equine-type estriols
1,3,5(10),7-estratetraene-3,16alpha,17beta-triol
(16alpha-hydroxy-17beta-dihydroequilin) and
1,3,5(10),6,8-estrapentaene-3,16alpha,17beta-triol
(16alpha-hydroxy-17beta-dihydroequilenin) constituted over half of the
estrogens excreted by a woman carrying a Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS)
affected fetus. The steroids were characterized by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC/MS), and mass spectra of the dehydro estriols as
trimethylsilyl ethers are illustrated. SLOS is associated with
7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC), delta 7-reductase deficiency; the enzyme
catalyzing the final step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Identification of these
equine estrogens show that an estrogen biosynthetic pathway parallel to normal
is functional in the feto-placental unit and uses 7DHC as precursor, therefore
P450scc, P450c17, and 3betaHSD and P450arom are all active on
7-dehydrometabolites. Patients with affected fetuses have low plasma estriol
values (probably due to deficient production of the cholesterol precursor) and
this is often a warning sign which instigates further evaluation for SLOS. The
estriol deficiency is not quantitatively made up by the dehydrometabolites, and
the combined excretion was found to be about one-third of the mean of
gestational age matched controls. The importance of these findings lies in the
potential value of dehydroestriol measurement for non-invasive diagnosis of
SLOS at mid-gestation. Currently diagnosis relies on imaging, since SLOS is a
malformation syndrome, and measurement of 7DHC levels in amniotic fluid and
chorionic villus tissue.<p>
