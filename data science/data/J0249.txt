<h1>Sebring International Raceway</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Sebring is one of the oldest constantly used tracks in the 
country, set on the unused runways and support roads for the 
airport. The first races were in the early 1950s with the famed 
12 Hours of Sebring sports car race. Currently, there are three 
track configurations; the 12 Hour Grand Prix Course, the Old Club 
Course, and the New Club Course. <p>
<p>
Sebring has their own web page at
<a href="http://www.sebringraceway.com/">http://www.sebringraceway.com/</a>.

<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">Historical Note</a></h2>
The track is the site of the 12 Hours of Sebring Grand Prix 
Endurance Race that began in the early 1950's. Many famed 
drivers have driven here; some gaining their fame here, some 
lending their fame to this circuit in its early years. While the 
12 Hours of Sebring is the most famous, this track is also the 
site of the very first Trans Am race, held as a support race 
before the 12 Hours in 1966. This 
track originally had a length of over 5 miles 
that incorporated many airport runways, which created many 
humorous stories of cars chasing airplanes and such at night. 
The course was later shortened to about 4.5 miles in 1986 and 
shortened again in 1990 to about 3.5 miles. The first time 
was to increase safety by putting distance between active 
runways and the cars and the second time to permit access 
to some warehouses so the track could operate throughout 
the year without having to close warehouse access. <p>

<h2><a name="TrackOffice">Track Office</a></h2>
<p>
The track is owned and operated by Sebring Airport Authority, Sebring, 
Florida. 
<br>
<br>
Timezone: Eastern Standard Time (-0400)

<p>
<h2><a name="GettingThere">Getting to Sebring International Raceway</a></h2>
Sebring is an easy track to find, with an airport beacon 
there to help you find it. It is set on the airport just 
east of Sebring, a small town in central Florida, south of 
Orlando, on highway US 27. <p>

<h3>From the North, Orlando, I4, and the rest of the world</h3>
You pass the lake on US 27 and will find a 
Checkers, McDonald's, and other fine eating establishments. 
Turn left at the traffic light by Checkers and proceed toward 
the center of town. At the second traffic light you will be 
by Winn Dixie, an old ice cream stand shaped like an ice cream 
cone, and the Kenilworth Hotel. Turn right and follow this 
roughly 5 miles until you come to the airport. It is quite 
obvious when you get there.<p>

<h3>From the South (Miami)</h3>
Take US 27 until you reach Hwy. 98. Go right 
(east) about 2 miles and watch for signs to the airport and 
the race track. Turn left and follow it past the animal 
shelter to the airport. Again, it becomes obvious.<p>

<h3>From the East (West Palm Beach)</h3>
Take Hwy. 98 through Spring Lake. Just past 
Spring Lake, you will see the airport in the distance to your 
right. A sign to the race track is next and you turn right. 
It is still quite obvious.<p>

<h2><a name="RacersGuide">A Racers' Guide to Sebring 
International Raceway</a></h2>
You pass through the huge gate used as the ticket booths for 
the 12 Hours of Sebring. On your right is a trailer set far 
back from the other buildings. This is registration. Go there 
first.<p>

NOTE:	Currently, the track is under construction 
	(June '95) for a change to the New Club 
	Course providing better access for the 
	industrial warehouse area of the 
	airport. This change affects the 
	configuration on the New Club Course turns 
	1 and 2 and maybe others. Also, the Main 
	Entrance is blocked and all entrants 
	must enter through the Will Call area. The 
	registration is currently being held in 
	the back of the Registration building, not 
	the IMSA Trailer.<p>

If you are running the 12 Hour course or the Old Club course, 
you will veer to the right and drive over the bridge. The guard 
will stop you first so have your credentials.<p>

If you are running the New Club course, keep going straight 
towards the blue hanger and make a left. You have to, the road 
turns. Angle back as you will drive either next to or over the 
drive over bridge. The guard will stop you first so have your 
credentials. <p>

<h3>Impound</h3>

Impound for the New Club Course is located in the tech area 
where the scales are, right behind the pits. As you exit the 
pits into the paddock at the end of a race, you are directed 
into impound.<p>

<h3>Tech</h3>

Tech for the New Club Course is located right behind the pits, 
east of the stewards' trailer.<p>

For the 12 Hour Grand Prix Course and the Old Club Course, the 
Tech and Scales are located near the Pit In entrance. You will 
pass it coming in over the bridge.<p>

<h3>False Grid</h3>

The False Grid for the New Club Course is on the roadway leading 
to the pit entrance and Turns 1 and 2 just west of the stewards' 
trailer.<p>

For the 12 Hour Grand Prix Course and the Old Club Course, the 
False Grid is located in the East end of the Paddock near Pit Out. 
Occasionally, it is near the Scales, so check your Supps.<p>

<h3>Timing and Scoring</h3>

Timing and Scoring for the New Club Course is located in the 
trailer right behind the start finish line between the Hairpin 
and turn 1.<p>

For the 12 Hour Grand Prix Course and the Old Club Course, the 
Timing and Scoring is located near the driveover bridge.<p>

<h3>Stewards' Trailer</h3>

Hopefully, you won't have to go here, but the Stewards' Trailer 
for the New Club Course is near the entrance to the pits, next 
to the false grid. The drivers meetings are held here.<p>

For the 12 Hour Grand Prix Course and the Old Club Course, the 
Stewards are located in the tower in the center of the garages.<p>

<h3>Sound Control</h3>

Sound Control for the New Club Course takes its readings from the 
inside of the track just past the Timing and Scoring Trailer.<p>

<h3>Driving the Course</h3>

I don't call this a hot lap, since so many famous drivers have 
driven at Sebring, I can't pretend to be the expert. However, 
they have elected not to write, and I did, so I'll tell you how 
to find your way around without looking too bad. <p>

The New Club Course and Grand Prix Course corners correspond like this:<p>
NCC   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11 <p>
12Hr  7   8   9   10  11  12  13  3   4   5   6 <p>

<h3>The 12 Hour Grand Prix Course (3.5 miles)</h3>

The Grand Prix course uses both the old club course and the 
new club course. <p>

Leaving the pits, stay to drivers' right. Turn 1 is to the left 
and the apex is much later than most imagine and they typically 
spin, going backwards into the outer wall. Turn 2 is a slight bend 
back to the right, where you leave runway concrete and enter 
racetrack pavement. A short shot up to Turn 3, a 90 degree left, 
where you enter the area commonly known as the New Club Course, 
by NCC turn 8. <p>

There is a lazy bend to the right and starts what is a 
carousel-type turn. Turn 4 is the flag station halfway through 
and at the exit. This is a fast corner, around 60 to 75 mph. 
It is flat and marbles are everywhere but on the line. 
Typically, most drivers apex turn 4 too early and run 
off the exit into the grass. 
Many will spin due to the speed trying to 
apex this late and trying to pull it back in. Watch out as 
this is a favorite place for cars to be erratic and cross 
the track several times attempting to regain control. More 
than one innocent driver has T-boned or been T-boned at this 
corner.<p>

If bunched up, stay drivers' left in turn 4. You can hold the 
line better and the outside car may run off the track. It also 
prevents having the inside car hit you in the side. This also 
gives you a chance to apex the right hand bend turn 5, the 
uprights of the drive over bridge, and have lots of speed 
going into Big Bend, a very fast right hand sweeper. This is 
a fast section of the course. You will be flat out, easily 
160 mph if you can go that fast, and having a lot of side 
loads due to the corner. <p>

Depending on your braking points, you will want to be drivers' 
left under the walkover bridge approaching the Hairpin and 
begin braking after the bridge, near the left hand flag station. 
You should be around 160 or so here and you will drop to around 
30 or less in the Hairpin. Be sure your brakes work. The escape 
road goes off to the left, but it requires scrubbing speed 
before you use it. <p>
The Hairpin bends back more than 90 degrees to the right so 
brake as much as possible before turning. Some Formula cars 
almost come to a stop on the left side before turning sharply 
while most Production based cars tend to trail brake some while 
turning less sharply at the end. Be sure to keep an eye on your 
right side as more than one driver attempts to pass inside and 
T-bones the others because his brakes won't hold. <p>

Tracking out to the left, you need as much room as possible under 
power. Turns 7 and 8 form a right then left esse turn. While drivers' 
left is the fastest line through turns 7 and 8, drivers' 
right is more easily defended and a better place to pass, 
setting you up for turn 9. A pass started in turn 7 may take 
until turn 9 to complete. You should cut speed more for turn 1 
than you can take it, as it is surprisingly fast, so that you 
can continue speed through turn 8. The section of track between 
1 and 2 is crowned some, with old seams between old airport 
concrete runways and newer track surfaces, and can upset your 
suspension. Don't be alarmed, just understand.<p>

Again, stay left for the speed through turn 9 or right to 
defend/attack through 9. Turn 9 is a sharp 90 degree right 
turn which you enter with lots of speed and exit to turn 10, 
a left sweeping turn that kicks back in a slight break to 
right at turn 11. Some prefer to track out 
of turn 9 to the left and return right to apex on the left 
in turn 10, tracking back out to the right in turn 11. Others 
find it faster to just stay left after turn 3 and track out 
going into turn 11. Most have to upshift in the middle of 
turn 10 due to the speed.<p>

There is a very short straight from turn 11 to turn 12. You will 
be approaching turn 12, a 90 degree right turn, very fast, in 
third gear. The trackout area has an FIA curbing that many 
use to help hold them on the track. Unfortunately, many also 
hook a tire on this and jump abruptly back in front of you. 
Beware. Again, the drivers' right inside line is strategically 
better for passing and defending. <p>

This is some of the last race track surface as you head back to 
airport runways. Turn 13 is a flag station about where the New 
Club Course turn 7 is, and is merely a flag station, as the track 
is still straight. turn 14 is a bend to the left, with the inside 
boundary marked with pylons. these get in the way of a truly fast 
line and someone will eventually take them out. Observe this area 
carefully in daylight hours as there are a few small holes you need 
to locate before cutting out across runways.<p>

Turn 15 is the bend to the right, with a barrier wall on the right 
and open runway on the left, marked with pylons. These pylons have 
a habit of finding their way onto the track.<p>

Depending on whether you are running the Club 12 Hour course or the 
March 12 Hours of Sebring Grand Prix course, the right side may be 
marked with pylons or it may have the barrier walls up to provide 
added paddock room. If pylons, these also have a habit of finding 
their way both onto the track and to parts unknown, as drivers 
"widen" the track. Naturally, they do not do this with concrete 
barrier walls. At least not successfully. the outside is still 
marked with pylons but as the hours go by, they disappear. Unlike 
an autocross, no one runs out to reset them. <p>

As you exit the bend, turn 16 flag station is on your right. There 
is a very wide and fast straight to turn 17, a blind right had turn 
under the drive over bridge. When it rains hard, this area floods, 
especially under the bridge. Also, since the straight is so long, 
more than one car has overcooked brakes and crashed into the 
outside wall. It is more typical to hit the left wall under the 
bridge. Turn 17 is another late apex turn which most do not figure 
out until too late. Stay much farther left approaching turn 17 and 
apex late and you will have a better time. Watch for those who come 
up the right side as they will no doubt visit the left wall. Turn 
18 is right at Pit In. You want to apex this also late and your 
trackout point should be right next to the left wall just past 
the walkover bridge supports. Due to the walls from turn 16 to 
turn 1, sometimes cars can park themselves in the wall and not 
be visible. Watch the flags and believe them. <p>

<h3>The Old Club Course</h3>

The Old Club Course is the section of the Grand Prix course 
on the old runways and surrounding the Grand Prix pits and 
paddock. Much of the surface is old runway concrete and is 
hard on tires.<p>

<h3>The New Club Course (Johnson Course)(1.7 miles)</h3>

The New Club Course is the section of the Grand Prix course 
that surrounds the Green Park area, named for the green grassy 
areas inside.<p>

The false grid is a section of roadway that exits at the 
beginning of the pits between turns 1 and 2. All practice 
and race sessions start from here. The stewards trailer is 
on your right and a couple of shade trees on your left. You 
need to find the false grid before you do a lap.<p>

Sometimes you will enter the track at turn 2 and sometimes you 
will go through the pits to turn 5. Either way doesn't matter. 
We will begin our lap at the Start line. You will follow the 
pack or the pace car around the track to Big Bend and down 
towards the Hairpin. If the pace car is out, it will pull off 
to drivers' left down the escape road. Take a good look at 
this, as if you need to use this escape road, you must plan in 
advance for it. You can't hit your brakes and find out you 
have none and then decide to take the escape road. You must scrub 
some speed first and apex it from the right side of the track. 
You may still hit the guardrail at the end but it is far 
better than hitting the embankment on the other side of the 
Hairpin.<p>

For the start, you want to be as far left as possible going 
into the Hairpin, so you can get straight as possible going 
through the Hairpin. The Start/Finish is halfway between the 
Hairpin and turn 1 next to the Timing and Scoring trailer. 
Turns 1 and 2 form a right then left esse turn. While drivers' 
left is the fastest line through turns 1 and 2, drivers' 
right is more easily defended and a better place to pass, 
setting you up for turn 3. A pass started in turn 1 may take 
until turn 3 to complete. You should cut speed more for turn 1 
than you can take it, as it is surprisingly fast, so that you 
can continue speed through turn 2. The section of track between 
1 and 2 is crowned some, with old seams between old airport 
concrete runways and newer track surfaces, and can upset your 
suspension. Don't be alarmed, just understand.<p>

Again, stay left for the speed through turn 3 or right to 
defend/attack through 3. Turn 3 is a sharp 90 degree right 
turn which you enter with lots of speed and exit to turn 4, 
a left sweeping turn that kicks back in a slight break to 
right at turn 5. Turn 5 is also the exit of the pits so watch 
for cars entering the track here. Some prefer to track out 
of turn 3 to the left and return right to apex on the left 
in turn 4, tracking back out to the right in turn 5. Others 
find it faster to just stay left after turn 3 and track out 
going into turn 5. Most have to upshift in the middle of 
turn 4 due to the speed.<p>

There is a very short straight from turn 5 to turn 6. You will 
be approaching turn 6, a 90 degree right turn, very fast, in 
third gear. The trackout area has an FIA curbing that many 
use to help hold them on the track. Unfortunately, many also 
hook a tire on this and jump abruptly back in front of you. 
Beware. Again, the drivers' right inside line is strategically 
better for passing and defending. <p>

A short straight connects turn 6 with turn 7, another 90 degree 
right turn. This straight is wider than the exit of turn 7 so 
expect a bunching of cars here. This makes turn 7 a second 
gear turn as you need to slow more going in and you need to 
get a good launch out. The fastest line is starting from 
drivers' left again, but it is poor defense as drivers' right 
will get inside you and be in the better position for turns 8 
and 9. With luck and practice, though, being left can work 
better for you.<p>

Turn 8 is a lazy bend to the right and starts what is a 
carousel-type turn. Turn 9 is the flag station halfway through 
and at the exit. This is a fast corner, around 60 to 75 mph. 
It is flat and marbles are everywhere but on the line. To do 
this well, you want to sacrifice turn 8 by setting an apex 
point in the centerline of the track preceding turn 8 so as 
to get to the right side of the track and late apex turn 9, 
using the entire corner. Typically, most drivers apex turn 8 
late and turn 9 too early and run off the exit into the grass. 
The speed that you are going means many will spin trying to 
apex this late and trying to pull it back in. Watch out as 
this is a favorite place for cars to be erratic and cross 
the track several times attempting to regain control. More 
than one innocent driver has T-boned or been T-boned at this 
corner.<p>

If bunched up, stay drivers' left in turn 9. You can hold the 
line better and the outside car may run off the track. It also 
prevents having the inside car hit you in the side. This also 
gives you a chance to apex the right hand bend turn 10, the 
uprights of the drive over bridge, and have lots of speed 
going into Big Bend, a very fast right hand sweeper. This is 
the fast section of the course. You will be flat out, easily 
160 mph if you can go that fast, and having a lot of side 
loads due to the corner. <p>

Depending on your braking points, you will want to be drivers' 
left under the walkover bridge approaching the Hairpin and 
begin braking after the bridge, near the left hand flag station. 
You should be around 160 or so here and you will drop to around 
30 or less in the Hairpin. Be sure your brakes work. The Hairpin 
bends back more than 90 degrees to the right so you want to 
brake as much as possible before turning. Some Formula cars 
almost come to a stop on the left side before turning sharply 
while most Production based cars tend to trail brake some while 
turning less sharply at the end. Be sure to keep an eye on your 
right side as more than one driver attempts to pass inside and 
T-bones the others because his brakes won't hold. <p>

Tracking out to the left, you need as much room as possible under 
power. It is virtually a drag race from the Hairpin to the Finish 
line.<p>


<h3>In the Rain</h3>

Most of the track has good drainage and can be driven on the line 
in the rain. Turn 9 should be off the line, as the line is slick 
and the rest has enough sand to provide some traction in the rain.<p>

Going past turn 10 through Big Bend, stay drivers' right as it 
gives you extra room to catch yourself if you slip and lets the 
others drive on the slick line. Stay drivers' right into the 
Hairpin, breaking back about the walkover bridge, and keep to 
the inside. The regular line can be very slick and at least one 
car each lap will slide through the Hairpin attempting to pass 
on the inside. You don't want to be sideways turning from the 
left when he does.<p>
