      <P>The Java Grande conference was established with the purpose of 
      championing Java technology for scientific applications and 
      high-performance network computing systems. This article covers the goals 
      of this special forum, as gleaned from an interview with Geoffrey Fox, the 
      academic coordinator for Java Grande. 
      <P>The 1999 Java Grande Conference, the fourth in a series of meetings 
      "exploring the use of the Java programming language for scientific and 
      engineering computing and high-performance network computing," was held in 
      early June, the weekend before the 1999 JavaOne<FONT 
      size=-2><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> conference in San Francisco. The Java Grande 
      forum was established to promote Java's use in scientific applications and 
      high-performance network computing systems. In choosing a name for the 
      forum, members were careful not to choose a name that implied 
      supercomputing or science exclusively, because they didn't want to put off 
      members of the wider Java programming developer community. Java Grande 
      Academic Coordinator Geoffrey Fox explains that the name was chosen 
      because "it is meant to signify Java on the high-end scientific side, as 
      opposed to the embedded side." 
      <P>These days, high schools and colleges are using the Java programming 
      language as an introductory programming language. Fox said that all the 
      way back in 1996, he looked down the road and realized that soon the best 
      young minds would no longer be interested in programming in Fortran and 
      C++; he was convinced that eventually those two languages "wouldn't cut 
      it" for high-end scientific apps. He felt that the only option was to 
      convince the scientific community that Java technology could meet its 
      needs. 
      <P>When he tried to interest colleagues in moving their efforts to the 
      Java platform, he was told that it was not appropriate for scientific use. 
      Fox, who is also the director of the Northeast Parallel Architectures 
      Center and a professor of physics and computer science at Syracuse 
      University, admits that, at that early stage of the language's 
      development, he had to agree with his colleagues' concerns about Java's 
      performance. He pressed on, however, because he considered the goal of 
      "convincing his colleagues to move to Java technology [to be] a matter of 
      national security and economic wealth, given the limitations of 
      programming in the older languages." 
      <P>Fox began organizing meetings and conferences in 1996 and initially 
      found little support. In the few years since, his efforts have begun to 
      attract attention from those developers interested in high-end 
      computing—and have piqued the interest of Sun Microsystems as well. James 
      Gosling delivered the keynote address at last year's Java Grande meeting. 
      This year, Bill Joy delivered the keynote, and both Gosling and Sun's John 
      Gage attended the conference. Based on the success of this year's meeting, 
      which was endorsed by the Association for Computing Machinery, the Java 
      Grande organizers plan to hold their meeting immediately before the 
      JavaOne conference every year from now on. 
      <H4>Java Grande's Working Groups</H4>As it stands now, according to Fox, 
      the Java Grande meeting group has two fundamental roles: 
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It works with Sun 
        to make "modest changes in the Java programming language to support 
        scientific computing."</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The members 
        explain to the high-end computing community how to use Java technology 
        and the Grande framework—and why they should want to do so. 
      </FONT></LI></UL>Currently, the forum is divided into a numerics working 
      group and a concurrency working group. The forum, though, "is open to any 
      qualified member of academia, industry, or government who is willing to 
      play an active role." 
      <P>The numerics group has found Sun to be very receptive to its ideas. 
      Siamak Hassanzadeh, Sun's liaison to Java Grande, explains that, from 
      Sun's perspective, the Java Grande forum serves as a model of an expert 
      group. In a way, Java Grande has served as a prototype for the Java 
      Community Process (JCP). The numerics group is currently preparing to 
      submit seven Java Specification Requests to the JCP by the end of July. 
      <H4>The Work of the Numerics Group</H4>One of the challenges for the forum 
      is that the problems its members encounter in developing nonstandard Java 
      applications have many possible solutions, and each one involves a 
      compromise. These problems can have broad implications. For example, there 
      has been much discussion around the problem of how best to implement 
      complex numbers in the Java programming language. According to 
      Hassanzadeh, the team working on the Java 3D<FONT 
      size=-2><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> API at Sun is interested in Java Grande's 
      work in this area, as some of the team's algorithms could benefit from an 
      improvement in this complex-numbers implementation. 
      <P>One option is to add complex objects to Java programs, but this results 
      in decreased performance. Other options include adding a primitive type, 
      or making compilers more clever. Another debate that surfaces in 
      implementing complex numbers involves operator overload. The Java Grande 
      forum supports operator overload, so that <CODE>a + b</CODE> means 
      addition whether the two variables are integers or complex numbers. Fox 
      says that, if the high-end computing community is to commit to this 
      programming language, "Java has to first be reasonable," in the same way 
      that doctors pledge to first "do no harm." 
      <P>At the Wednesday morning keynote address during JavaOne, Bill Joy made 
      a point that is of particular interest to the high-end computing 
      community: there are alternatives to insisting that calculations should 
      have reproducible results across machines. For example, the Java 
      implementation of a sine function currently returns the same value on any 
      platform. Fox notes that "the disadvantages of this in the [high-end 
      computing] community are sufficiently high" to encourage alternatives that 
      might improve performance. There is agreement that Java's default behavior 
      should retain reproducible results across machines, but that there should 
      also be a second option that calls optimized routines for the numerical 
      community. 
      <P>The implementation of this change has not yet been agreed upon. Joy has 
      suggested introducing a new keyword called <CODE>fast</CODE>, which, when 
      included in a class, indicates that your compiler should use traditional 
      methods. The point would be to establish performance options that enable 
      the high-end computing community to buy into the idea of programming in 
      the Java technology. The current debate is whether there should be two 
      levels of performance options or three. Other issues being discussed by 
      the numerics group include those centered around the actual implementation 
      of various algorithms, interval arithmetic, and the huge amount of 
      overhead that currently comes with multidimensional arrays. 
      <H4>Concurrency Working Group Activities </H4>Another area of interest to 
      the high-end computing community is large-scale distributed and parallel 
      computing. Gains in some of these concurrency areas have been made using 
      Web-based collaboration, enabling many modestly-sized machines to work on 
      the same problem. Jini<FONT size=-2><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> and 
      JavaSpaces<FONT size=-2><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> can help with these problems 
      if synchronization is not an issue. These so-called <EM>pleasingly 
      parallel</EM> systems are set up so that, if a process breaks, it notifies 
      other systems of the problem so that another agent can perform the task at 
      another time. 
      <P>High-end computing applications cannot accommodate the looseness of 
      these asynchronous systems. As Fox points out, if you're doing a realtime 
      fluid dynamics simulation and the component doing calculations for a wing 
      breaks, you can't just get back to it at some vague time in the future. 
      "In an immersive simulation you need all computers working at the same 
      time. You need to synchronize," Fox says. The work of the concurrency 
      group is of interest to a broader community as well, just as that of the 
      numerics group is. For example, improved distributed and parallel 
      computing will help weather forecasters. Bill Joy would like to see Java 
      technology used to simulate the physical world. This work could help that 
      effort, as well as research being done in fields such as cosmology and 
      petroleum engineering. 
      <P>The Java Grande forum is contemplating the idea that Enterprise 
      JavaBeans<FONT size=TM><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (EJBs) may be the right things 
      for the high-end computing community. Fox feels that the architecture of 
      RMI is adequate, and wonders whether the forum can develop Enterprise 
      Grande Beans based on EJBs. The forum is also looking at the 
      message-passing interface (MPI), and believes there needs to be a new MPI 
      model for parallel computing. 
      <H4>Future Plans for the Forum </H4>The members of the Java Grande forum 
      do not intend that it become a standards body for the Java programming 
      language. So, for example, although many of its members would like to see 
      parametrized types become a part of the language, the forum has no working 
      group considering the issue. On the other hand, although no group is 
      working on the idea of attaching dimensions to numbers (three meters, 
      three feet, three seconds, and so on), Fox and Hassanzadeh recognize that 
      this might be an appropriate subject for the Java Grande forum to consider 
      in the future.
