The following is the first anouncement.

We plan to bring together a small number (10--15) of outstanding
scientists working in the field of galaxies and galaxy clusters.  The
workshop will be informal, with short talks in the morning and
afternoons free for discussions and joint work between the
participants and members of the host institution (Osservatorio
Astronomico di Brera).  Our main goal will be to better understand the
evolutionary processes that affect galaxies in the cluster environment
at different redshifts.  Participants will come from different
backgrounds (theorists and observers, local and high z Universe) and a
significant fraction of them are members of the TMR Network. The
workshop will be a great opportunity to continue existing
collaborations and possibly start new ones. The number of participants
and available funds is limited, however, if anyone is interested,
feel free to contact one of the organizers:<p>
