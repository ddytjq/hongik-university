<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> How many entries do you receive each
year?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> By tradition, we do not say.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> How many judging rounds do you have?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Are you trying to trick us? We will not say
that either.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> I cannot get entry xyzzy from year 19xx to compile!
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Some winners, particularly winners from long
ago, no longer compile on more modern systems because the C language has
evolved (i.e. the modern C compilers are much more strict in what they
accept as a valid program), or the entry depended on operation system
and library features that where common back then but are different/missing
today.
<BR>E.g. it is highly unlikely that you'll be able to execute <A HREF="years.html#1984/mullender">1984/mullender</A> on a computer you're using to read this FAQ.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> I found a bug in a previous winner, what should
I do?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> We do not ``maintain'' the contest winners.
The code is made available on an ``AS IS'' basis. If you have a FIX for
a entry, we suggest that you try and EMail it to the authors and to CC:
<A HREF="mailto:questions@ioccc.org">questions@ioccc.org</A>.
Be sure that words 'ioccc question' appear somewhere in your subject
line.
<BR>IF you have a FIX, and IF the author does not object, and IF your fix
looks reasonable, we will add a web link to a copy of your EMail message
for others to see.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> Are there types of entries that are submitted
so frequently that the judges get tired of them?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Yes, there are types of entries that show up
over and over again.
<BR>The <A HREF="guidelines.html">guidelines</A> say:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>We tend to dislike programs that:</I>

<P>HINT: It is not fatal to send in those types of entries, it is just MUCH
HARDER to win. Such an entry would have to do something really unique and
interesting to even make it into the final judging rounds. Entries that
re-use these 'worn out' themes frequently lose to other entries that do
something different.
<P>HINT: If you really MUST send in an entry based on an 'over-used theme',
be sure that it is obfuscated in several new and novel ways. Be sure to clearly
explain near the beginning of your remarks why you are submitting a entry
based on an 'over-used theme' and why the judges should not simply toss
it out as being boring.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> What should I write in the 'remark' section
of my entry, if anything at all?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> As much or as little as you wish.
<P>What helps:
<UL>
<LI>
explaining what your entry does</LI>

<LI>
how to entice it to do what it is suppoosed to do</LI>

<LI>
what obfuscations are used</LI>

<LI>
what are the limitations of your entry in respect of portability and/or input
data</LI>

<LI>
how it works (if you are really condescending)</LI>
</UL>
<P>What does not help:
<UL>
<LI>
admitting that your entry is not very obfuscated (you see, the contest
is called <B>IOCCC</B>, not <B>INVOCCC</B>); but even if you do not admit it,
not very obfuscated entries have a minuscule chance to win
(although <A HREF="years.html#2000_tomx">2000/tomx</A> is a notable counterexample)</LI>

<LI>
mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark section
(or in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased during the
judging rounds; we look at the author name only if an entry wins</LI>

<LI>
leaving the remark section empty</LI>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> I am confused: what should I put to the 'build'
section?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> The 'build' section must contain UNIX shell-style
commands to compile your C language entry <B>in a file named prog.c</B>
and produce an executable file. More than one command is allowed,
as far as the size rule is followed.
Usually one (or more) of these commands will be an invocation of
a C compiler (use <B>cc</B> or <B>gcc</B>), but there may be exceptions
(or not anymore, see <A HREF="years.html#2000_tomx">2000/tomx</A>).
<BR>If your entry depends on a particular source file name during
compilation or execution, you will have to put a line
<PRE>cp prog.c desired_name.c</PRE> before the compiler invocation line.
<BR>If in doubt, put
<PRE>cc -o prog prog.c</PRE> in the 'build' section.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> What happened to the winners for 1997 and 1999?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> There are none. There was no IOCCC in those
years.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> Why don't you publish non-winners?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Because the publication on the IOCCC site <B><I>IS</I></B>
the award! Anyone is free to put their IOCCC hopefuls, lookalikes and/or
non-winners on their web page for everyone to see.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> How much time does it take to judge the contest?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> It takes a fair amount of time to setup, run,
answer EMail, process (note that we do not contact the author if an entry
does not compile or does not work as advertised, we might attempt to fix
obvious compilation problems or incompatibilities, but no more than that
- so be sure that your entry does work on at least a couple different platforms,
at least one of them being UNIX or POSIX-conforming) entries, review entries,
trim down the set entries to a set of winners, doing the write-up of the
winners, announcing the winners, reviewing final edits of the winning entry
set, posting the winners, being flamed :-), tell folks who send in late
entries to wait until the next contest, etc... It takes a few weekends
and a number nights of study and work ... which is hard given that we are busy
with many other activities as well.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> What platform should I assume for my entry?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Your entry must compile with GCC and run under
at least one flavor of UNIX (e.g. Linux or Solaris). To improve chances
to win, it should work under both BSD and SysV style UNIX (think <B>stty
cbreak</B>), and should not depend on endianness. If it can compile and
run on Windows and/or Mac  (see <A HREF="years.html#2000_thadgavin">2000/thadgavin</A>),
even better.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> I would like to mirror the IOCCC web site. May
I do so?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Please see: <A HREF="mirror_request.html">http://www.ioccc.org/mirror_request.html</A>
for more information.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> I want to publish some parts of the IOCCC in
an article, or book, or newsletter, or use then in class/instructional
notes, or quote from the IOCCC. May I do so?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> Please ask the IOCCC judges first. Please send
your request to: <A HREF="mailto:questions@ioccc.org">questions@ioccc.org</A>
Be sure to that words 'ioccc question' appear somewhere in your subject
line.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> What are the grand prize / Best of Show winners?
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> In 1984-1987, the grand prize winners are:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1984_mullender">1984/mullender</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1985_shapiro">1985/shapiro</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1986_wall">1986/wall</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1987_lievaart">1987/lievaart</A></LI>
</UL>
<BR>Starting from 1988, the entry we liked the most in that year is called
"Best of Show". Here are the "Best of Show" entries:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1988_applin">1988/applin</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1989_jar.2">1989/jar.2</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1990_theorem">1990/theorem</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1991_brnstnd">1991/brnstnd</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1992_vern">1992/vern</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1996_august">1996/august</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1998_banks">1998/banks</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#2000_jarijyrki">2000/jarijyrki</A></LI>
</UL>
<BR>In 1993, 1994 and 1995 the judges were unable to select a clear overall
winner. So to give a nod to the entry that had the highest approval ranking
from the judges, they used the following awards:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1993_rince">1993/rince</A> - Most Well Rounded</LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1994_shapiro">1994/shapiro</A> - Most Well Rounded</LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="years.html#1995_leo">1995/leo</A> - Best Use of Obfuscation</LI>
</UL>
These could be considered the 'better entry' for those years with 1 or
more other entries that came in close behind.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Q:</FONT> I managed to get entry xyzzy from year 19xx to compile; now it fails to run!
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT> switch(19xx/xyzzy) { <UL>

instead.<BR>Enable reverse wraparound in your xterm window for best results.
