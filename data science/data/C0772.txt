<b>Quality of Cover</b><p>

<b>We have an excellent reputation for getting the job done right, and have always prided ourselves on providing our customers with:<p>

<ul>
<li> An ability to properly assess a customer's needs and provide the right policy to suit his/her requirements.
Although price is highly important, we do not sell on this alone, but instead, will assess a customer's requirements and tailor a policy  to suit their individual needs.</li><p>

<li>  Comprehensive policies with extensive policy wordings.
The fewer restrictions and exceptions to cover there are within an insurance policy, the easier it is for a customer to make a claim against an insurance company. </li> <p>


<li>  A general policy of only dealing with insurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates who provide excellent service to our customers.
We have very strict service standards and we expect them to be followed by any insurance company with which we trade. Our claims handling ability is one of the most important factors of our job. You can rely on us when the unforeseen happens. </li><p>

<li> Last, but certainly not least, is price.
Through our negotiating skills we have developed a wide range of policies that are exceptionally competitively priced. We are therefore confident that our policies represent superb value for money, combining wide cover with an excellent service and competitive prices.<p>
In fact with our household insurance cover we  guarantee that you won't find cheaper comparable insurance.
