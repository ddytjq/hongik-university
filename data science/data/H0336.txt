                The management, partnerships, and implementation plan for the Natural and
                Accelerated Bioremediation Research Program is described in this section.  The
                description includes the DOE oversight and management structure; the management
                approach for the program; partnerships to identify needed research and disseminate
                information; research to address ethical, legal, and social impacts; procedures for
                selecting the field sites; the formation of the scientific team; and peer
                review.<p>
                <h3>DOE OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE</H3>
                
<HR>
The management structure for the program is presented in Figs. 7 and 8.  Figure 7
shows the direct management of the program by OHER.  DOE management will include
fiscal oversight of the science team, field research centers, and the R&D shared
infrastructure.  The program will be supported by an interagency steering committee
to ensure coordination with complementary programs and to identify opportunities
for leveraging scientific and infrastructure investments.<P>
Figure 8 illustrates the internal structure of the program.  The DOE management
will be supported by a program office that will manage the program on a day-to-day
basis.  The program office will be responsible for scientific coordination within
and among program elements, scheduling of major activities at the test sites,
communication and database management, and facilitating access to the R&D shared
infrastructure.  Final management approval and oversight will be retained by
OHER.<p>

                            <hr><i><h4>Each program element will have a scientific team leader who is
                responsible for scientific direction and coordination within the program element,
                as well as facilitating collaboration with other program elements.</h4></i><hr>
                An executive committee will be responsible for coordinating the scientific program,
                making recommendations for the locations of the field research centers, and
                identifying the highest priority needs for R&D shared infrastructure.  The
                executive committee will consist of the program office manager, team leaders for
                each of the program elements, field research center managers, and managers of major
                instrumentation facilities.<P>
                The science team will be responsible for setting the scientific direction of the
                program and for carrying out research activities.  The scientific team will consist
                of DOE laboratory scientists, academic researchers, industry researchers,
                postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and technicians.  Each program element
                will have a scientific team leader who is responsible for scientific direction and
                coordination within the program element.  The team leaders will also be responsible
                for identifying opportunities and facilitating collaboration with other program
                elements.  The team leader for each program element will be a member of the
                executive committee.<P>
                Each field research center will have an on-site manager who will be responsible for
                obtaining permits, developing and implementing a site safety plan, day-to-day
                scheduling of field activities, and site operations.  The field research center
                managers will supervise a staff of technicians and other support personnel at the
                site.  The manager of each field research center will be a member of the executive
                committee.<P>
                Managers will also be identified for major laboratory measurement facilities. 
                These managers will be responsible for facilitating use of the instruments by a
                variety of scientific investigators, day-to-day scheduling of activities,
                developing and implementing a site safety plan, and instrument operation.  The
                manager of each major instrument facility will be a member of the executive
                committee.<P>
                The activities described above will be funded by OHER.  The scientific program will
                be funded primarily by competitive proposals, regardless of the status of the
                principal investigator -- academic, federal laboratories, or industry.  The program
                will seek the best talent available to address the goals identified in the program
                elements.  Managers and staff for field research centers and major instrumentation
                facilities will be located primarily at the DOE laboratories.<P>
                <h3>PARTNERSHIPS AND EDUCATION TO ENABLE IMPLEMENTATION</H3>
                
<HR>
Too often, scientific development, research, engineering implementation, and social
acceptance are poorly synchronized.  The focus of scientific research sometimes
does not reflect engineering and societal needs and thus contributes little to the
mainstream of higher education and/or the solution of immediate and important
problems.  At other times, scientific knowledge that could contribute
to solutions is overlooked because of poor communication between problem
holders, the scientific community, regulatory agencies, and the public. 
The intent of the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research
Program is to overcome these barriers by establishing proactive
partnerships and educational vehicles to enable implementation of the
scientific knowledge gained over the ten-year effort.<P>
<HR><H4><i>Transfer of the scientific knowledge gained will be the key
to the success of this program.</i></h4><hr>
To achieve the goal of a seamlessly integrated research program in which
new knowledge is implemented quickly and effectively as well as used for
training scientists and engineers of the future, this program is
committed to providing sustained support for two types of activities:<P>
<i>1. Linkage with the EM problem holders.</i><P>
Identifying those problems that are most important to solve is the
critical key to funding meaningful research.  Systematic methods of
working with DOE's Environmental Management (EM) program will be
established -- including ongoing interaction with Headquarters staff,
field offices, and site problem-holders -- to identify high-priority
problems that may be solved through bioremediation.  EM staff will
participate in programmatic peer reviews and act as advisors to the
program.  At least one person from EM will be requested to serve as a
liaison between this program and the prime focus area.  This person will
bridge the gap between NABIR's fundamental research and EM's technology
development programs.<P>
The program will seek input on directions and priorities from within
OHER, from other divisions of DOE, and from other government agencies
and bioremediation programs.  Program managers performing related
research in OHER and DOE's Basic Energy Sciences Program will be asked
to act as advisors to the program.  Communication will be established
and maintained with other federal, state, and private bioremediation
research programs to coordinate complementary programs and avoid
unnecessary duplication.  Managers of related programs will be invited
to serve as advisors.<P>
Transfer of the scientific knowledge gained will also be a key to the
success of this program.  Through peer review and open meetings with the
scientific community, results of the program will be communicated and
the most promising avenues of research will be identified on an ongoing
basis.  The field research centers can play a major role in transferring
scientific knowledge to the problem holders and students alike. 
Opportunities for other programs and universities to use the sites will
help accomplish this goal, and short courses and summer stipend support
for higher education will be provided throughout the DOE complex and
through scientific societies and other appropriate venues.<P>
<i>2. Information and education outreach programs. </i><p>
Implementing technologies based on new scientific knowledge requires effective
communication with problem holders, regulatory agencies, and the public.  The
program will establish and maintain an effective information outreach and education
program to accomplish this objective.  Several different methods of disseminating
information will be used: the World Wide Web to publish program opportunities and
accomplishments, a newsletter aimed at DOE sites and regulatory agencies, a
curriculum program for higher education, and timely publications to publicize
successful programmatic products.<P>
<h3>IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS</H3>

<HR>
If scientific and engineering solutions to environmental problems are to be tested
and implemented, they first must be accepted by regulatory agencies and the public. 
To gain acceptance, a host of ethical, legal (including regulatory), and social
questions must be identified and addressed.  Some examples are:<P>
<MENU>
o               How does the public perceive bioremediation?<p>
o               Is it safe to introduce bioengineered organisms into the environment?<p>
o               Will bioremediation lower contaminant levels enough to protect human health and
                the ecological systems?<p>
o               Is containment through microbial sequestration of metals and radionuclides an
                acceptable long-term solution?<p>
o               Is intrinsic bioremediation an acceptable alternative to a more aggressive
                remediation strategy?<p>
o               What are the implications of bioremediation for environmental justice
                concerns?<p>
</MENU>

The list of such questions is long and certain to change as our knowledge
increases.  The Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research Program will
support research and establish partnerships that address these questions.  The
program will work with regulatory agencies to develop guidelines for testing new
bioremediation procedures.  It will also develop strategies for safely testing the
effectiveness of bioengineered organisms and for assessing environmentally
acceptable end points for bioremediation.<P>
<H3>IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</H3>

<HR>
The startup and implementation of the program will begin in FY96.  FY96 activities
will include (1) broad and general announcement of the NABIR program, (2) selection
of the scientific team leaders, (3) formation of the initial scientific team
through a competitive process, (4) selection of the first field research center
site, (5) evaluation of R&D shared infrastructure requirements, (6) identification
of ethical, legal, and social issues that must be addressed immediately, and (7)
identification of the interagency steering committee.  By FY97, the management
structure will have evolved from the startup mode to the model described above.<P>
                <B>Announcement of the NABIR Program</B><p>
                                Announcement of the NABIR program will be made through the <I>Commerce Business
                Daily</I> (CBD), direct mailing to research organizations and other federal
                agencies, presentations at technical meetings, and the World Wide Web.<P>
                <B>Selection of Scientific Team Leaders</B><p>
                                Scientific team leaders will be selected through a competitive process.  A
                solicitation requesting a statement of qualifications will be distributed to the
                scientific community for each of the program elements.  Responses will be reviewed
                by OHER with assistance from the program office.  Team leaders will be selected
                based on their scientific qualifications, ability and desire to lead and work in
                a team, and level of commitment to the program.<p>
                <B>Formation of the Initial Science Team</B><p>
                                The initial science team will be formed by a competitive solicitation for projects
                within each of the program elements.  Panels of scientific peers will review and
                rank proposals and make recommendations to OHER.  Proposals will be selected based
                on the scientific quality of the proposed work and relevance of the work to the
                goals of the program.<p>
                To ensure the maximum relevance of all proposals, detailed information on
                contaminants and hydrogeologic settings of interest will be provided in the
                requests for proposals.<p>
                <B>Selection of the First Field Research
                Center</B><p>
                                Selection of the first field research center will be completed during FY96.  It
                will involve a three-step process.  First, through interviews with EM headquarters
                and field office personnel, high priority mixtures of contaminants will be
                identified that are likely to be remediated by natural or accelerated
                bioremediation.  Next, a set of requirements for the field research centers will
                be identified.  Examples of requirements for the field research center include:<p>
                <MENU>
                1.  Level of interest of the site managers.<P>
               2.   Nature and composition of the contaminant mixture.<p>
               3.   Geologic/hydrologic setting.<p>
               4.   Availability of site for long-term research.<p>
               5.   Likelihood of co-locating a technology demonstration project nearby.<p>
               6.   Infrastructure needs and costs.<p>
               7.   Regulatory relationships and motivation for innovation.<p>
               8.   Opportunities or commitments for cost sharing.<p>
               9.   Qualifications of the field research center manager.<p>
                </MENU>
                Finally, OHER will issue a call for statements of interest from DOE sites.  A
                subset of these statements will be selected for further discussion and
                negotiations, and one or more will be selected.<p>
                <B>Evaluation of R&D Shared Infrastructure
                Requirements</B><p>
                                The program office will sponsor a workshop for the scientific community where
                instrumentation, database, and shared-model needs will be identified and
                prioritized.  Based on the results of the workshop, the program office will make
                recommendations to OHER for infrastructure and equipment investments.<p>
                <B>Identification of Ethical, Legal, and Social
                Impacts</B><p>
                                In the first quarter of FY 1996, a solicitation for proposals to identify ethical,
                legal, and social issues relevant to bioremediation will be distributed to
                universities, the private sector, and public interest groups.  A team will be
                selected and asked to identify key issues that must be addressed immediately and
                those that must be addressed over the life of the program.  A workshop will then
                be held to provide broad participation and input into the program by interested
                parties.<p>
                <B>Identification of the Interagency Steering
                Committee Members</B><p>
                                Members of the interagency steering committee will be identified and engaged in the
                planning and implementation process.  Members may include participants from EM's
                Office of Technology Development, Environmental Remediation and Waste Management,
                the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Geological Survey, the U.S.
                Bureau of Mines, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Agriculture,
                the Department of Defense, and other agencies with related programs.<p>
                <H3>PEER REVIEW AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES</H3>
                
<HR>
Two types of peer review will be incorporated into the program management --
programmatic peer review and project peer review.  Both of these peer review
processes will be used to encourage and create interdisciplinary teams.<P>
Programmatic peer review will be used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the
program and how well the program is achieving the goals identified in the program
element section.  Programmatic peer reviewers will make recommendations about how
the content and structure of the program can be improved.  Programmatic peer
reviews will take place one, three, five, and ten years into the program.<p>
Project peer review will consist of conventional scientific peer review of
individual projects conducted by members of the scientific community from academia,
government agencies, and industry.  Peer review will take place for initial
selection of projects and biannually thereafter.<p>
In addition to peer review, other performance measures will be used to evaluate if
the program is successful.  These will include:<p>
<MENU>
1.              Quality and quantity of new knowledge generated by the program<p>
2.              Effectiveness of the interdisciplinary teams<p>
3.              Timely accomplishments of programmatic goals<p>
4.              Application of knowledge or techniques to bioremediation or to otherwise help
                solve DOE problems<p>
5.              Spin-off to other areas such as pollution prevention, ecosystem studies,
                biomedical applications, ecotoxicity, and human genome.<p>
</MENU>
A program of this scale and complexity may require midcourse changes or
corrections.  The mechanisms described above will provide an early warning of the
need for such changes or corrections and help focus the program to maintain its
effectiveness.<p>
