          Portable Conditioning Tool&nbsp;</font></h2>
          <p align="center"><font size="1">by Alan Lambert</font></p>
          <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">Introduction</font></h3>

<p><font size="1">One of the most misleading phrases I have heard made over the
years is what great shape basketball players are in.&nbsp; There is some partial
truth to that statement but what I have observed more often than not, as a coach and player,
is that players are in some shape but could be better conditioned if they
knew how to condition.&nbsp; Modern science tells us that we need some
combinations of aerobic and anaerobic physical exertion if we are to be in the
best shape possible, and that the conditioning programs we undertake must be
balanced in accordance with those aerobic/anaerobic demands.&nbsp; For
basketball players, you need both.&nbsp; Players who argue they don't need to
run, swim or bike long distances fail to realize that the aerobic baseline you create by doing these types of activities is what helps you maintain
physical endurance and stamina late into a long season.&nbsp; It is not
something you can do on occasion for with any lasting positive effect.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1">Just as important to a basketball player is having a conditioning/athletic
development program that
includes elements such as Plyometrics, jumping, running technique, and strength
training which&nbsp; facilitate your body's ability to quickly convert energy
resources into quick, powerful, explosive burst so critical to dynamic play in
basketball.&nbsp; You notice your anaerobic capacity most when you have to
sprint the court 3 or 4 times quickly in succession, changing directions several
times on a change of ball possession during a game.&nbsp; If you become
exhausted from this court experience and it takes you more than a time out, a
couple of free throws, or a quarter break to recover your power, you need to
work on increasing your anaerobic threshold.</font></p>
          <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">Creating A Good Practice Habit</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">The reason I bring up the subject of conditioning is that
summer is upon us.&nbsp; It is a great time to change your workout habits to incorporate
tools that will improve your basketball conditioning over the course of your
basketball career.&nbsp; Playing a lot will help, but it will not tax your
system enough to stretch your conditioning threshold the way that additional
          training specific exercises can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure when you begin a new workout regimen
that you consult a certified athletic trainer, or sport physician so that you
have a proper physical examination, and have their professional expertise prior
to starting strenuous changes to your current workout programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1">I discovered one effective method for improving both aspects
of your physical condition (aerobic and anaerobic) in an innocent way many years
ago as a young player. A basketball teammate of mine (who eventually became a
major league baseball player, and a pretty good one at that) use to come into the
gym and warm-up with the ROPE each day prior to practice.&nbsp; He would challenge others to jump with
him.&nbsp; I though I was in pretty good shape, being able to chase up and down
the court in a pressing style team for several hours a day.&nbsp; The truth was
that I lacked balanced conditioning, of which I became painfully revealed aware when my body completely gave out after jumping continuously at about the
10 minute mark.&nbsp; My WELL conditioned teammate could jump for 45 minutes
straight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am in no way telling you to go out and begin with 45
minutes.&nbsp; I just mention it as a comparison between being well conditioned and WELL
CONDITIONED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1"> Rope jumping&nbsp; is a simple conditioning method,
doesn't cost a lot, and you can do it almost anywhere at any time.&nbsp; In my
experience it is probably one of, if not the most effective method for determining your
physical fitness as well as having almost unlimited capacity to assist you in
improving on your current state of condition for playing basketball.&nbsp; For the cost of a movie date you can purchase a high quality jump
rope and take it with you to your individual workouts, use it to warm-up prior
to playing,&nbsp; and travel with it wherever you go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's
Playground Pointer is written to introduce you the basics of rope jumping and
learn more about a tool that can get you into and keep you in shape throughout
the season.&nbsp;&nbsp; My question to you young players today is a rhetorical
but important one, ARE YOU PHYSICALLY ON THE ROPES?&nbsp; If not you should be.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FF9900" size="1">Basketball Fitness the Efficient Way&nbsp;</font></h3>
<p><font size="1">Rope jumping will improve your aerobic and anaerobic power and
capacity.&nbsp; It will also help with body coordination, balance, agility and
foot speed.&nbsp; It increases upper body strength and improves foot and hand
quickness.&nbsp; You will also benefit from increased explosiveness in your
basketball skills and will see some weight loss which will improve your mass to
power ratio.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most positive benefit of rope jumping is improved
cardiovascular fitness.&nbsp; Your heart is the muscle that drives the
car.&nbsp; A strong heart, let's you compete at the peak performance levels you
desire.&nbsp; When combined with improved skill and technique, championship
players have not only skill but the strength and stamina to compete well into
the fourth quarter and overtimes if necessary to overcome a stiff challenge from
a worthy opponent.&nbsp; Dr. Kenneth Cooper, the father of modern exercise
physiology, notes that 10 minutes of continuous rope jumping has the same
cardiovascular impact of bicycling over 2 miles in 6 minutes, swimming for 12
minutes, playing two sets of tennis, running a mile in 12 minutes, or jogging
for 30 minutes.&nbsp; It would seem in our time crunched world where our minutes
are precious, that taking your rope along for 10 minutes of warm-up prior to
beginning practice each day would be a most productive way to get yourself into
better playing shape.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FF9900" size="1">Rope Jumping Tips</font></h3>
<p><font size="1">Here are my suggestions for getting started with jumping rope
for conditioning:</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><i><font color="#800080">1. Purchase a good jump rope with ball-bearing swivel hinges
that do not bind up</font>.&nbsp;</i> Many people jump with plastic ropes which are okay
but personally I like a slightly weighted rope (leather is sturdy and long
lasting).&nbsp; Friction-less ball bearing hinges let the rope work freely
without binding allowing you to challenge the upper end of the number of speed
repetitions you can achieve during your jump rope workout.&nbsp; Rope that knot
themselves or get constantly tangled should be tossed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><i><font color="#800080">2. Jump with good shoes with adequate padding near the balls
of your feet, and on softer surfaces when possible</font></i>.&nbsp; Wooden basketball
courts, rubberized surfaces, level dirt, and indoor/outdoor carpeted surfaces
work well.&nbsp; Avoid concrete or extremely hard surfaces if you wish to avoid
over use injuries to your lower body as you increase your work load.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><i><font color="#800080">3. Jump slowly to begin warming up your body.</font></i>&nbsp; Muscle
fibers need blood flow to get into a more elastic pliable state which are more
easily stretched, and protected from injury.&nbsp; I would highly recommend
jumping easily for about 5 minutes, then stretching some without the rope before
beginning your 10 minute rope conditioning program.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i>4. When you are first learning different rope jumps, focus on
proper technique in hand position, rope position, and body position.</i></font>&nbsp; The
hands should be held about waist high and the wrists do the work of turning the
rope, not your arms.&nbsp; Your arms should remain virtually motionless through
the jumping exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you jump keep your hands held slightly
away from the body.&nbsp; The rope should clear your head by a few inches and
should be long enough to clear your feet without too much effort.&nbsp; The best
method for determining the proper length of a rope is to fold your jump rope in
half and hold one end at or near your armpit or shoulder.&nbsp; The handles
should just touch the floor.&nbsp; If the rope is too long you will unnecessarily
cause yourself&nbsp; more work in jumping and have trouble executing the more
difficult double and triple jumps.&nbsp; If the rope is too short, you will find
yourself constantly tripping over the rope and also unable to execute the
variety of jumps properly.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i>5. When you first begin start with basic footwork (bounce
steps, alternating footwork, straddle hops, lateral hops) up to about 5 minutes
a day.</i></font>&nbsp; Stop and rest when you are tired and you should jump with a 1:2
work to rest ratio.&nbsp; Meaning if you do a jump 30 seconds, then rest for
60.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the second week of jumping you should be able to increase
your workload to a 1:1 work to rest ratio and increase the total number of jumps
you do to a couple hundred.&nbsp; A third week of jumping should begin to bring
you to the point of being able to jump 5 minutes continuously at 120 turns per
minute, jumping 3 to 5 times per week.&nbsp; Again proceed at your own pace, if
you need to stop and rest do so.&nbsp; A good rhythm as you build your jump rope
conditioning skills is to plan on getting in about 5-10 different jump routines
into your 10 minutes and alternating either 1 minute of standing rest in-between
them or a active rest meaning you slow your rope down to a very low work rate in-between
the high energy demand skills.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i>6. When you jump, most professional rope jumpers will tell you
to let the rope slightly contact the jumping surface on each rope
rotation.&nbsp;</i></font> As a basketball player and coach, I always encouraged my players
to not let the rope hit the floor at all.&nbsp; This makes you hold the rope up
slightly, improving the muscular workout for the upper body, and will allow
slightly more speed as you do the speed jump drills.&nbsp; Another added trick I
used with my players is to have them keep jumping even as they foul a rope or
jump when possible.&nbsp; This keeps their heart beat up and does not permit
jump misses to break the continuous jumping rhythm.&nbsp; Early on it may be
necessary to stop to un-foul the rope, but as your jump rope skill level
improves, don't stop, except to rest.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i>7. Set goals for your jumping by either increasing the time of
a jump, and/or hopefully increase the rate of rope jumping.</i></font>&nbsp; Use the same
foot contact to count one repetition when alternating feet, or when jumping off
both feet each time they contact the court.&nbsp; When doing more complex
combinations you might want to count more like the Frappier drills where one
full sequence counts as one repetition.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i>8. Use music if it helps to
          motivate you.</i></font>&nbsp; Get your boom box out and put on a
          little high tempo music if you need some rhythm to stimulate your
          jumping.&nbsp; Of course don't irritate the neighbors in the process.</font></p>
<p><font size="1">Now that you have a basic idea how to get started let me
introduce you to a number of different jump roping drills you can
practice.&nbsp; You might note that some of the footwork I will introduce to you
is very similar to those in last month's Playground Pointer on Frappier Footwork
Drills, which is no coincidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rope Jumping however adds the

<p><font size="1">Here are some of the most common jumps you can use with a
rope:</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><i><font color="#800080" size="1"><b>1. Bounce Step</b></font></i>- Jump just high enough to clear the rope and
land on the balls of your feet as the rope rotates forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080" size="1"><i><b>2. Backwards</b></i></font>- Same as the bounce step but the rope rotates
from front to back over your head opposite a normal rope jump rotation.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080" size="1"><i><b>3. Alternating Feet</b></i></font>- Some people call this the jogging step,
simply keep the rope turning as you alternate feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>4. High Knees</b></i></font>- This is an extension of the alternating feet,
but involves bringing your knees up toward your chest as far as possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>5. Lateral Hops</b></i></font>- Keep both feet together on the rope rotation
and jump slightly from one side of a mid-line dissecting your body into left and
right halves.&nbsp; As you become more skills and coordinated with this jump,
stretch the lateral distance you are jumping.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><i><font color="#800080"><b>6. The Lone Ranger</b></font></i>- Also called the straddle hop.&nbsp; Start
with one foot forward and on each rope rotation alternate your right and left
feet from front to back positions.&nbsp; A variation of this might be to leave
your right foot forward for 2 or 3 rotations, then switch to left foot forward,
or any combination or variations.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>7. Half Twister</b></i></font>- Jump off both feet and while in the air on
the rope rotation, rotate only the lower portion of your body slightly to the
right, then slightly to the left on the next rope rotation.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>8. Full Twister</b></i></font>- This is similar to the Half Twister only this
time you allow the full body to turn completely to the right, and then
completely to the left.&nbsp; The rope remains relatively motionless while the
body continues to twist and turn.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>9. Criss-Cross</b></i></font>- While you are jumping on both feet you cross
both arms at waist level as you pull your hands out wide to create a big loop to
jump through as the rope crosses.&nbsp; On the second rotation, you uncross the
rope, and so forth.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>10. Horse Taps</b></i></font>- In this one-foot touch jump you alternate
right and left foot crossing over the midline of the body (see lateral hops)
beginning with the right foot crossing over the mid-line to the left side of the
body on the first rotation, followed by the left foot crossing over to the right
side of the body and so forth on each successive rotation.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>11. Bounders</b></i></font>-
          This jump is similar to alternating feet but instead of seeing how
          fast you can jump you turn the rope more slowly and you bound down the
          &quot;track&quot; alternating feet.&nbsp; This is a drill used in
          teaching better running technique and in this example you just add the
          rope to the bounders.&nbsp; The object is to make your legs work power
          wise, minimizing the amount of contact time on the court, while still
          coordinating the rope jump.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>12. Kick-Outs</b></i></font>-
          This drill alternates feet but instead of a normal bounce you kick
          your feet out in front of you as far as you can without loosing your
          balance.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>13. Hip-Hop</b></i></font>-
          In this drill you land on both feet but you jump as far forward as you
          can on one rope rotation, and follow with with a jump as far back as
          you can on the next rotation, continuing to alternate forward and back
          hops.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>14. Double/Triple Jumps</b></i></font>-
          Here you use one of the basic footwork jump patterns, most commonly
          bounces and make the rope turn 2 or 3 rotations on each jump. It
          requires both power, coordination, timing, and great conditioning to
          turn sets of double or triples over a given period of time.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><font color="#800080"><i><b>15. X Out's-</b></i></font>
          Here you cross your right and left legs back and forth over one
          another on each rotation of the rope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
          <h3><font color="#FF9900" size="1">Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">Keep in mind that the best jump rope routines are
          continuous in nature, keep proper rope jumping technique in mind, and
          alternate between periods of high and low intensity to allow your body
          to recover.&nbsp; You can increase or decrease the intensity by
          changing between the types of jumps, (for example bounces-low
          intensity, low reps to doubles- high intensity-high reps, to horse
          taps-low intensity-low reps, etc).&nbsp; Experience, and your legs
          providing you discomfort feedback will give you an idea of which
          drills are more demanding on you than others.&nbsp; When a drill
          becomes relatively simply then work in increasing the number of reps
          in the same amount of time by increase the speed of rope rotation.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">There are many ways you can condition yourself as a
          basketball player, but few will both challenge you and provide greater
          benefit than picking up the rope and doing a daily workout.&nbsp; Are
          you physically on the ropes?&nbsp; If not, maybe you have better get
          started.</font></p>
