I had great notes on theentire semis-finals action, but after an intense search at the fieldsthe day after, and ripping my hotel room apart, I have lost thesenotes. So what comes next is purely from my lousy memory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">First match of the finals (all singlegames) pitted Heartland USA and Japan#1. Heartland won, although noteasily. The second match of the semis was intense. Team ROC Taiwanbeat Japan#2 33-31, after an intense session of catching in overtime.It was a fantastic match to watch, and Japan#2 was emotionallycrushed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">First losers bracket match found Japan#1defeating Japan#2, in a good match. Team ROC lost to Heartland in ahard fought match. Then ROC put out Japan #1 to get to thefinals.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Paul "Fungi" Ganus took over 4 hours ofvideo, with some great interviews and shots. I will get copies of theraw video, and determine better the details.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Thanks for your patience.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Nez</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">P.S.--I have been asked to chair the Gutscommittee of the WFDF, in support of the game. In the next few weeks,I will be posing manyimportant questions on the organization,financings, and desires of the Guts Players Association and the Gutscommunity in general. I may be willing, with the players support, torun the GPA organization in conjunction with the WFDF to try andreinvigorate the sport. What do you think? I don't want to step ontoes, and I live in Texas, not exactly a mecca of Guts. But I amwilling to put in the time. Do I have your support?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><I>----- </I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">To all those who couldnt make the WFDFtourney this year, you missed a really good time.  Its a muchdifferent tourney than any US tournies I can remember and I will tryto give you a quick breakdown on what I saw there. The US fielded 4good teams, but most of them havent played together much or at all,so the first matches were played by teams trying to get used to theirteamates and in a very high headwind/tailwind.  Not real good Gutsthe first day for the US teams, with the exception of Library Bar,they played great. The Japanese and ROC teams have all very youngplayers that play Guts all the time.  I arrived at the fields onTuesday around 1pm and left around 6pm.  The ROC and Japanese teamswere practicing the whole time!  Both of these countries players arein much better Guts shape than any of the US teams.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">The format allowed all teams to play eachother at least one time.  We<I> </I>(Queen City Flyers) played ourfirst match against Japan Team 2 (the younger team).  They playedvery well into the wind, while we basically dumped too many shots towin the match.  I dove for a disc and tore my rotator cuff in myright shoulder (not good).  Our next match pitted us against HelterSkelter.  A few unnamed gratious players loaded my palms with theselarge white tablets that allowed me to at least get on the lineagainst H.S.  This match reminded me of old times, lots of argueingon almost every shot.  I think Nez had been drinking a tad, becausehe had trouble seeing the shots the same way we saw them :) .  Ligeplayed extremely well through this match and we finally won our firstof two matches in the tourney.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Our mext match pitted us against LibraryBar.  Before this match started, Pat Tower (Windy City) showed up atthe tourney site and we quickly picked him up.  Pat replaced me inthe lineup, my tourney was over.  Lige, Rally, Skids, J.B., Gary andPat played really well, but we made too many mistakes to beatLibrary.  Library played very solid, no-mistake Guts and won. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Thursday morning, rumor had it that Buckhad left the tourney to go back to Marquette.  The last time I sawBuck was on Wednesday night and he was taste testing his latestbaking creation, Bucks Brownies.  What happened<I> </I>Buck?  Awriter from a national magazine was sent to to a story on Guts and healso had sampled these baked wonders.  He told me Thursday that hespent all of Wednesday night watching the walls of his hotel roomshrink on him.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">On Thurday, we played a very tough Hearlandteam.  They were starting to play really well as a team and beat usin 2 games, one very close.  Team ROC was next for us and we just ranout of gas.  They made zero mistakes against us and showe us why theyare World Champs.  We ended the day with our second tourney winagainst a suprisingly tough Bud Light team.   Our last match was onFriday morning against Japan 1.  This team was the oldest non-US teamfielded and in my opinion the weakest.  For us, it didnt matter if wewon or lost, this was our last match.  We played flat and ceded thematch in 3 games.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">I would like to congragulate Team ROC asthe 1998 WFDF Guts Champions, and also to Team USA Heartland. Heartland was the best team fielded by the US and came very close inbringing back the championship to the US. I would also like to thankBuck Bucanen and Lige Johnson for setting up this tourney.  Withoutthem, Guts would not have been part of the WFDF WorldCampionships.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><I>Mark Barry <BR>team USA Queen City Flyers</I></FONT></P><H2><HR><FONT FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#009900"><I>Day Two, Thursday, August20, 1998</I></FONT></H2><H3><FONT FACE="Helvetica">GUTS Match Scores</FONT></H3><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>Game(s) #4<BR></B>Helter Skelter defeats Bud Light 19-21, 21-10, 21-18<BR>Team Japan #1 defeats Library Bar 21-12, 21-14<BR>Team ROC defeats Queen City Flyers 21-13, 21-19<BR>Heartland defeats Team Japan #2 29-27, 21-13</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>Game(s) #5<BR></B>Heartland defeats Queen City Flyers 21-18, 21-18<BR>Team ROC defeats Library Bar 21-18, 21-19<BR>Team Japan #2 defeats Bud Light 21-19, 21-15<BR>Team Japan #1 defeats Helter Skelter 21-?, 21-?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>Game(s) #6<BR></B>Team ROC defeats Helter Skelter 21-18, 23-21<BR>Queen City Flyers defeat Bud Light 21-15, 19-21, 21-17<BR>Heartland defeats Library Bar 21-?, 21-?<BR>Team Japan #1 defeats Team Japan #2 21-?, 21-?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>Standings (after Day 2)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B><TABLE BORDER=0>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><B>TEAM</B></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><B>WINS/LOSSES</B></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><B>POINTS</B></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Team ROC Taiwan</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">6-0</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Heartland USA</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">5-1</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Team Japan #2</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">4-2</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Team Japan #1</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">4-2</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Library Bar</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">2-4</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Queen City Flyers</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">2-4</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Helter Skelter</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1-5 </FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Bud Light</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">0-6</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </B> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><H3><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>Final 4 Teams Set!</B></FONT></H3><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><I>Only 1 US Team StillAlive</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">The final four teams for the WFDF GutsChampionships have been set during the second day&#130;s action.Suprisingly, only 1 US team, Heartland USA will qualify for thesemis. Japan has qualified both its teams. Defending champion TeamROC Taiwan also has easily qualified, and will retain the top seed inthe semis, with Heartland USA retaining the second seed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">The last round robin match on Friday willsettle the seeding on the semifinal match, with a key match betweenTeam ROC Taiwan and Team Japan #2. If Team Japan #2 loses, they willhave to play Team ROC Taiwan again in the first game of the semis.Team Japan #1 will likely play Heartland USA in the semis, unlessthey lose to Queen City Flyers and Team Japan #2 wins their finalmatch.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Intense matches were abounding everywhere,as the wind died down a bit on a beautiful second day. As the onlyone reporting the action, I can only speak for some fantastic matchesof Helter Skelter with both Team Japan #1 and Team ROC Taiwan. Soaksof the chinese backhands were everywhere, and the infamous banteringof Helter Skelter were playfully returned by Team Taiwan throughoutthe match. Team Japan played a bit more competitively than playfully,but both were great matches.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><H2><FONT FACE="Helvetica">WFDF Congress Votes to Reinstate GUTS inthe Biannual Tourney</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><I>Dave "Nez" Nesbitt - Proxy GPARepresentative</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">After an inpassioned plea from Dave "Nez"Nesbitt and "Paul " Liu of Team ROC Taiwan and Fumio "Moro" Morookaof Japan Flying Disc Association, The World Flying Disc FederationCongress approved the reinstatement of the game of GUTS in itsbiannual tourney, once again entitled "WFDF World Ultimate and GutsChampionships". Although the Congress vote was 7-0 with 2abstensions, WFDF procedural rules may send the issue to committee.But with the strong support of Congress, approval is a foregoneconclusion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">The 2000 WFDF World Ultimate and GUTSChampionships will likely be held in Germany, as they present theonly at-large bid for hosting this tourney. The German delegation wascompletely supportive of Guts reintroduction. Issues that will needto be addressed by the Guts community in concert with WFDF includecoordinating vs conflicting schedules with the Ultimate tourney, andopen vs closed representation. I personally would like to send thethanks of the US based Guts Players Association to "Moro" of TeamJapan for providing the motivation to hold the 98 tourney and supportGuts reintroduction, to Team ROC Taiwan, "Paul" Liu for theirpassionate speech to save GUTS within the WFDF community, and to"Stork" Roddick for his steadfast and continuing support of oursport.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">YA, WE ARE BACK IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</FONT></P><H2><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><HR></FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#FF0000"><I>Day One, Wed.,August 19, 1998</I></FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">For you who have to know the InquiringDetails, Helter Skelter used its typical partying attitude to try andsabatoge the ROC team, by keeping their captain out until 3 in themorning, drinking the local finest. But to no avail, as ROC lookedreally strong.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Surprisingly to me, Heartland looks weakerthan expected, with lots of dumps by key members in their first dayof competition. Helter Skelter played sciszo guts, and Library reallystarted well in their win over us. We had hands all day, but dumpedenormous amounts of shots. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Didn't see much else, only drank the localpale ale.

A tough first round match of perhaps the top two Guts teams sawTeam Republic of China defeat Heatland USA in 3 games. Incrediblehands were shown by ROC, and too many dumps by Heartland. Said RogerHill of Heartland, "They were piping</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">it up the middle, with good shots into thewind." A ROC member commented Hair Begoske's shot was speedy, butROC's hands prevailed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">A major injury to Mark Barry of WCFoccurred during a diving attempt in their first round loss to TeamJapan #2. However he came back to play in a key win by Queen Cityover HelterSkelter in 3 games, after losing the first. Lige Johnsonshowed his deft skill with throwing in the wind, and soaking keyshots.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Nez dumped 5 shots, with a few others andkey wind play by Library Bar allowed them to defeat Helter Skelter in2 games. Perhaps the surprise of the tourney so far is Team Japan #2.This team of young throwers were untested by Queen City Flyers,Helter Skelter and Library Bar, defeating each in 2 games. Good handsdownwind, minimal dumps and accurate shots were their keys tovictories.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">At the end of the first day, Team ROC andTeam Japan #2 are positioned well to qualify for the semifinaltourney, with Team Japan #1 and Queen City Flyers needing a strongsecond day to maintain hope of advancing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>WFDF Congress Meeting Thursday GutsNeeds Your Support</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><I>Dave "Nez" Nesbitt - Team Japan (beentraded?)</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">The World Flying Disc Federation is holdingits annual congress meeting at the National Sports Center at 6 pm.

Its an infamous spot in Helter Skelter lore, where Corgfell from the rope while swinging over the river with Nez at thisside; racing to the hospital in an ambulance, and an overnight in St.Ignace with a drunk doc on call.

The topfour teams will advance to a single game, double elimination bracketbeing held on Friday afternoon, with a 2-of-3 game clean slate finalsmatch planned for 6 pm. Tie breakers in the round robin will behead-to-head results, followed by total point differential (pointsscored minus points allowed). Order of play will be determined byrandom draw into a preset round-robin format.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">A special WFDF Guts rule for this tourneywill be in effect. After the first 11 points in a game, teams will beallowed to switch players at will throughout the rest of the game.Otherwise, standard GPA Guts rules are in effect. These rules includeno point for a catch, the space ace rule (where the scoring team mayonly chose from players nearest the ace to return the throw), thesquared-off reach area in between two players will be considered agood shot, and the line being considered a foot fault if stepped uponduring a throw.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><H3><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Team Japan Brings 2 Teams!</FONT></H3><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Team Japan arrives with a huge group ofGuts players and fans, the first in North America since theirattendence at the 1986 GPA World Guts Championships in TorontoCanada.
