Norton, $29.95</I><HR><P>&quot;Of course the theory would be vacuous if itoffered a glib explanation for every inexplicable act.&quot; --Steven Pinker<P>Steven Pinker picked an ambitious title, <I>How theMind Works</I> (<I>HTMW</I>), and set off in the right direction,insisting that all human behavior should <I>not</I> be explainedby a single wonder principle. Unfortunately, Pinker's oppositionto oversimplification fades quickly, at two wonder principles:&quot;the mind is a system of organs of computation&quot; . .. &quot;designed by natural selection.&quot; What is more, wearrive at the end of his long book without ever having heard howthe mind works.<P>Pinker's approach to human behavior weds a particularaccount of cognition-a &quot;modular computational theory&quot;-toa particular account of how the mind emerged-&quot;evolutionarypsychology.&quot; According to the modular theory, the mind comprisesa set of discrete faculties or &quot;mental organs&quot; thatperform separate tasks and operate on distinct principles: bite-sizedrecipes for figuring out, say, whether that wispy patch lurkingabove is a cloud or weasel, that draw on distinctive kinds ofinformation, distinctively processed. Cognition emerges as thejoint product of these separate modules, each operating in itsown domain, not as the reflex of Reason or general problem-solvingintelligence. According to the evolutionary psychologist, the discrete problem-solving devicesthat constitute the human mind evolved because they solved problemsfaced by small nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers in the environmentin which humans evolved-problems of mate selection and navigatingone's way through the veldt. In short, your behavior reflectsa mind that formed by adapting to the environment, 100,000 yearsago on the African savanna.<P>As evolutionary past becomes present prologue, naturalselection gives us a variety of genetically-based subroutines for solvingspecific problems-what to eat, whom to spend time with (and whatto do with that time), and how to get around at night. We retainthese evolutionary residues, sometimes in inappropriate moderncontexts. When you find yourself reaching for the potato chips,it is because high-caloric fatty foods were once scarce but valuablein the Pleistocene, so our hominid ancestors who developed a genetically-groundedtaste for fats did better, on average, at getting their potato-chipgenes into future generations.<P>The unhappy results of these efforts to marry cognitivescience to an adaptationist brand of evolutionary biology area credulous conception about how the mind works (misrepresentedas scientific consensus), an uncritical genetic determinism, anda borrowed evolutionary biology used not to generate hypotheses,but to rationalize Pinker's own opinions.<P><B>The Mind</B><p>Pinker's analysis ranges far and wide, covering perception,reasoning, emotion, social relations, and the higher activitiesof art, religion, and philosophy that Hegel assigned to the realmof Absolute Spirit. Pinker makes the spirit flesh, or more precisely,gene. Our yen for green suburban lawns is an evolutionary memoryof the green hills of Africa; we love abstract art (or do not)because shapes that please us are good art; mathematical thinkingis all bootstrapped on primate visualization; parent/child rivalryand wicked stepparents result from promoting one's genes at theexpense of others, be they siblings, parents, or step-children;older men prefer to marry younger women, and women prefer wealthiermen because youth and wealth are visible proxies for fitness.<P>If you are thinking that you have read such near-tabloidheadlines before, you are right. They descend directly from early 1970s &quot;pop&quot; sociobiology, with but a few differences.In the late 1970s, Richard Alexander (<I>Darwinism and Human Affairs</I>) and Donald Symons (<I>Human Evolution and Sexuality</I>),among others, turned sociobiology from focusing on the adaptivevalue of individual behaviors-such as &quot;men marry youngerwomen&quot;-to a handful of modular mechanisms such as &quot;mateselection&quot; that <I>result</I> in those behaviors. For men,this means a module for identifying fertile and healthy females,and for women, a module to snag males who will be the most stablelong-term providers of resources. This shift in the unit of selectionfrom behavior to mechanism paralleled a sea-change in cognitivescience; from a conception of the mind as a general-purpose computerto the Cartesian picture of the mind as a bundle of mental &quot;organs,&quot;with separate units for language, theory-formation, visual perception,morality, and so forth. Pinker attempts to reanimate the pop sociobiologyarguments by fusing Darwin with claims that the mind is modular.<P>In this project, he follows a new breed of sociobiologists,led by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, who aim to explain humanculture via evolutionary history, and undermine something theycall the Standard Social Science Model, which (they say) ignoreshuman evolutionary history and personal psychology, uses the category&quot;culture&quot; to explain sociological observations, andso on-eleven sins in all.<SUP><A HREF = "#1">1</a></SUP> In pursuit of thisambition, they argue that the mind is a set of problem-solvingmodules, each of which can be independently optimized; that thereis less human variance and cultural diversity and less learningfrom our cultures than you might think; and, correspondingly,that more of human life reflects the intrinsic features of ourmental modules than we might wish to suppose. Following Alexanderand Symons, they focus on the adaptive value of the <I>mechanisms</I>that result in behaviors, rather than the behaviors themselves.Moreover, they hope to avoid political objections by concentratingon common traits, not individual, sexual, and racial differences.<P>All the evolutionary storytelling that has emergedfrom this line of work is interesting; reductive, counter-intuitiveexplanation always is. But is any of it true? Telling &quot;justso&quot; stories is too easy. We can always rationalize a particularbehavior or trait by inventing a past that must have selectedfor it, and plausibility just does <I>not</I> narrow the field.Indeed, Philip Kitcher's criticism of the earlier generation ofwork applies with full force to the latest round:<P>&quot;Again and again . . . assertions about human naturebegin with unrigorous analyses of fitness, . . . deal looselywith data about human and animal behavior, . . . employ problematicconcepts, . . . rely on dubious connections between optimalityand selection, and . . . offer spurious arguments for the inflexibilityof the phenotype.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#2">2</a></SUP> <P>What is worse, &quot;good old&quot; sociobiologyat least had the virtue of testability. Its claims were aboutoptimal behaviors in the here-and-now. By recognizing that ittakes time for optimal &quot;solutions&quot; to stabilize andthat our present culture is in flux, the new sociobiology pushesthe adjudicating evidence far back into the past, sometimes 1-2million years to the Pleistocene and <I>Homo erectus</I>, sometimes100,000 years to early <I>Homo sapiens</I>. It is not clear howwe will ever test these claims of optimal behavior. It is hardenough to tell today whether one warbler's preference for nestbuilding has a selective advantage over another's-so hard thatthe textbooks usually cite only a handful of cases, like Kettlewell'sblack moths that could hide better against British smog-darkenedtree trunks (even this story has become more difficult to defend).<SUP><A HREF = "#3">3</a></SUP> As the evolutionary biologist Elizabeth Vrba reminds us, criticalevidence about past environmental and selectional regimes simplydo not leave strong traces. Worse, how does one track those selectionpressures that modify behavior and leave nothing to fossilizebehind?<P>Amidst all these unknowns, <I>HTMW</I> offers noneof the cold skeptical eye that readers deserve. These still-contentiousfields-and the still-more tendentious details sketched above-donot provide the confident prediction and understanding that wefind in modern physics, chemistry, or even molecular biology.Indeed, <I>HTMW</I> goes the &quot;just so&quot; stories one better,transforming them into what might be dubbed &quot;just say&quot;stories. Pinker &quot;just says&quot; that suburban lawns serveas evocative evolutionary memories, like Proust's madeleines remindingus of our distant past. <I>HTMW</I>  &quot;just says&quot; that99 percent of our evolution took place on the savanna. It shouldbe unnecessary to point out that savannas with five- to fifteen-foot-tallgrasses and one-foot-short grasses punctuated by acacia treesdo not quite look like suburban lawns. One might just as wellsay that our love for hot-tubs follows from what is <I>really</I>true, that over 99 percent of our evolutionary history was spentin (and most of our genes arose in) a warm, salty, sea.<P>And so it goes, breathless tale after tale. The &quot;besttheory&quot; about sex, we are told, is that it arose &quot;asa defense against parasites and pathogens.&quot; A recent reportby Evelyn J. Lyons should temper such conviction.<SUP><A HREF = "#4">4</a></SUP> Scientists disagree about the origins of sex, and the parasite/pathogentheory is just one among several. In the green algae <I>Chlamydomonasreinhardtii</I>, &quot;sex can serve both for mutation clearanceand mutation assembly although no parasites are involved.&quot;We simply do not know enough to reach a solid conclusion and thereis no strong consensus to report.<P>Pinker also tells us that &quot;much of the variationin personality-about fifty percent-has genetic causes&quot;; and&quot;the biggest influence that parents have on their childrenis at the moment of conception.&quot; Really? Technical measuresof the &quot;heritability&quot; of personality-the tendency foroffspring to resemble their parents-show correlations, not &quot;geneticcauses.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#5">5</a></SUP> Contrast Marcus Feldman's entry in <I>Keywords in EvolutionaryBiology</I>: &quot;heritability is statistical in nature and doesnot involve a detailed specification of genetic or environmentaltransmission.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#6">6</a></SUP>Feldman goes on to note that statements in the popular press,such as Deborah Franklin's 1989 claim in the <I>New York Times</I>that &quot;genes are 50 percent to 70 percent responsible foran individual's IQ,&quot; not only over-state the numbers, butalso, just like <I>HTMW</I>, &quot;incorrectly infer causationfrom correlation.&quot; <SUP><A HREF = "#7">7</a></SUP> Our goal here is not to resolve the nature/nurture controversy.It has not been resolved, and it is bizarre for a scientist andirresponsible for a reporter to suggest otherwise. Pinker's assertionis simply the authority of modern science pressed into the service of speculativefictions-truly biology as ideology.<P>Once we begin to challenge Pinker's reporting, thenatural question is whether any of the stories in <I>HTMW</I>have empirical support. We will not unpack each example in thebook, but here is a sampling. Are wicked stepparents and parent-childconflict the natural outcome of genetic-payoff investment calculations?<I>HTMW</I> relies on readers' willingness to supply examplesfrom their own lives and takes direction from evolutionary anthropologistRobert Trivers's calculus of &quot;parental investment&quot; and I'll-scratch-your-back-and-you-scratch-mine&quot;reciprocal altruism.&quot; Performing these calculationsis difficult. Even if you suspend biological intuition long enoughto imagine that a single mutation in the DNA coding for a proteincan turn selfish behavior altruistic, or that a population hassimply segregating genetic materials that carry selfishness oraltruism (a requirement for many of these models), the calculationof what is called &quot;inclusive fitness&quot; is difficult fororganisms that are diploid-that is, whose chromosomes carry twoalleles (copies) of every gene. The calculation is simplifiedby assuming that people are like ants or bees where sisters (queensand workers) are haploid, having only one allele or the other,while the brothers are diploid. This means that sisters sharemore genes with each other than they do with their brothers, anddaughters (a sterile caste) would pass on more of their genesif their mother produced more sisters than if they themselveswent on to mate. Pinker relies on Trivers's assumptions whichdo not carry over as easily for organisms in which both sexesare diploid-like people.<SUP><A HREF = "#8">8</a></SUP> <P>The point is that the dirty details of populationgenetics matter-what geneticist Richard Lewontin dubs &quot;theauto mechanics of evolution.&quot; Sadly, <I>HTMW</I> never evenpops the hood. Again, we are not proposing to make a definitivestatement on the dynamics of altruistic gene types in a population,but to insist that blissfully blinkered reporting on a non-existentconsensus is irresponsible.<P>Even <I>HTMW</I>'s centerpiece argument for the modularityof mind-an otherwise skillful retelling of David Marr's computationaltheory of vision, the &quot;2dimensional sketch&quot;-falls prey to reporting finality. InMarr's approach, when we &quot;see&quot; a cup, the eyes and brainindependently compute bits of information about the cup's orientation,surface texture, slant, depth, and tilt, using <I>different</I>algorithms-the very essence of modularity. The resulting sketchis 2-H-Dbecause we interpret and apply more information than just the2-D shapes that fall onto our retinas. <I>HTMW</I> trumpets Marr'stheory as Gospel: &quot;The 2-H-Dsketch is the masterwork of the ingeniously designed, harmoniouslyrunning machinery of the visual system.&quot; There is a hitch:practically no one believes in the 2-H-Dsketch anymore! The reason it has fallen from favor cuts to thevery heart of Pinker's game plan. Nobody in the computationalvision business figured out how to <I>combine</I> the various<I>local</I> bits of orientation, texture, slant, or depth informationto pitch up a <I>global</I> answer to what has actually been seen-especiallywhen the local pieces of information disagree. (This is a verydifferent problem from the one Pinker goes on to worry about,the &quot;reference frame&quot; the observer uses.) Attempts toweight the various local pieces of evidence and assign relativecosts to build a trade-off schedule have not succeeded. For nearlytwenty years scientists at MIT have worked on this problem. Thethree most serious computational efforts at complete 2-H>-Dsketch implementations-the MIT Vision Project, Ballard and Brown'sat the University of Rochester, and Tennebaum and Barrow's atthe Stanford Research Institute-have failed to produce &quot;harmoniouslyrunning machinery.&quot; <SUP><A HREF = "#9">9</a></SUP> <P>You would never know <I>any</I> of this from reading<I>HTMW</I>. At every turn, those familiar with the topic wouldfind alternatives, but Pinker supplies no corresponding doubts.Pinker takes refuge from this responsibility, suggesting he isparticipant, not reporter: &quot;I have not given comprehensiveliterature reviews or an airing of all sides of every debate.&quot;But this defense misses an important point. Some of <I>HTMW</I>'sspeculations might be true, but we have no way of finding out.Part of the problem of marshaling the necessary evidence is thatin adaptationist histories/fictions that Pinker so fancies thereis no end to plausible story telling. In addition a commitmentto a modular brain does not stop us from continuously inventingnew modules. Pinker knows that we can always replace one adaptive story by another or add more modules as required, but offers us no way to reasonably refrain from doingso.<P><B>Reductionism</B><BR><I>HTMW</I>is also in the grip of genetic reductionism, this era's most relentlesslyreductionist recipe. A behavior like &quot;incest avoidance&quot;gets boiled down to a simple heritable trait. From atomic traitwe run a &quot;reverse engineered&quot; straight line to an equallyatomic, modular recipe or &quot;algorithm&quot; that computesthe trait. From this modular algorithm, we take a beeline to thefundamental heredity particles themselves-genes. At this level,evolution by natural selection boosts some gene frequencies andlowers others. Roughly speaking, a gene leading to a behavior that increases that gene's representation in succeedinggenerations will be &quot;more fit&quot; than alternatives that(in this example) permit incest, presumably because the incest-admittinggene-behavior leads to some deleterious side-effect that lowersthe number of &quot;incest-permitting genes.&quot; Over time,the &quot;incest-avoidance gene&quot; will tend to replace itsalternative. For psychologists, the gene-to-behavior bait is especiallytempting, because connect-the-dots atomicity and determinism makescognitive science easy.<P>You need not believe a word of it. The long trekfrom patterns of external behavior to genes has many steps andat each one <I>HTMW</I> stumbles. If genes are to serve as accuratebookkeeping chits for maximizing fitness, all the way to love'sblushes, then the dotted lines from genes to behaviors must runstraight and true. Any deviation, any non-determinism or interactionbetween and among the stepping-stones, and our explanatory holdslips. Such slippage is found at every step. For every behaviorthere are many possible traits underlying it; for every trait,many possible &quot;algorithms&quot;; for every algorithm, manypossible modules (or perhaps a generalized multipurpose moduleand not specific ones); for every module, many genes that interact,and so no simple way to &quot;maximize fitness.&quot; In realitywe do not have a story for <I>any</I> causal chain from genesto behavior-molecular biologists simply talk as if they do. Goingthe other direction, from traits to genes, is harder still. Evenif there were a completely deterministic relationship betweengenes and phenotypes (behavior, morphology, etc.), we would stillhave no guarantee that similar phenotypes are produced by thesame genes. To map from a behavior like &quot;incest avoidance&quot;to a &quot;trait&quot; that might have a coherent evolutionaryhistory like eye color, one must assume that behaviors segregatejust like the wrinkled or yellow peas in Mendel's garden-thatis, independently-and that those gene frequencies reached equilibrium100,000 years ago. Natural selection demands such independenceso it can &quot;see&quot; features individually and pluck themout for attempted optimization. But as soon as one moves beyondthe simplest case-one trait with two gene types like &quot;wrinkledpeas/non-wrinkled peas&quot;-to <I>three</I> possible trait-determinants,then natural selection need not maximize fitness anymore-selectionmight home in on the <I>most unfit</I> combination of all.<SUP><A HREF = "#10">10</a></SUP> We are not claiming that unfit combinations will always win out,just that interesting complications can occur and that Pinkernever alerts readers to this possibility.<P> Do &quot;mate selection&quot; or &quot;aggression,&quot;for example, really possess the required Mendelian &quot;atomistic&quoindependence to be plucked out and optimized without referenceto other features of an organism? Probably not. They are moreproperly an interconnected bundle of behaviors and strategies.For example, do we know that &quot;mate selection&quot; reallydepends on just two genetic variants? Mate selection may be theresult of a large number of interconnected factors that makesknee-jerk fitness-optimization difficult. Pinker does not emphasizethis possibility at all, assuming that the traits he would liketo naturalize are independent and unconstrained, waiting onlyfor a good story to be explained away.<P>How does Pinker's use of selectionism go so wrong?Selectionist explanations come in two modes. In the first, selectionis invoked simply to rationalize a situation. Because anythingthat exists must in some sense have out-survived what has not,we have a survival of the fittest where the fittest are preciselythose who survive. This kind of selectionist explanation is toopowerful for its own good, as any status quo becomes the inevitablebut trivial outcome of selection. <P>Selectionism as used by evolutionists demands a bitmore. In &quot;natural selection&quot; there must be varianceamong the objects under consideration, heritability of some ofthe features and a winnowing of the objects across the generationsso that some subset remain to represent the population and reproduce:random variation, heritability and selective retention. When youhear &quot;natural selection designed this&quot; or &quot;createdthat,&quot; all of the credit seems to accrue to the selectionpart of the process. However, laying the credit at selection'sdoor is possible only when the variation is not correlated withthe needs of the population, when the variation is copious, whenthere is no bias in the process of heritability, <I>and </I>whenthe selection is not carried out with a plan in mind.<P>If variation is meager, then the short menu of options-theconstraints-must get substantial credit for the results. Is anyonesurprised when they leave McDonald's with a burger and fries?Was Bill Clinton elected president thanks solely to popular selection?No. Many factors were involved in providing a near binary choiceat the polls and any responsible assessment of election resultsdiscusses those as well. If the process of inheritance was itselfbiased, then it would demand some of the credit for outcomes.If the selection was done with an agenda, as it is done in animaland plant breeding, then the selector should get much of the credit.Selection becomes &quot;natural selection&quot; when there isno breeder making decisions with a future goal in mind. A selectionistaccount must always implicitly include all of these elements:broad and undirected variance, heritability, and selection. <P>In evolutionary terms, <I>every</I> trait we examineis an admixture of physical constraints, natural selection andchance with history. These features are constitutive, not optional.Pinker presents a mutually exclusive conception pitting thesefactors against each other. This may result in part from his mixingup the two modes just described. There is little room for a moreelaborate explanation once you are on the selection-as-rationalizationtrack. For example, when explaining why rabbits have precociousbabies whose eyes are set within faces that grow very little,Pinker offers only the story that they tend to be prey animalsand implies that eye position is due solely to a reasonable needfor an early adult vision system. The lagomorphs (rabbits, hares,and pikas) are one of the earliest branches in the mammalian radiation,possibly as early as the late Cretaceous (more than 65 millionyears ago).<SUP><A HREF = "#11">11</a></SUP> Surely any claims about the details of rabbit development needto make reference to this history. Evolutionists care deeply aboutwhich characters are ancestral and which are derived in a lineage.Front-facing eyes may be a feature that marked the lineage early,part of what it is to be a rabbit and not an adaptation toa currentenvironmental pressure. All traits do not lend a current selectiveadvantage, the origin of traits and their maintenance do not demandthe same selectionist account. Pinker never embraces this distinctionas a vivid part of his adaptationism.<P>Stumbles with rabbits may not seem like much, butthis kind of mistake appears repeatedly in <I>HTMW</I>. If a traitis shared by all the individuals who share a common ancestor,we generally infer that the trait was present in the ancestorrather than having evolved independently in each separate lineage.(Of course, it did not have to go this way, but that is the startinghypothesis.) In contrast, when we have similar traits arisingin lineages whose shared common ancestor did not have this trait-forexample, flying structures in bats, birds, and pterosaurs-theresult is often explained by an appeal to convergence<I>.</I>Independent lineages with similar solutions give comparative biologistsa basis for reconstructing the pressure that were at work. Clearly,explaining the existence of wings in chickens, ducks, and eaglesseparately seems like a question at the wrong level of resolution.If the common ancestor lacked the trait and the populations underconsideration acquired the same traits over time, this may reflectcommon response to the same selection pressure, or it may reflectshared constraints on possible variants imposed on the differentlineages. We discussed the importance of menu size earlier. Ifwe assume that selection was the sole explanation for parallelevolution we might miss some important parts of the overall dynamicsof the changes in traits. <P>Consider an example: Pinker asks, &quot;Why don'twomen give virgin birth?&quot; Certainly the correct answer willnot make particular reference to humans. Mammals, including humans,just do not have this as a developmental option. Put otherwise,it would take more than just a shift in selection regimes to makehumans start reproducing asexually. For these reasons it is hollowbluster to talk about the selective advantage of sex <I>in humans</I>if the traits we are discussing evolved and became establishedlong before the human lineage branched.<P>If we are interested in a trait unique to a lineage-e.g.,language-it becomes very difficult indeed to make good inferencesabout selection. Pinker seems to be aware of the pitfalls of lookingat a single lineage and making a fetish of a particular trait.He compares the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence withan analogous research program among elephants, a search for extra-terrestrialswho have evolved unique and wonderful trait-the trunk. This strikingand lucid example helps to lay bare our obsession with our owntraits and the mistaken belief that they are inevitable. Likea light rain in the desert, it offers only fleeting relief, aswe are then immediately subjected to hundreds of pages that ignorethe warning. The difficulty of inferring selection pressures fromlineages that have unique traits (technically called &quot;autapomorphies&quot;)certainly does not stem our ability to tell stories, but it doescreate real problems in evaluating them.<P>Another part of challenge of evolutionary reconstructionis deciding what exactly the relevant traits are. How we pickout traits of an organism is critical. Central to the evolutionarypsychology project is the possibility of inferring the functionof biological structures and behaviors by &quot;reverse engineering.&quot;This naming makes it sound as if there is a hard-nosed approachto deconstructing functions. Clever naming aside, this is nota simple task. What is the function of the eye; to see, to cry,to witness? Even when there is a known design agenda (for example,the BIOS or &quot;basic input output operating system&quot; thatruns IBM PCs) engineers can find this job very difficult. Theengineers at Phoenix Technologies who &quot;cloned&quot; (copied)the IBM BIOS had all the trump cards that evolutionary scientistsdo not: they already knew what the program code was for, and hadIBM's published specifications for <I>every</I> subpart (i.e.,they knew for every subroutine, what the input and outputs shouldlook like). In addition they knew about previous designs, andwere operating system designers themselves. Still, it took manypeople several years to do the job; and, most importantly forthe evolutionary story, they came up with a <I>very different</I>&quot;reverse-engineered&quot; recipe or algorithm from IBM's.The vulgar adaptationism hawked in <I>HTMW</I> depends on allof the traits under consideration being independent enough ofeach other so that selection can pick them out and winnow withoutaffecting others. It is not at all obvious that this is true forthe kinds of mental abilities that <I>HTMW</I> discusses. Thus,as indicated earlier, we do not know whether vision, emotions,or language are modular in the way that Pinker &quot;just says&quot;they are.<P>For analytical convenience individuals can be seenas atomized parts. In a careful atomization of an organism intoits traits we notice that the parts are constrained due to themany other connected systems. The constraints and opportunitiesto change are due to the details of development, chance associationswith other features that may be strongly selected for or against,and finally selection on the trait itself. Darwin noted that suchlaws of &quot;correlation and balance&quot; would be of utmostimportance to his theory-&quot;cats with blue eyes are invariablydeaf.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#12">12</a></SUP> Even when we operate with care, after the analysis we must rememberthat it is we who atomized and reified the parts of the organism.They are not actually separate modules of replaceable parts inan assembly line.<P>In <I>HTMW</I> Pinker avoids attending to contingent,intertwined, interdependent features of an organism. He simplyasserts that &quot;complex adaptations&quot; are the result ofselection. But this separation does not happen easily. Featuresmix; the contingent, the constrained, the selected are part ofthe story all the way down. If Pinker cared more about evolutionarybiology, he would see that even the examples he favors have thisproperty. Eyes-while superficially very different (compound vs.various kinds of single lens eyes) and which presumably evolvedindependently-share important developmental regulatory elements,so much so that a fly gene involved early in the cascade of eyedevelopment can be rescued by a similar protein (its homolog)from mice. If function can be conserved in proteins that havebeen on independent evolution trajectories for hundreds of millionsof years, what does this tell us about the process of evolution?This is a deep and open question-one never raised in <I>HTMW</I>.<P>The problem of how we atomize an organism and itsbehaviors links back to Pinker's (ambivalent) embrace of mentalmodules. With all of his talk that the mind is computationallymodular, you might think that Pinker is committed to a reflectionof these <I>brain modules</I> in the structures of the brain,but he distances himself from this hypothesis. He commits to justthe bare necessities required to think of behavior as broken downinto mental modules. He does claim that &quot;modules&quot; areindependent enough to allow natural selection to pluck them outand optimize them independently-and this is where talk of &quot;gene(s)for&quot; a particular behavior comes from. Genes <BR>arranged as beads on a string (the chromosomes) sort out independently,and after a few generations of cell division and chromosomal crossingover, lose any correlation with their original neighbors. <P>Pinker proposes this same kind of independence forabstract mental modules. Notice that it would burden the storytellingto allow for strong correlations between modules. If the brainis too interdependent, then changes in one part demand changesin others, and the notion of unrestrained optimization of a singlemodule (mate selection, cheater detectors, language, responsesto landscapes, or other specialized psychological mechanisms)runs into trouble. <I>HTMW</I> does not suggest how to show thatmental modules are independent, or that they segregate in theway that, say, Mendel showed how the green and wrinkled peas assortedindependently. Moreover, this kind of evidence will be difficultto get. Since you can inherit all of the traits Pinker mentionsfrom <I>any</I> human, it is difficult to say anything about theirindependence. Further, to get from segregating genes to evolutionaryalgorithms one must further assume that these traits were heritablein the postulated past environment. However we construe heritability,it is not clear how we could calculate it 100,000 years ago-whereare we going to get the identical and fraternal twins?<P>Pinker's commitment to selectionist explanation atall costs comes to the fore when he discusses Frank Sulloway'sdubious suggestion that birth order is the main factor that explainsour willingness to accept new ideas. However you come down onSulloway's thesis, &quot;birth order&quot; is a clear exampleof environment, not inheritance, as a prime mover (later-bornchildren could <I>not</I> be expected on average to receive moregullibility genes from their parents). With the wind of adaptationismfilling his sails, Pinker must claim that the whole behavioralrepertoire response of first-borns or the inverse behavior oflater-borns is all selected for. This path through the gardenallows us to absorb <I>any </I>context into a trivial circularnotion of genic contribution to behavior.<P>We do not mean to suggest that some behaviors arenot adaptive. Surely the constraints of the physical world havefound their way inside our heads-after all, there <I>are</I> distinct,measured, neural channels for computing <I>what</I> and <I>where</I>objects are, and we do make use of shading and texture separately,somehow, to distinguish shape. The problem is that we are at thebeginning, not the end, of this story, and it is not yet clearhow to make sense of all the evidence.<P>We want to answer explicitly a concern that alwayscomes from adaptationists. There is an intuition that naturalselection is the only imaginable &quot;force&quot; that can createexquisite and intricate adaptations (all those wonderful examplesof teeming life that fill David Attenborough's TV specials). Thisdeep intuition results in sincere puzzlement at criticisms ofnatural selection as sweeping explanation. After all, if naturalselection is dismissed, that leaves only chance, magic, and theintentionality of the gods as counter explanations. Given thesechoices, natural selection surely must get the nod, and so itdoes. It should be clear however that an embrace of natural selectionin principle does <B>not</B> commit us to an enthusiasm for apromiscuous rationalization procedure that naturalizes every featureof an organism as an optimal and inevitable creation of naturalselection. Our complaint is with Pinker's use of  natural selectionas retrospective naturalization of the <I>status quo</I> and currentlyfashionable categories.<P>To give you a sense of the enormous challenge thatwe face in building a selectionist account that explains the currentdistribution and abundance of living forms imagine a parallelproblem. Anyone who has experienced the end of snow-filled winterhas noticed the gradual way that a few warmer spring days startto uncover the snow-covered ground. From this vantage you cantry to imagine what it would take to have a theory of snow melt.We might include variables like the heat capacity of snow as afunction of how densely it was packed, how much salt was dissolvedin it, and so on. We would also need to know something about thelocal temperature variations across the covered area. From thiswe could in principle construct a detailed predictive accountof which areas will remain covered with snow during a melt. Actuallyapplying our theory would be a real challenge. Measuring someof our variables would require destroying the integrity of thesnow pack itself and even then some of the measurements may bedifficult. This is the magnitude of the challenge as many evolutionistssee the problem of applying natural selection to account for distributionand abundance of living forms. Yet a biological account is evenmore challenging. There are no obvious external measurements thatprovide us with fitness values. So even as fitness is supposedto explain future abundance patterns we are constantly faced withmeasuring it in a way that is not just the trivial claim thatfuture patterns are precisely the outcome of relative earlierfitness values.<P>The response to this problem in much evolutionarybiology is to step back from a causal theory and simply definefitness in terms of survival and reproduction-which in our snowanalogy would be to define snow left on the ground in terms of<I>not melting</I>. Biologists have long said a lot about evolutionwithout any detailed knowledge of the steps from genotype to phenotype.All you need are statistical <I>correlations</I> to move fromgene to phenotype without a full causal story. One could pointout that selection has worked in plant and animal breeding. Theparallel in our example would be that snow melts first over heatinggrates and we could arrange heat sources in the ground so thatwe could generate a particular pattern (by overwhelming othervariables). While plant breeding is routine and general claimsin evolutionary biology are possible this in itself does not providewhat we need to explain the actual distribution and abundanceof life at a given time and place, or in Pinker's case <I>particular</I>behavioral dispositions.<P>It is important to distinguish how we study a partof the world from how we believe it to be. There is a differencebetween choosing a particular point of view for exploring a problem(single-gene-based altruism, modular algorithmic brains, etc.)and insisting that this point of view is the only correct description.There may even be good methodological reasons to argue for caricaturein a given instance. One of the things that frustrates non-scientistsabout the practitioners of science is their willing, but fickleembrace of caricature. This methodological stance-simplify untilforced to do something else-is generally justified by pointingto the productivity of a given simplification: it generates testablehypotheses. So while gene-centric adaptationists would agree thattheirs is a gross simplification, they also urge that adaptationismis a powerful explanatory scheme. The same might be said for amodular brain, with each &quot;module&quot; independently optimized.In either case, we can add nuance by including ever more constraintsand connections between &quot;genes&quot; or allowing the modulesto proliferate and interconnect, thus placing epicycles on epicyclesin an attempt to recover actual organisms or brains. In this directionlies a top-heavy and unworkable theory, so we return to the simpletonversion. <P><B>Pinkerworld</B><P>Our final and most serious criticism of Pinker'suse of adaptationism is that the simple theory, in this case,is not even a hypothesis-generating machine: it is just a story-rationalizingmachine. It is not powerful enough to show that a trait is dueto optimization in the face of external pressure. It is especiallyweak when applied to a lineage that does not vary in the traitof interest. If all humans share the language instinct how arewe to uncover the details that lead to this? On the other hand,when faced with abundant variation, the notion of a single optimalsolution is in trouble. These are not just Pinker's problems:all evolutionists face this challenge. If we are going to insiston only using all-traits-are-optimal adaptationism the challengethen becomes how to use the simple model and avoid a self-enchantingreflection of our own prejudices.<P>Pinker may protest that we are demanding too much,that science without simplification stultifies. We might agreeif <I>HTMW</I> did not present its story as the latest scientifictruth. There are many stories we tell ourselves. <I>HTMW</I> presentsone that allows Pinker to hammer current high school pedagogy,explain his affection for lawns over glaciers, and rationalizehis particular view of relationships. Read as autobiography thismay provide some insight, but as storytelling there are certainlymore interesting organizing myths. Pinker's attenuated view ofhumanity is not one we need to adopt and certainly not becausecurrent science demands it.<P>What of the suggestion that science can not makeheadway without simplification? This is where we return to theinteresting methodological question: is it sufficient to focuson an atomized organism (or brain) optimized one gene or moduleat a time? How important are chance and history in the story wetell? Is there anything to attend to in the emergent propertiesof development? In recent conversation, James Crow, our foremostpopulation geneticist, has insisted to us that if there were not<I>some</I> trait independence, evolution would grind to a halt,because any change would change all the traits in an organismand so nothing of lasting substance could be built. There is surelysomething to this. Bird wings and legs do seem to have their ownevolutionary trajectories. But then there is Darwin's notion of&quot;correlation and balance&quot; again. The contingent factthat we have five fingers and five toes may be better explainedby an appeal to how toes and fingers develop than that five isoptimal for their function.<SUP><A HREF = "#13">13</a></SUP> There really is a middle ground here, and most biologists strivefor it.<P>To be sure, without our tools, metaphors, and simplifications,we are overrun. Without them we are left with awe, a canyon thatinvites us to ask only the grandest questions and offers onlyechoes in return. Our response is to embrace the power of toolsto manage the unknown. We should be careful to acknowledge theconstraints that arrive with each metaphor and model, and avoidthe temptation of believing that our theories are somehow indicativeof all that can be. The tools are not the world, though we usethe tools to explore. Darwinian selection has been a marvelousway to organize and interrogate the complicated and interconnected&quot;tangled bank&quot; of nature. We can celebrate this achievement,while rejecting the inversion that places Darwinism at the centerand builds from it a cartoon world of psychological motivationand limp moral theory.<BR><I>HTMW's</I>difficulties remind us of an old proverb: &quot;button a shirtproperly at the bottom, or it won't come out right at the top.&quot;Pinker misses too many of the lower buttons. This is exasperatingin a book of this length. <I>HTMW</I> contains nothing-literallynot one thing-resembling either evolutionary modeling, explicitfitness calculations, or the basics of population or behavioralgenetics. It is a grab bag of assertions that could have beenmade without any appeal to neuroscience, computation, Darwinianpsychology, or genetics. To paraphrase Freeland Judson, thereis a precept here. More is not always more. Indeed it is sometimesdisastrously less. Despite its 600 pages, <I>HTMW</I>'s systematicomission of alternatives and detail creates a burden that readersshould not have to shoulder. <HR noshade><P><P><FONT SIZE=1><A NAME=1>1</A>&nbsp;</FONT> The organizing documentof evolutionary psychology is the 110-page introduction (&quot;ThePsychological Foundations of Culture&quot;) to a much longer collectionof commissioned papers titled <I>The Adapted Mind</I>, editedby Jerome H.

The traditional interpretation is that the light-coloredmoths were sheltered from predators by resting on lichen-encrustedtrees. Peppered moths in Michigan went through similar changes(to a dark form and then back again) at the same time as Britishpopulations without tracking changes in lichen flora. Some ofthe pale forms returned long before the lichen reinvaded. Thereis a correlation with pollution but not with the background colorthat has been traditionally emphasized. It has also not been shownthat moth predators are taking the light forms preferentiallyfrom soot covered trunks, the habitat is quite diverse and themoths spend much of their time in the crowns of trees. So it maybe that saltational shift to darker forms is a response to pollutionnot the result of being more obvious to predators. B. S. Grant,D. F. Owen and C. A.

If this is so, then in the 31 July 1997 issue of<I>Nature</I>, Bruce Devlin, Michael Daniels, and Kathryn Roederonce again found a roughly one-third (34 percent) narrow-senseIQ heritability-with a strong effect due to &quot;maternal environment&quot;(the placental environment) of accounting for about 20 percentof the covariation among twins. Throughout <I>HTMW</I> Pinkerevidently relies on Thomas J. Bouchard's Minnesota twin studies-on25 monozygotic (identical twins. But as the Stanford geneticist Marcus W. Feldman noted to us, Bouchard stillhas not publicly supplied all the data for dizygotic (fraternal)twins raised together and apart so as to properly evaluate thisevidence statistically. Pinker shows little appreciation of thehazards in this literature-e.g., none of the studies even beginto account for such factors as the differences between monozgotictwins sharing the same placenta or not; this cannot generallybe determined after the fact in twin studies, so it is not clearhow to deal with this factor, a matter that Devlin et al. considerat length.<P><FONT SIZE=1><A NAME=8>8</A>&nbsp;</FONT> Specifically, Robert Trivers's &quot;Theevolution of reciprocal altruism,&quot; <I>Quarterly Review ofBiology</I> 46 (1971): 35-57, drew on W. D. Hamilton's classicpopulation genetics analysis that an apparent reduction in personalfitness, an &quot;altruistic behavioral cost&quot; C, can be maintainedunder natural selection if that cost is <I>less</I> than the netgain in the expected number of offspring, a benefit B, producedby that same behavior-say, by aiding your sisters-discounted bya proxy for the fact that your sister won't share exactly allyour genes, the &quot;coefficient of relatedness&quot;, r. Inshort: C&lt;Br, or B/C&gt;1/r. However, Hamilton's original calculationwas done only for <I>haploid-diploid</I> organisms where sistershave only half the usual number of chromosomes; this makes thebookkeeping easy, allowing us to conflate <I>genes</I> and <I>genotypes</I>.Suppose there are two alleles at a single chromosomal locus, a (100 percentdominant) allele, A, for &quot;altruistic&quot;, and a (recessive)allele, a, for selfish. For most organisms-aside from social insects-chromosomescome in pairs, so the possible genotypes become AA (altruistic),Aa (also altruistic, assuming A is 100 percent dominant), andaa (selfish). Social insect sisters are haploid, with half theusual chromosomes, so either all the sisters have allele A, orthey all have a. (In effect, the trait is &quot;sex-linked&quot;.)Then we don't have to worry about genotypes like Aa at all. If,however, we tote up diploid gene frequencies directly, then notonly can we dispense entirely with the problematic notion 'inclusivefitness'-but also, alas, the ratio B/C no longer tells us whethera particular &quot;altruistic&quot; investment strategy can bemaintained under natural selection. The exact size of the benefitmatters-in general, the benefit must be very small-a surprisingresult. And under such conditions natural selection doesn't <I>maximize</I>fitness at all. In this interpretation, the entire kin-selection-maximizefitness edifice collapses. See Luigi L. Cavalli-Sforza and MarcusW. Feldman, &quot;Darwinian Selection and 'Altruism',&quot; <I>TheoreticalPopulation Biology</I> 14 (1978): 268-280.

If you have threealleles, A, S, C in diploid organism (each individual has twoalleles). Assume that the relative fitness of the allele combinationsis as follows; AS is fitter than AA, SS is lethal, CC is fittest,CS is less fit than AA and C is recessive to A. The result ofthese assumptions for a large population, in which there is randommating and all else is equal, is that C is eliminated, so CC isdriven out. This mathematical exercise captures something of whatis thought to happen in the case of Bantu sickle-cell anemia populationgenetics. Pinker mentions the sickle-cell anemia example but doesnot seem to realize its implications for the simple notions of&quot;fitness maximization.&quot;<P><FONT SIZE=1><A NAME=11>11</A>&nbsp;</FONT> A friend who spent eight years in 4-H reminds us that rabbit babies are not actually precocious: "They are little pinkies, just like rats, and don't even open their eyes for days after they've been born.
