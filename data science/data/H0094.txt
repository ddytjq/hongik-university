<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The stories below are flood stories from the world's folklore. I have 
included stories here if (1) they are stories; (2) they are folklore, not 
historical accounts or fiction by a known author; and (3) they involve a flood. 
In most borderline cases, I included the story here anyway. For example, one 
story (Hopi) tells of a flood which was avoided and never occurred. 
<P>My method for collecting these stories is simply to collect every flood story 
I find. I have omitted a few extremely fragmentary accounts, such as sources 
that say "These people have a legend of a flood in which most people were 
killed" and little or nothing more. The stories are summarized both to save 
space and to avoid copyright infringements, but I have attempted to preserve all 
the motifs and all the names that were given in the cited account. However, 
where the story gives intricate account of events before and/or after the flood 
(such as in the Zhuang story of Bubo vs. the Thunder God), some of the details 
peripheral to the flood itself may have been summarized out of existence. In a 
few cases, two or more overlapping and non-contradictory fragments from the same 
culture were combined into one summary. Complete references are given at the 
end; consult them for more details. 
<P>I am sure there are many more flood stories which could be included here. As 
I find them, I will add them. I welcome feedback, especially new flood stories, 
from others.

  <DD>Zeus sent a flood to destroy the men of the Bronze Age. Prometheus advised 
  his son Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few 
  who escaped to high mountains. The mountains in Thessaly were parted, and all 
  the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. Deucalion and 
  his wife Pyrrha (daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora), after floating in the 
  chest for nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. When the rains ceased, he 
  sacrificed to Zeus, the God of Escape. At the bidding of Zeus, he threw stones 
  over his head; they became men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became 
  women. That is why people are called <I>laoi</I>, from <I>laas</I>, "a stone." 
  [Apollodorus 1.7.2] 
  <P>An older version of the story told by Hellanicus has Deucalion's ark 
  landing on Mount Othrys in Thessaly. Another account has him landing on a 
  peak, probably Phouka, in Argolis, later called Nemea. [Gaster, p. 85] 
  <P>The Megarians told that Megarus, son of Zeus, escaped Deucalion's flood by 
  swimming to the top of Mount Gerania, guided by the cries of cranes. [Gaster, 
  p. 85-86] 
  <P>An earlier flood was reported to have occurred in the time of Ogyges, 
  founder and king of Thebes. The flood covered the whole world and was so 
  devastating that the country remained without kings until the reign of 
  Cecrops. [Gaster, p. 87] 
  <P>"Many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years" since 
  Athens and Atlantis were preeminent. Destruction by fire and other 
  catastrophes was also common. In these floods, water rose from below, 
  destroying city dwellers but not mountain people. The floods, especially the 
  third great flood before Deucalion, washed away most of Athens' fertile soil. 
  [Plato, "Timaeus" 22, "Critias" 111-112]

  <DD>Jupiter, angered at the evil ways of humanity, resolved to destroy it. He 
  was about to set the earth to burning, but considered that that might set 
  heaven itself afire, so he decided to flood the earth instead. With Neptune's 
  help, he caused storm and earthquake to flood everything but the summit of 
  Parnassus, where Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha came by boat and found refuge. 
  Recognizing their piety, Jupiter let them live and withdrew the flood. 
  Deucalion and Pyrrha, at the advice of an oracle, repopulated the world by 
  throwing "your mother's bones" (stones) behind them; each stone became a 
  person. [Ovid, book 1] 
  <P>Jupiter and Mercury, traveling incognito in Phrygia, begged for food and 
  shelter, but found all doors closed to them until they received hospitality 
  from Philemon and Baucis. The gods revealed their identity, led the couple up 
  the mountains, and showed them the whole valley flooded, destroying all homes 
  but the couple's, which was transformed into a marble temple. Given a wish, 
  the couple asked to be priest and priestess of the temple, and to die 
  together. In their extreme old age, they changed into an oak and lime tree. 
  [Ovid, book 8]

  <DD>Oden, Vili, and Ve fought and slew the great ice giant Ymir, and icy water 
  from his wounds drowned most of the Rime Giants. The giant Bergelmir escaped, 
  with his wife and children, on a boat. Ymir's body became the world we live 
  on. [Sturluson, p. 35]

  <DD>Heaven and Earth were great giants, and Heaven lay upon the Earth so that 
  their children were crowded between them, and the children and their mother 
  were unhappy in the darkness. The boldest of the sons led his brothers in 
  cutting up Heaven into many pieces. From his skull they made the firmament. 
  His spilling blood caused a great flood which killed all humans except a

  tallest mountain, where some people and animals had sought refuge. Everybody 
  climbed in and survived the flood floating in the nutshell. God's wrath

  highest mountains were covered. The waters flooded the earth for 150 days; 
  then God sent a wind and the waters receded, and the ark came to rest in 
  Ararat. After 40 days, Noah sent out a raven, which kept flying until the 
  waters had dried up. He next sent out a dove, which returned without finding a 
  perch. A week later he set out the dove again, and it returned with an olive 
  leaf. The next week, the dove didn't return. After a year and 10 days from the

  <DD>The Supreme Sovereign ordered the water god Gong Gong to create a flood as 
  punishment and warning for human misbehavior. Gong Gong extended the flood for 
  22 years, and people had to live in high mountain caves and in trees, fighting 
  with wild animals for scarce resources. Unable to persuade the Supreme 
  Sovereign to stop the flood, and told by an owl and a turkey about _Xirang_ or 
  Growing Soil, the supernatural hero Gun stole Growing Soil from heaven to dam 
  the waters. Before Gun was finished, however, the Supreme Sovereign sent the 
  fire god Zhu Rong to execute him for his theft. The Growing Soil was taken 
  back to heaven, and the floods continued. However, Gun's body didn't decay, 
  and when it was cut apart three years later, his son Yu emerged in the form of 
  a horned dragon. Gun's body also transformed into a dragon at that time and 
  thenceforth lived quietly in the deeps. The Supreme Sovereign was fearful of 
  Yu's power, so he cooperated and gave Yu the Growing Soil and the use of the 
  dragon Ying. Yu led other gods to drive away Gong Gong, distributed the 
  Growing Soil to remove most of the flood, and led the people to fashion rivers 
  from Ying's tracks and thus channel the remaining floodwaters to the sea.

  <DD>Thunder God demanded half of Bubo's crops, but Bubo tricked him into 
  taking the tops of taro and the roots of rice. Thunder God retaliated by 
  withdrawing rain from the earth. Bubo led his people to open the copper sluice 
  gate of the heavenly river a crack, but Thunder God closed it tight and lifted 
  heaven higher so the people couldn't come again. Bubo went to the Dragon King 
  to demand water of him. Dragon King refused, but he was forced to release his 
  stream when Bubo held him tight and the people plucked out almost all his 
  beard. By the third year, this stream dried up. Bubo climbed the sun-moon tree 
  on Mount Bachi to heaven to fight Thunder God. Qigao, one of the thunder 
  soldiers, told Bubo that Thunder God was determined to kill people with 
  drought and pointed out his location. Bubo caught him and made him promise to 
  send rain in three days, but Thunder God went back on his promise. Qigao 
  brought world that Thunder God was grinding his axe. Bubo put a slippery 
  surface on his roof and instructed his wife and children to stand ready with 
  clubs and a net. Thunder God came in a rainstorm and tried to land on Bubo's 
  house but slipped off and was captured. Bubo imprisoned Thunder God in a 
  granary, warning his family not to give him an ax or any water, but his 
  children, Fuyi and his sister, were enticed to give him some indigo ink, and 
  the moisture gave Thunder God the strength to escape. The children were angry 
  that he had tricked them, but Thunder God promised that he would repay them by 
  saving them from the flood that he would bring in a few days. He gave them one 
  of his teeth and told them to plant it. They did so, and it grew into a vine 
  with a giant gourd fruit. Fuyi and his sister scooped out the pith and entered 
  it. Thunder God breached the dike holding back the river of heaven, and Dragon 
  King, in revenge against Bubo's plucking his beard, released his lake water, 
  too. The water rose over the mountains as high as heaven's ceiling. Bubo, 
  though, rode the waves floating on an inverted umbrella. He made for the gate 
  of heaven and attacked Thunder God, chopping off his feet. (Thunder God later 
  replaced them with chicken feet.) Thunder God, with the help of Dragon King, 
  rapidly made the water subside so Bubo could not reach him. Bubo and his 
  umbrella dropped from the sky and were smashed. Bubo's heart was thrown onto 
  the ceiling of heaven and remains there as the planet Venus. Fuyi and his 
  sister landed safely in the soft gourd. They wandered the earth but found 
  nobody else. They came across a turtle which said the two of them should 
  marry. Fuyi and his sister said, "How can a brother and sister marry?" and 
  said if the turtle can come back to life after they beat it death, they would 
  marry. They beat it to death, whereupon it laughed and crawled away. A bamboo 
  also told them to marry; they cut it down, and it came back to life and 
  laughed as they left. Venus spoke to them, told them to build fires on two 
  different mountains, and if the smoke columns joined, they could marry. They 
  did so, the smoke columns came together, Venus laughed, and the brother and 
  sister married. They gave birth to a fleshball. Not knowing what to do with 
  it, they minced it up and scattered the pieces, and the pieces became men and 
  women. Qigao became a worm, which Thunder God attacks when he comes to the

  <DD>After death came into the world as a result of a macaque's curse, sky and 
  earth longed for human souls and bones. That is how the flood began. An 
  orphaned brother and sister lived in squalor in a village. A pair of golden 
  birds flew down to them one day, warned them that a huge wave would flood the 
  earth, and told them to take shelter in a gourd and not to come out until they 
  heard the birds again. The two children warned their neighbors, but the people 
  didn't believe them. The children sawed off the top of a gourd and went 
  inside. For ninety-nine days, there was no wind or rain, and the earth became 
  parched. Then torrents of rain fell, and the resulting flood washed everything 
  away. The brother and sister occasionally could hear the gourd bump against 
  the bottom of heaven. After long waiting, they heard the birds calling, left 
  the gourd, and found they had landed atop a mountain, and the flood had 
  receded. But now there were nine suns and seven moons in the sky, and they 
  scorched the earth during the day. The two golden birds returned with a golden 
  hammer and silver tongs and instructed the children how to use them to get the 
  dragon king's bow and arrows. Brother and sister went to the dragon pond and 
  struck the reef-home of the dragon king with the hammer. This raised such a 
  racket that the dragon king sent his servants (various fish) to investigate. 
  The children grabbed the fish with the tongs and threw them on the bank. At 
  last, the dragon king himself came to investigate and had to give his bow and 
  arrows when he was likewise caught. With these, brother and sister shot down 
  all but the brightest sun and moon. Brother and sister then went in search of 
  other people, exploring north and south respectively. They found nobody else, 
  and the golden birds appeared again and urged them to marry. They refused, but 
  the birds told them it was the will of heaven. After divinations in the form 
  of several improbable events (tortoise shells landing a certain way, a broken 
  millstone came together, and the brother shooting an arrow through a needle's 
  eye--all happening three times), they consented. They had six sons and six 
  daughters which traveled different directions and became the ancestors of 
  different races. [L. Miller, pp. 78-84]

  followed it as he picked bamboo shoots. He saw an eagle clutch a tiny red 
  snake. In pity for the snake, Xiang yelled and threw his basket at the eagle, 
  which dropped the snake and flew away. Xiang saw the snake disappear in a 
  flash of light, and a column of smoke drifted up the mountain. That night he 
  dreamed that a golden dragon thanked him for saving the life of the dragon's 
  daughter and told him to visit. Grandma Ya had the same dream, so they set 
  out, with their grandchildren, across three mountain passes and up a long 
  slope, as the dream had directed. A beautiful girl came and told them that she 
  had gone out earlier, entranced by the rainbow, and Xiang had rescued her. She 
  led them to an idyllic pond and invited them to settle there. They did, and 
  they grew younger and stronger from eating the fish of the pool. After a year, 
  Xiang went back to his village and invited the people to live up on Sun 
  Mountain with him. They did so and lived happily for some time. But an evil 
  man wasted fish, polluted the pond, and finally poisoned all the fish. One 
  dying fish told Xiang to make it a corn-flour body, feed it for 81 days on 
  dew, and make a wooden house for himself. He did so, and all the people except 
  the evil man made wooden houses. After 81 days, a fierce gale came, while the 
  sky darkened and lightning flashed. The fish shook itself and turned into a 
  girl and then into the red snake, which flew off to join the golden dragon 
  Xiang had seen in his dreams. It told him to take his things into his wooden 
  house and stay there. Pelting rain then fell from the sky, and soon there was 
  a vast flood. The evil man was helpless in his stone house, but the wooden 
  houses of the others floated. The golden dragon shook his body, and the upper 
  half of Sun Mountain erupted into the sky. The body of the evil man was buried 
  by the falling stones. The others floated peacefully down the mountain and 
  carved a giant stone fish where they settled. This statue and the lower part

  sister, felled a big tree, hollowed it out, and covered both ends with 
  cowhide. They attached brass bells to the outside, and inside they put grain 
  and seed, the two children, and a knife and cake of beeswax. They instructed 
  the children not to come out until the flood had gone down. The flood came, 
  and the children floated for an undeterminable period. Mahei got impatient and 
  cut a small hole with the knife. He saw muddy waves surging and dead bodies 
  everywhere, and he closed the hole with wax. Later, Maniu cut a hole and saw 
  nothing but water; she likewise filled the hole. Finally, they heard the bells 
  ringing, indicating they had touched ground, and they left the drum. They were 
  the only survivors. When they got old, they realized that there would be no 
  people left if they died. Mahei suggested marriage, but his sister was ashamed 
  to marry her brother. Mahei suggested she consult the magic tree. Maniu went 
  there, but Mahei took a shortcut and hid behind the tree. Disguising his 
  voice, he answered Maniu that she should marry her brother. They did so, but 
  by then they were too old to have children. The sole gourd seed they had 
  carried in the wooden drum had grown profusely, and although most of the 
  fruits dried and rotted, one stayed ripe. They had hung it in their shed. One 
  day, they heard faint voices coming from the gourd. They heated their fire 
  tongs red hot to burn a hole in the gourd, but each time they tried, a voice 
  said "Don't burn me!" Finally, one voice, calling herself Grandma Apierer, 
  said to burn her or none could get out. They burnt a hole in the navel on the 
  gourd's bottom. First out was Apo, ancestor of the Konge people; his skin was 
  darkened by the soot around the hole. The next out, in order, were Han, Dai, 
  and last of all Jino (which literally means "last squeeze"); they became 
  ancestors of their people. Since then, rice offerings have been made to 
  Apierer, who gave her life so that the Jino might live. [L. Miller, pp. 68-73]

  when the boy was seven years old. One day, rains came and lasted for many 
  months, flooding the earth with a raging sea. The laurel, in danger of 
  falling, told his son to ride him when it came uprooted by the waves. The boy 
  did so, floating on the tree for many days. One day a crowd of ants floated by 
  and cried out to be saved. After asking the tree for permission, the boy gave 
  them refuge on the branches of the laurel. Later, a group of mosquitoes flew 
  by and also asked to be saved. Again, the boy asked the tree for permission, 
  was granted it, and gave the mosquitoes rest. Then another boy floated by and 
  asked to be saved. This time the tree refused permission when its son asked. 
  The son asked twice more, and after the third time the tree said, "Do what you 
  like," and the son rescued the other boy. At last the tree came to rest on the 
  summit of a mountain. The insects expressed their gratitude and left. The two 
  boys, being very hungry, went and found a house where an old woman lived with 
  her own daughter and a foster-daughter. As everyone else in the world had 
  perished and the subsiding waters allowed farming again, the woman decided to 
  marry her daughters to the boys, her own going to the cleverer boy. The second 
  boy maliciously told the woman that the other boy could quickly gather millet 
  grains scattered on sand. The woman tested this claim, and the first boy 
  despaired of ever succeeding, when the ants came to his aid, filling the grain 
  bag in a few minutes. The other boy had watched, and he told the woman that 
  the task hadn't been done by the first boy himself, so the woman still 
  couldn't decide which daughter to marry to which boy. She decided to let the 
  boys decide by chance, going to one room or another in total darkness. A 
  mosquito came and told the Son of the Tree which room the old woman's daughter 
  was in, so those two were married, and the second boy married the 
  foster-daughter. The human race is descended from those two couples. [Zong,

  face belching fire at the castle, a genii studying astrology, a rat whose 
  swinging tail produced a flood which threatened the castle, and a giant who 
  hurled flames at the King's camp. Gim fought them with his magic but was 
  overwhelmed by their numbers. He fled with the king to an island, but the rat 
  tried to submerge it with an even greater flood from its tail. A butterfly led 
  Gim to a cavern in a distant mountain, where he met the first boy he had 
  encountered. They went back to fight together, but the other boy was killed 
  and the island submerged, and Gim and the King retreated to a second island. 
  Gim was led by a crow to another cavern in the mountains where he met his 
  other friend. They returned to fight, but again the friend was killed, the 
  island submerged, and Gim and the King had to retreat. When a third island was

  four sons were tigers in disguise. The tigers tried to kill them by roasting 
  the room, but Nose-wind kept it cool by his blowing. The next day, the woman 
  challenged them to a contest of gathering pine trees while her sons stacked 
  them. When it became clear that the four brothers ripped up the trees faster 
  than the tigers could stack them, the woman set fire to the logs. Waterfall, 
  though, made water which not only put out the fire, but created a flood that 
  nearly drowned the tigers. Nose-wind blew on the water and froze it. 
  Iron-shoes skated out and kicked the heads off the tigers, and Long-rake broke 
  up the ice and threw it far and wide, eliminating any trace of the flood.

  great spring gushed forth rapidly enough to kill many of the diggers. While 
  the Ifugaos celebrated the waters, a storm came, the river kept rising, and 
  the elders advised people to run for the mountains, as the river gods were 
  angry. Only two people made it to safety, a brother and sister, Wigan and 
  Bugan, on the separate mountains Amuyao and Kalawitan. Both had enough food on 
  the summits, but only Bugan had fire. After six months, the waters receded. 
  Wigan traveled to his sister on Mt. Kalawitan, and they settled in the valley. 
  The sister later found herself with child and ran away in shame, following the

  While they were frying the pieces, strange noises came from the frying pan and 
  a torrential rain began. The rain continued until only the highest hill

  a creeper warmed by the rubbing between the creeper and a tree in the wind. 
  She took the hint, rubbed the creeper against a piece of wood, and produced 
  fire for the first time. The woman took the fire-drill for her mate and gave 
  birth to a son called Simpang-impang. He was only half a man, with only one

  make their way there, but nearly all life was destroyed in the great flood. 
  When the flood ended and the sun shone again, the kangaroo called animals 
  together to discover how the platypus family had fared. But they could not 
  find a single living platypus. Three years later, the cormorant told emu that 
  he had seen a platypus beak impression along a river, but never saw a 
  platypus. Because of the flood, the platypuses had decided that the animals, 
  birds, and reptiles were their enemies and only moved about at night. The 
  animals organized a search party, and carpet-snake eventually found a platypus 
  home and reported its location back to the others. Kangaroo summoned all the 
  tribes together, even the insect tribe. Fringed lizard was ejected for doing 
  mischief; he has turned ugly because of the hate he dwells upon. The animals 
  and birds found they were both related to the platypus family; even the 
  reptiles found some relationship; and everyone agreed that the platypuses were 
  an old race. Carpet-snake went to the platypus home and invited them to the 
  assembly. They came and were met with great respect. Kangaroo offered platypus 
  his choice of the daughter of any of them. Platypus learned that emu had 
  changed its totem so that the platypus and emu families could marry. This made 
  platypus decide it didn't want to be part of any of their families. Emu got 
  angry, and kangaroo suggested the platypuses leave silently that night, which 
  they did. They met bandicoot along the way, who invited the platypuses to live 
  with them. The platypuses married the bandicoot daughters and lived happily. 
  Water-rats got jealous and fought them but were defeated. Platypuses have 
  tried to be seperate from the animal and bird tribes ever since, but not 
  entirely successfully. [W. R. Smith, pp. 151-168]

  <DT><A name=Maori>Maori (New Zealand):</A> 
  <DD>Long ago, there were a great many different tribes, and they quarrelled 
  and made war on each other. The worship of Tane, the creator, was being 
  neglected and his doctrines denied. Two prophets, Para-whenua-mea and 
  Tupu-nui-a-uta, taught the true doctrine about the separation of heaven and 
  earth, but others just mocked them, and they became angry. So they built a 
  large raft at the source of the Tohinga River, built a house on it, and 
  provisioned it with fern-root, sweet potatoes, and dogs. Then they prayed for 
  abundant rain to convince men of the power of Tane. Two men named Tiu and 
  Reti, a woman named Wai-puna-hau, and other women also boarded the raft. Tiu 
  was the priest on the raft, and he recited the prayers and incantations for 
  rain. It rained hard for four or five days, until Tiu prayed for the rain to 
  stop. But though the rain stopped, the waters still rose and bore the raft 
  down the Tohinga river and onto the sea. In the eighth month, the waters began 
  to thin; Tiu knew this by the signs of his staff. At last they landed at 
  Hawaiki. The earth had been much changed by the flood, and the people on the 
  raft were the only survivors. They worshipped Tane, Rangi (Heaven), Rehua, and 
  all the gods, each at a separate alter. After making fire by friction, they 
  made thanks-offerings of seaweed for their rescue. Today, only the chief 
  priest may go to those holy spots. [Gaster, pp. 110-112; Kelsen, p. 133] 
  <P>Two brothers-in-law of the hero Tawhaki attacked him and left him for dead. 
  He recovered, and retired with his own warriors and their families to a high 
  mountain, where he built a fortified village. Then he called to the gods, his 
  ancestors, for revenge. The floods of heaven descended and killed everyone on 
  earth. This event was called "The overwhelming of the Mataaho." [Gaster, p. 
  112] 
  <P>In another version of the story, Tawhaki, a man, put on a garment of 
  lightning and was worshipped as a god. Once, in a fit of anger, he stamped on 
  the floor of heaven, breaking it and releasing the celestial waters which 
  flooded the earth. [Gaster, p. 112]

  <DD>The stars are the shining eyes of the gods. A man once went into the sky 
  and stole one of the eyes. (The Pelew Islanders' money is made from it.) The 
  gods were angry at this and came to earth to punish the theft. They disguised 
  themselves as ordinary men and went door-to-door begging for food and lodging. 
  Only one old woman received them kindly. They told her to make a bamboo raft 
  ready and, on the night of the next full moon, to lie down on it and sleep. 
  This she did. A great storm came; the sea rose, flooded the islands, and 
  destroyed everyone else. The woman, fast asleep, drifted until her hair caught 
  on a tree on the top of Mount Armlimui. The gods came looking for her again 
  after the flood ebbed, but they found her dead. So one of the women-folk from 
  heaven entered the body and restored it to life. The gods begat five children 
  by the old woman and then returned to heaven, as did the goddess who restored 
  her to life. The present inhabitants of the islands are descendants of those 
  five children. [Gaster, pp. 112-113] 
  <P>Before humans, one of the Kaliths (deities) named Athndokl visited an 
  unfriendly village and was killed by its inhabitants. Seven friendly gods, who 
  went searching for him, were met with unkindness except from the woman 
  Milathk, who told them of the death. They resolved vengeance by flooding the 
  village, and suggested Milathk save herself by preparing a raft tied to a tree 
  by a rope. The flood came and covered the village at the next full moon. 
  Milathk perished in the flood, but was recalled to life by the oldest Obakad 
  god. He wanted to make her immortal but was stopped by another god, Tariit. 
  Milathk became the mother of mankind. [Kelsen, p. 132]

  <DD>Naareau the Elder created the earth, but the sky and the earth clove 
  together with darkeness between them, for there was no separation. Naareau the 
  Younger, walking on the overside of the sky, decided to go between, and with a 
  spell, created a slight cleft; he tapped on the sky three times, and on the 
  third tap it opened. He heard breathing within, created the First Creature, a 
  bat, by rubbing his fingers together, and told it to look around. The Bat 
  reported finding a Company of Fools and Deaf Mutes. At Naareau's direction, 
  the Bat landed on their foreheads and told Naareau their names. Naareau 
  crawled in the cleft and, with the Bat as his guide, went to the people. 
  Naareau told them to push up, and the sky was lifted a little, but they could 
  lift it only so high since the sky was rooted to the land. Naareau sent 
  Naabawe, one of the people, to summon Riiki, the conger eel. Riiki was 
  sleeping and bit Naabawe when he was called. Naareau made a slip-noose and 
  took two of Octopus's ten legs for bait (which is why octopuses have only 
  eight legs today). With these, Naareau caught Riiki and told it to push up on 
  the sky against the land. While Riiki pushed, Great Ray, Turtle, and Octopus 
  tore at the roots of the sky while Naareau sang. The Company of Fools and Deaf 
  Mutes stood by laughing. The roots of the sky were torn loose. The sky was 
  pushed high and the land sank. But the sky had no sides, so Naareau sang and 
  pulled down its sides so it was shaped like a bowl. The Company of Fools and 
  Deaf Mutes were left swimming in the sea; they became the sea creatures. [von

  great flood. This was the origin of the sea. [Roheim, p. 152] 
  <P>The legendary hero Qat made a great canoe out of one of the largest trees

  his brothers jeered at him for building a canoe so far from the sea. When the 
  canoe was finished, he gathered into his canoe his family and some of all the 
  living creatures, down to the smallest ant, and he fastened a cover over it. A 
  great deluge of rain came; the hollow in the center of the island filled with 
  water which broke through the hills where a great waterfall still descends. 
  The water carried the canoe out to sea and out of sight. The natives say Qat 
  took the best of everything with him and look forward to his return. [Gaster,

  search proved fruitless, but a second search exposed the grandsons' guilt. 
  Rather than apologizing, they fled to the mountains and took refuge with some 
  carpenters, who built a strong stockade to keep Ndengei at bay. In their 
  fortress, the rebels withstood Ndengei's armies for three months, but then 
  Ndengei caused the earth to be flooded with rain. The rebels sat securely as 
  the surrounding lands were submerged, until the waters reached their walls. 
  They prayed to another god for direction, and they were brought canoes (or 
  taught how to make them) by Rokoro, the god of carpenters, and his foreman 
  Rokola. (By other accounts, they were instructed to make floats out of the 
  shaddock fruit, or they floated in bowls.) They floated around picking up 
  other survivors. The receding tide left a total of eight survivors on the

  surfaced, upbraided the fisherman, and threatened to destroy the land in 
  revenge. The fisherman prostrated himself and apologized profusely. Moved by 
  his penitence, Ruahatu told him to go with his wife and child to Toamarama, a 
  small low island (not more than two feet above sea level) in a lagoon on the 
  east side of Raiatea. This he did, taking also some domesticated animals. As 
  the sun set, the ocean waters began to rise and continued rising all night.

  The husband said they should escape to Mount Orofena, but the wife said 
  (correctly) that the flood would reach even there, and they should go to Mount 
  Pita-hiti instead, which they did. They watched ten nights till the sea ebbed. 
  The land, though, remained without produce, and the fish in the rock crevices 
  were putrid. When the wind died away, stones and trees began to fall from the 
  heavens, where the winds had carried them. To escape this new danger, the 
  couple dug a hole, lined it with grass, and covered it over with stones and 
  earth. They crept inside and listened to the terrible crash of the falling 
  stones. By and by, the falling stones stopped, but to be safe they waited 
  another night before coming out. The land they found was desolated. The woman 
  brought forth two children, a son and a daughter, but grieved about the lack 
  of food. Again the mother brought forth, but still there was no food. Then in 
  three days all the trees bore fruit. All people are descended from that

  brothers, the <I>pao'o</I> fish, may search for her. At her suggestion, they 
  fled to the mountains and built their home in the tops of the tallest trees. 
  After ten days, Kahinalii sent the ocean; it rose and overwhelmed the land. 
  The people fled to the mountains, and the flood covered the mountains; they 
  climbed the trees, and the flood rose above the trees and drowned them all. 
  But the waters began to subside just as they reached the door of Konikonia's 
  house. When the waters retreated, he and his people returned to their land. 
  This flood is called kai-a-ka-hina-lii. [Barrère, p. 23]

  ground, leaving only a few mountains not entirely submerged. She later caused 
  it to recede to what we see today. This sea was named after the mother of

  contained a number of things, and Nu'u ruled over the whole like a chief. 
  After the flood, these people repopulated the islands. The waters came up as a 
  wicked brother-in-law of Nu'u was indulging himself in pleasure. He ran to 
  enter the ark, but his calls were unheard by those inside. He prayed to the 
  god Lono in the name of his sister but did not escape. He became angry at the 
  first pair of people who had brought this trouble by bringing evil into the 
  world, and he prayed to Lono that the whole earth be destroyed and that the 
  first pair of people be brought back to life to witness the trouble they 
  caused. [Barrère, pp. 19-21] 
  <P>Nuu was of the thirteenth generation from the first man. The gods commanded 
  Nuu to build an ark and carry on it his wife, three sons, and males and 
  females of all breathing things. Waters came and covered the earth. They 
  subsided to leave the ark on a mountain overlooking a beautiful valley. The 
  gods entered the ark and told Nuu to go forth with all the life it carried. In 
  gratitude for his deliverance, Nuu offered a sacrifice of pig, coconuts, and 
  awa to the moon, which he thought was the god Kane. Kane descended on a 
  rainbow to reproach Nuu for his mistake but left the rainbow as a perpetual 
  sign of his forgiveness. [Kalakaua, p. 37; Barrère, pp. 21-22]

  trees and drowning all people but the Wise Man and his family on his raft. As 
  he floated, he gathered pairs of all animals and birds he met with. The earth 
  disappeared under the waters, and for a long time no one thought to look for

  couldn't find it. He dived a second time and smelled the earth but didn't 
  reach it. Next beaver dived. He reappeared unconscious but holding a little 
  mud. The Wise Man placed the mud on the water and breathed on it, making it 
  grow. He continued breathing on it, making it larger and larger. He put a fox 
  on the island, but it ran around the island in just a day. Six times the fox 
  ran around the island, by the seventh time, the land was as large as it was

  wife (who was also his sister) and son. They repeopled the land. But the flood 
  waters were still too high, and to lower them, the bittern swallowed them all. 
  Now there was too little water. Plover, pretending sympathy at the bittern's

  He was told to go to a lake (Lake Campbell) and swim and fast to get his 
  spirit powers, but he delayed. Finally he did so after his family deserted

  his blanket over the water and the forest and name the four names of the 
  earth; this created food for everyone. Next, at the direction of the Old 
  Creator, he gathered the bones of the people who lived before the flood, waved 
  the blanket over them and named the four names, and made people again. These 
  people couldn't talk, so he similarly made brains for them from the soil. Then

  dog, which survived atop Tacobud (Mt. Ranier). From them the next race of

  matters worse, a huge and powerful bear came from the south. It had the power 
  to paralyze with its gaze whatever it wanted to eat, and it threatened to eat 
  all the people. The Changer sent a Spirit Man from the east to teach them 
  civilization. He showed them how to make and use bows, canoes, clothing, fire, 
  etc., and taught them about the spirits and the potlatch custom. He killed the

  <DD>In the beginning, there was no land, and Xowalaci (The Giver) and his 
  companion lived in a sweat house on the water. One day, white land appeared 
  and expanded on the waters. Xowalaci made it solid by blowing tobacco smoke on 
  it. He made more solid land by dropping five mud cakes into the ocean and 
  telling them to expand when they hit the bottom. When he stepped on the new 
  land, it became solid. He looked on the sand of the new land and saw a man's 
  tracks, seemingly coming from the north and leading into the water to the 
  south. This worried him, and he told the water to overflow the land he had 
  created from the mud and to recede again. But he found more tracks again, 
  coming from the west, so he caused a second flood. He repeated the process 
  five times with no different results. Finally he gave up and said, "This is 
  going to make trouble in the future!" and there has been trouble in the world 
  since then. Then Xowalaci tried to make people. He formed figures from grass 
  and mud, ordered a house to appear, and gave the figures to his companion to 
  put in the house. Dogs arose from this creation attempt. He tried again using 
  white sand, but those figures gave rise to snakes. He attributed these 
  failures to the footprints. The world became inhabited by dogs and snakes. He 
  crushed the ten biggest snakes in baskets of mixed fresh and salt water and 
  threw them in the ocean. Two bad snakes got away to give rise to today's 
  snake-like animals. Xowalaci ordered those two to encircle the world and hold 
  it together. He also crushed five bad dogs and threw them in a ditch. They 
  gave rise to water monsters. Soon after, his companion smoked for three days 
  and created a house from which a woman emerged. Xowalaci told his companion to 
  be her husband. Xowalaci straightened out the world, made more animals, and 
  went up into the sky, saying as he went that the companion, his wife, and 
  their sixteen children would speak different languages and become progenitors 
  of the different tribes. [Sproul, pp. 232-236; von Franz, p. 174]

  many ducks and geese. His grandfather Olle, Coyote-man, taught him how to make 
  and use a sling. Wekwek went back to the area, killed hundreds of birds, 
  gathered them, and brought them back to Olle. The next day, Wekwek saw Sahte, 
  Weasel-man, coming and going and was curious about him. Wekwek followed Sahte 
  north to Clear Lake and found his home while Sahte was out. He found several 
  sacks of shell-bead money there and took it all back with him. When Sahte 
  returned, he wanted to find out who stole his money. He set fire to one end of 
  a stick and pointed it in different directions. When it pointed south towards 
  the thief, the flame leaped from the stick and spread southward. Wekwek was 
  concerned when he saw that the country to the north was on fire, and he told 
  Olle. Olle knew the reason for the fire, but he said only, "The people up 
  there are burning tules." When the fire came close so that Wekwek thought they 
  would soon burn, he confessed to Olle that he had stolen the money and hidden 
  it in the creek. Olle then took a sack from his roundhouse and beat it against 
  an oak tree, creating fog. He beat another sack against the tree, causing more 
  fog, and then rain. He said the rain would last for ten days and nights. The 
  rain covered all the land except the top of Mount Konokti. Wekwek flew around 
  in the rain and eventually found that refuge. On the tenth day, the rain 
  stopped, and the water started going down. After about a week, the land was 
  bare again. At that time, there were no real people in the world. Olle took 
  the feathers of the geese that Wekwek had killed at Wennok lake. They traveled 
  over the country, and whenever they found a good site, Olle laid two feathers 
  side by side. The next morning, each pair of feathers had turned into a man 
  and a woman. Later, Wekwek commented to Olle that the people had no fire, and 
  Olle sent Wekewillah, the Shrew-mice brothers, to steal fire from Kahkahte, 
  the Crow, who had it at his roundhouse. They succeeded, and Olle put the fire

  Badger hid Manabush in the earth, so the Ana maqkiu gave up the search just as

  waters still rose. He called to Kisha Manido for help, who commanded the

  <DD>In the world before this one, the people didn't know how to behave or how 
  to act human, and the creating power was displeased. He placed three dry 
  buffalo chips under a sacred pipe rack and saved a fourth for lighting the 
  pipe. He sang three songs to bring rain, which caused the rivers to overflow; 
  then he sang a fourth song and stamped on the earth. The earth split open, and 
  water flowed from the cracks and covered everything. The Creating Power 
  floated on the sacred pipe and his huge pipe bag. All people and animals were 
  destroyed except Kangi, the crow. It was very tired and three times asked the 
  Creating Power to make a place for it to rest. The Creating Power opened his 
  pipe bag, which contained all manner of animals and birds, and selected four 
  known for their diving abilities. He sang a song and commanded the loon to 
  dive and bring up mud, but the loon failed. Likewise, the water was too deep 
  for otter and beaver. But the turtle succeeded in bringing up a little mud. 
  The Creating Power took the mud and, singing, spread it out on the water. 
  After the fourth song, there was enough land for himself and the crow. He 
  waved two long eagle feathers over the ground, and it spread until it replaced 
  the water. He named it the Turtle Continent. The Creating Power thought, "Land 
  without water is not good," and wept for the earth and the creatures he would 
  put upon it. His tears became oceans, streams, and lakes. He scattered the 
  animals across the land; they came to life when he stamped on the ground. He 
  created four colors of people from red, white, black, and yellow earth. He 
  created the rainbow as a sign that there would be no more great flood. But 
  warned that he had destroyed the first world by fire because it was bad, and 
  the second world by flood, and he would destroy this world too if people make 
  it bad and ugly. [Erdoes &amp; Ortiz, pp. 496-499] 
  <P>Unktehi, a water monster, fought the people and caused a great flood. The 
  people retreated to a hill, but the water swept over them, killing them all. 
  The blood gelled and turned to pipestone. (Pipes made from that rock are 
  sacred today.) Unktehi was also turned to stone; her bones are in the Badlands 
  now, forming a long ridge. A giant eagle, Wanblee Galeshka, swept down, saved 
  one girl from the flood, carrying her to a tree on the highest pinnacle, the 
  only place not covered by water. He made her his wife. She bore twins, a boy 
  and a girl, which are the ancestors of the Sioux. [Erdoes &amp; Ortiz, pp. 
  93-95] 
  <P>Unktehi puffed up her body to make the Missouri overflow, and the little 
  water monsters, her children, did the same with other streams and lakes. This 
  caused a great flood which covered the country. Only a few people escaped to 
  the highest mountain, and the waves threatened to kill them. The thunderbirds 
  liked people, so they fought the water monsters for several years. In time, it 
  became clear that the thunderbirds were losing when they fought close, so they 
  retreated to the sky and, all together, sent their lightning bolts. This 
  burned the forests, boiled the water, and turned the earth red hot, except 
  where the people had taken refuge. Unktehi and the water monsters were 
  defeated. Their bones can still be seen in the Badlands. [Erdoes &amp; Ortiz,

  think of the animals as their brothers. The Great Spirit was sad and let the 
  people's smoke from their fires lie in the valleys. The people coughed and 
  choked but continued their evil ways. The Great Spirit sent rains to 
  extinguish the fires and destroy the people. The people moved to the hills as 
  the waters rose. Spotted Bear, the medicine man, said they would be safe as 
  long as they had buffalo, but there were no buffalo around. The young men went 
  hunting for buffalo, revising their treatment of nature as they went. The 
  waters rose, and people climbed to the mountains. Finally, two men came back 
  with the hide of a white bull buffalo which had tried to climb to the 
  mountains but had drowned in the floodwaters, though a cow and young buffalo 
  survived. Spotted Bear announced that, since the people were no longer 
  destroying the world, that buffalo would save those who were left. With help 
  from other medicine men, he scraped and stretched the hide, stretching it over 
  the whole village. Each day the wet hide stretched farther, until it covered 
  all of Yellowstone Valley. Rain no longer fell in the valley, and people and 
  animals moved back there. The hide began to sag, but Spotted Bear raised the 
  west end to catch the West Wind, which made the skin a dome over the valley. 
  The Great Spirit, seeing that people were living at peace with the earth, 
  stopped the rain. The sun shone on the hide, shrinking it until all that was 
  left was a rainbow arch. [Edmonds &amp; Clark, pp. 17-19]

  <DD>A woman gave birth to four monsters. Though advised to kill them, she let 
  them grow. They grew quickly and acted evilly, and before long they were too 
  large and powerful to kill. They kept growing. One night they came together in 
  the camp with their backs together and grew together into one creature, which 
  grew tall enough to touch the sky. Most people took refuge at their base, 
  where they couldn't bend over and reach them; others were caught by the 
  monsters' long arms and eaten. One man who could see the future heard a voice 
  telling him to plant a hollow reed. He did so, and it quickly grew very big. 
  The voice directed the man and his wife to go naked into the reed, taking 
  pairs of good animals, when they see all the birds of the world flying south. 
  The sign came and they entered. Rain came, and waters rose to cover everything 
  but the top of the reed and the heads of the monsters. Turtle destroyed the 
  monsters by digging under them and uprooting them. They broke apart and fell 
  in (and thus formed) the four cardinal directions. The waters subsided, and 
  winds dried the earth. The people and animals emerged onto a barren earth, and 
  the wife wondered how they would live. The man said, "Go to sleep." Four times 
  they slept, and each time they woke there was more growth around them. After 
  the fourth night, they awoke in a grass hut, and there was a stalk of corn 
  outside. The voice told them corn was to be their holy food. If they plant 
  corn and something else comes up, then the world will end. The voice didn't 
  return after that. [Erdoes &amp; Ortiz, p. 120-122]

  expelled them by sending a wall of water from all directions. The Insect 
  People flew up into the second world, guided through a hole in the sky by a 
  cliff swallow. The second world was a barren world inhabited by Swallow 
  People. They decided to stay anyway, but after 24 days, one of the Insect 
  People made love to the wife of the Swallow People's chief. They were expelled 
  to the third world; the white face of the wind told them of an opening. The 
  third world was a barren world of Grasshopper People. Again, the Insect People 
  were expelled for philandering after 24 days. The red face of the wind guided 
  them to the hole to the fourth world. This world was inhabited by animals and 
  Pueblos, with whom the Insect People coexisted peacefully. The gods made 
  people in human form from ears of corn, different colors of corn becoming 
  different tribes. The Insect People intermarried with them, and their 
  descendants eventually looked fully human. In time, the men and women argued 
  and decided to live apart. But both groups engaged in unnatural sex acts, and 
  eventually the women were starving, so they got back together. The gods were 
  displeased by their sins, though, and sent a wall of water upon them. The 
  people noticed animals running and sent cicadas to investigate. They escaped 
  the floodwaters by climbing into a fast-growing reed. Cicada dug an entrance 
  into the fifth world, which was inhabited by grebes. The grebes said that 
  people could have that world if they could survive plunging arrows into their 
  heart. The cicadas met this challenge (they bear the scars on their sides 
  still), and people live in the fifth world today. [Capinera, pp. 226-228]

  the ants. When people became corrupt and warlike a third time, Sotuknang 
  guided the ones who had retained their wisdom to Spider Woman, who cut down 
  giant reeds and sheltered the people in the hollow stems with a little water 
  and food. Sotuknang caused a great flood with rain and waves, and the people 
  floated in their reeds for a long time. Finally, they came to rest on a small 
  piece of land, and Spider Woman unsealed their reeds and pulled them out by 
  the tops of their heads. They still had as much food as they started with. 
  They sent out birds to find more land, but to no avail. They grew a tall reed 
  and climbed it, but they saw only water. But guided by their inner wisdom 
  (which comes from Sotuknang through the door at the top of their head), the 
  people traveled on, using the reeds as canoes. They went northeast, finding 
  progressively larger islands. The last of these was large and fruitful, and 
  people wanted to stay there, but Spider Woman urged them on. They went further 
  northeast, paddling hard as if going uphill, until they came to the Fourth 
  World. The shores were rocky with seemingly no place to land, but by opening 
  the doors at the tops of their head, they found a current that took them to a 
  sandy beach. Sotuknang appeared and told them to look back, and they saw the 
  islands, the last remnants of the Third World, sink into the ocean. [Waters,

  the Fourth World, which Sotuknang said was closed to them. Spider Woman and 
  the Spider Clan, however, urged them to go on, and all the clans used their 
  powers to try to melt and bread down the mountain. They tried four times but 
  failed. Sotuknang told Spider Woman that if they had succeeded, the melted 
  snow and ice would have flooded the world. He punished her by letting her grow

  <DT><A name=Jicarilla>Jicarilla Apache (northeastern New Mexico):</A> 
  <DD>Before the Apaches emerged from the underworld, there were other people on 
  the earth. Dios told an old man and old woman that it would rain forty days 
  and nights. People were warned to go to the tops of four mountains 
  (Tsisnatcin, Tsabidzilhi, Becdilhgai, and another whose identity isn't known), 
  and not to look at the flood or sky. The people didn't believe the old couple. 
  When the rains came, only a few people made it to the mountain tops and shut 
  their eyes. Those who looked at the flood turned into a fish or frog (as did 
  some who were caught in the flood); if they looked at the sky, they turned 
  into a bird. The people sitting on the mountains were told, when they got 
  hungry, to think of food, and Dios would feed them. After eighty days, Dios 
  told the 24 people remaining to open their eyes and come down. These 24 people 
  went into 24 mountains. Eight other people survived the flood who were able to 
  travel by looking where they wanted to go, and they were there. These people 
  told the Apaches about the flood before going into two mountains themselves. 
  Dios told them to say there until the world is destroyed. Around the year 
  2000, when the Apaches dwindle in number, the surface of the earth will again 
  be destroyed, this time by fire. [Opler, pp. 111-113] 
  <P>When people still lived in the underworld, the chief, after an argument 
  with his mother-in-law, decided that men and women should live apart for 
  awhile, so the men all moved to the other side of a river, and the chief 
  prayed to Kogulhtsude (a water spirit) to widen the river. They lived four 
  years like this. The women's farms became less and less productive, and they 
  began to go hungry. The men wanted sexual satisfaction and began some sexual 
  perversions; the older girls, likewise affected, began to masturbate with elk 
  horns, eagle feathers, and other things. These things impregnated them and 
  produced the monsters that afterwards killed men. About that time, Coyote 
  found a baby in a whirlpool in the river and took it out to raise himself. But 
  the baby was Kogulhtsude's child, and he sent water out to draw it back. Some 
  people were drowned and turned into frogs and fish; the other men and women 
  escaped together to a tall mountain. Coyote used his magic to make the 
  mountain grow, but the waters kept rising, finally overflowing onto this 
  world. The people suspected Coyote was causing the trouble and found the baby 
  hidden under his coat. They threw the baby (which was almost dead from drying) 
  into the water, and the water receded. The people went down into the 
  underworld again. When they later emerged, the surface of the earth was 
  covered with water from that flood. The four Holy Ones made black, blue, 
  yellow, and glittering hoops and threw them in each compass direction, and the 
  water receded. They commanded the four winds to dry the land further. [Opler,

  <P>As the waters rose, a chief led his warriors into the Superstition 
  Mountains in Arizona. When it became clear that even the mountain peaks would

  then west, then east, then rising upward as the whole world flooded. Finally 
  the box came to rest on a mountain near Santa Cantarina, where it can still be 
  seen. The world was still under water, but parrots and macaws pulled up 
  mountains and created valleys to drain the water, and the land dried. The old 
  woman, who had sat upon the box with a macaw during the flood, turned to wind 
  and disappeared. The man lived with the bitch in a cave. Every evening he 
  would return home from work in the fields to find meals prepared. He spied one 
  day and found that the bitch took off her skin and became a woman to do the 
  work. He threw her skin into the fire. She whined like a dog, but he bathed

  live there. Ants brought him corn. When he returned every day, he found food 
  prepared for him. He watched his dog and one day found her, skinless, 
  preparing corn. He threw her skin in the fire, and she began to weep. The 
  couple lived together and had a baby. One day, the man told his wife to make 
  tamales out of the "tender one," and the wife, misunderstanding, cooked their 
  child. When the man found out, he scolded his wife and ate the tamales anyway.

  a rain of fire. The sun of 4 Water lasted 676 years; then the heavens came 
  down in one day, and the people were inundated and transformed into fish. In 
  the next age, Titlacahuan (Tezcatlipoca) told a man known as "Our Father" and 
  his consort Nene to hollow out an aheuhuetl log and enter it during the vigil 
  of Toçoztli, when the heavens would come crashing down. He sealed them in with 
  a single ear of corn apiece to eat. When they had finished eating all the 
  kernels, they heard the water declining. They exited the log, found a fish, 
  and made a fire to cook it. The gods Citlallinicue and Citlallatonac 
  complained that someone was smoking up the heavens. Tezcatlipoca descended, 
  struck off the people's heads, and reattached them over their buttocks; they 
  became dogs. [Markman, pp. 132-133] 
  <P>The deluge overwhelmed mankind. Only a man named Coxcox (some call him

  tell them not to light any fire, but the smoke was already drifting into the

  <DD>Two great serpents made the sea rise to determine which of them had the 
  more powerful magic. The flood came after a strong earthquake and volcanic 
  eruption. The people took refuge on a mountain which floated close to the sun. 
  Afterwards, whenever the Araucanians felt an earthquake, they would flee to 
  the hills carrying bowls to protect their heads from the sun's heat. 
  [Vitaliano, p. 173]

  <DT><A name=CanelosQuechua>Canelos Quechua:</A> 
  <DD>Quilla, the moon, had sex with his bird sister, Jilucu. From this union 
  came the stars, as people. Quilla always came unseen at night. One night 
  Jilucu smeared genipa juice on his face, telling him it would make him feel 
  fresh. By morning the juice turned dark, and Jilucu saw that her lover was the 
  moon. The stars also knew from the moon's spotted face that they were 
  descended from an incestuous relationship. They all cried, and their crying 
  produced rain, earthquake, and flood. Volcanoes erupted, new hills formed, 
  rivers swelled; the earth people were swept eastward by a great river into the 
  sea. From this river came the sun, who began his regular course and brought an 
  orderly axis to the world. The moon and stars lost much of their power because 
  of the incestuous relationship, making night lose most of its light. The 
  people were separated from one another and had to work their way westward, 
  having many adventures along the way. [Whitten, pp. 51-52] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Quechua>Quechua:</A> 
  <DD>The world wanted to come to an end. A llama buck, knowing that the ocean 
  would soon overflow, was depressed. When its human owner complained that it 
  wouldn't eat, the llama told him that the flood would occur in five days and 
  suggested they go to Villca Coto mountain with five days' food. The man left 
  in a hurry, carrying both the llama and the supplies. They arrived at the 
  mountain to find the peak already filled with all kinds of animals. The flood 
  came as soon as they arrived and lasted five days, then it dried to the 
  ocean's normal position. The fox's tail was soaked, which turned it black. 
  Afterwards, the man began to multiply once more. [Salomon &amp; Urioste, pp. 
  51-52] 
  <P>Paria Caca, a god born from five falcon eggs, heard about a man called 
  Tamta Namca who called himself a god and had himself worshipped, and about 
  other people's sins. He went into a rage, rose up as rain, and washed them all 
  away to the ocean, together with their homes and llamas. At that time a tree 
  called the Pullao formed an arch between the Llantapa and Vichoca mountains; 
  in it lived monkeys, toucans, and other birds. These too were swept to sea. 
  [Salomon &amp; Urioste, pp. 59-60] 
  <P>Paria Caca went to the village Huauqui Usa, which was celebrating a 
  festival. He sat at the end of the banquet like a stranger. No one offered him 
  a drink while he sat there, until at the end of the day a woman finally did 
  so. Paria Caca told the woman that these people had made him mad, told her 
  that in five days something terrible would happen to the village, and warned 
  her to take her family away and not to tell anyone else, or he might kill her, 
  too. Five days later, the woman and her family left. The other villagers 
  continued drinking without a care. Paria Caca climbed Matao Coto, a mountain 
  which overlooks the village, and rising up as red and yellow hail, caused a 
  torrential rainstorm. It washed all the villagers to the ocean and shaped the 
  slopes and valleys of the area. [Salomon &amp; Urioste, pp. 61-62] He 
  similarly exterminated another village where no one offered him a drink. 
  [Salomon &amp; Urioste, p. 127] 
  <P>The Inca summoned people from every village to help defeat their enemies. 
  Paria Caca sent his child Maca Uisa. When nobody else at the meeting offered 
  to help, Maca Uisa said he would defeat the enemies completely. Strong litter 
  bearers carried him to the battle front, and as soon as he got there, he 
  started raining on them, gently at first, then pouring rain. He washed away 
  their villages in a mudslide and killed their strong men with lightning bolts. 
  Only a few common people were spared. [Salomon &amp; Urioste, p. 115] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Inca>Inca (Peru):</A> 
  <DD>The water rose above the highest mountain in the world. All created things 
  perished, except for a man and woman who floated in a box. When the flood 
  subsided, the floating box was driven by the wind to Tiahuanacu, about 200 
  miles from Cuzco. [Gaster, p. 127] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Chiriguano>Chiriguano (southeast Bolivia):</A> 
  <DD>The evil supernatural being Aguara-Tunpa declared war against the god 
  Tunpaete, Creator of the Chiriguanos. He set fire to the prairies in autumn, 
  destroying all the plants and land animals. The people, who had not then begun 
  farming, nearly died of hunger, but they retreated to the banks of rivers and 
  survived on fish. Seeing people still surviving, Aguara-Tunpa caused a 
  torrential rain. Acting on a hint given them by Tunpaete, the Chiriguanos 
  placed two sibling babies, a boy and a girl, on a large mate leaf and set it 
  afloat on the water. The flood rose, covering the earth and killing the rest 
  of the Chiriguanos, but the two babies survived and eventually landed on solid 
  ground when the flood sank. There, they found fish to eat, but they had no way 
  to cook it. Fortunately, before the flood, a frog had taken some hot coals in 
  his mouth, and it kept them alight during the flood by blowing on them. He 
  gave the fire to the children, and they were able to roast their fish. In 
  time, they grew up, and the Chiriguanos are descended from them. [Gaster, pp. 
  127-128] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Chorote>Chorote (Eastern Paraguay):</A> 
  <DD>The bottle tree (<I>Chorisia insignis</I>) once contained all the water 
  and all the fish. The tree had a locked door. Fox stole the key and 
  thoughtlessly opened the door wide. The waters rushed out, flooding the world 
  and bringing all kinds of fish. Fox drowned. [Bierhorst, 1988, p. 123] 
  <P>In a former time when there were a great many people, the earth sank. Then 
  water began to seep out. It kept rising until it became a flood. Some boys 
  were saved, plucked from the water by a white bird; all other people drowned. 
  [Bierhorst, 1988, p. 142] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Toba>Toba (Northern Argentina):</A> 
  <DD>Rainbow does not like menstruating women to enter the water, or even to 
  drink from it. One day a young woman broke this taboo because her mother and 
  sisters didn't leave her any drinking water when they left for the day. Driven 
  by thirst, she went to the lagoon. When she had returned, Rainbow, full of 
  anger, caused a strong wind, accompanied by whirlwinds and heavy rain. All 
  were drowned in the ensuing flood. [Bierhorst, 1988, pp. 142-143] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Selknam>Selk'nam (southern tip of Argentina):</A> 
  <DD>At one time, people didn't die; instead, they just slept awhile and woke 
  up refreshed. After many lives, some got tired of being human and turned into 
  rocks, clouds, animals, and such. A flood came which covered the world. People 
  floundered around in the cold water. Some climbed onto ice floes and joined 
  the penguins, playing and eating fish as the penguins did. In time, they 
  turned into large penguins. When the water went down, some people went back to 
  living as humans, but others stayed emperor penguins. [Brusca &amp; Wilson, p. 
  "E"] 
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=Yamana>Yamana (Tierra del Fuego):</A> 
  <DD>Léxuwakipa, the rusty brown spectacled ibis, felt offended by the people, 
  so she let it snow so much that ice came to cover the entire earth. This 
  happened at the time of Yáiaasága, when men seized power from the women. When 
  the ice melted, it rapidly flooded all the earth. People hurried to their 
  canoes, but many didn't make it, and more perished when they couldn't find 
  sheltered places. Some people reached the five mountaintops which stayed above 
  the flood. These mountains were Usláka, Wémarwaia, Auwáratuléra, Welalánux, 
  and Piatuléra. The water stayed at its high mark for two days and then rapidly 
  lowered. Signs of the floodwaters still show up on those mountains. The few 
  families which survived rebuilt their huts on the shore. Men have ruled women 
  since then. [Wilbert, pp. 27-28] 
  <P>The moon-woman Hánuxa caused the flood because she was full of hatred 
  against the people, especially the men, who had taken over the women's secret 
  <I>kina</I> ceremony and made it their own. A few people survived on five 
  mountaintops. [Wilbert, p. 29] 
  <P>The sun sank into the sea, causing its waters to rise tumultuously and to 
  cover all the earth except the summit of a single mountain. A few people 
  survived there. [Gaster, p. 128] </P></DD></DL>
