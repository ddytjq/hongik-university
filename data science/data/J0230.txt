<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rallying is the most popular form of motor
sport in Britain, with over <font size=+1>1,000</font> permits for events
issued by the MSA each year.&nbsp; The organisation of any rally requires
a large amount of detailed work to ensure that the event runs correctly
with the minimum of impact upon the general public.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; There are numerous different
types of rallies ranging from the humble club night navigational event
through to the International Stage Rally, however, the same basic principles
apply to all events regardless.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; All motor clubs organising
rallies whether they use the public highway or not are required to comply
with the relevant sections of the MSA Yearbook.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Rallies can be split into
two main categories which can then be subdivided further:</font></b>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A. Road Events</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These are events whose main element of
competition takes place on the public highway.&nbsp; Road events often
require competitors to maintain a time schedule over a demanding route
with time controls along the route.&nbsp; The route will be defined by
various navigational techniques which may be issued to competitors at regular
intervals along the route.&nbsp; Cars used may be totally standard or prepared
to a limited level in compliance with the relevant Technical Regulations.&nbsp;
It is not necessary to have a fully prepared car to compete on these events
although a few minor modifications may be helpful.&nbsp; The events can
be subdivided as follows:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Road Rally</font> - A competitive
event which can be timed to the minute or second with a route length usually
in the region of 100 to 180 miles taking place overnight on a Saturday/Sunday.&nbsp;
The route instructions cannot be issued before the start of the event and
the maintenance of a strict time schedule forms the basis for the competition.&nbsp;
Some events use a large element of "white" roads that give competitors
a bit of variation.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Navigation Rally</font> -
These events are of a similar format to road rallies, however the navigational
skills of the crew are a major factor in determining the winner.&nbsp;
Sections must be timed to the minute only.&nbsp; With navigational rallies
the technical regulations relating to competing vehicles are slightly relaxed
as a performance car is not necessarily the key to success on these events.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Twelve Car Rally</font> -
Organised by motor clubs for their own members and usually taking place
on a weekday evening these events are of a similar format to Navigational
rallies, but are limited to twelve cars only.&nbsp; They usually have a
route of between 50 and 60 miles and are ideal for the novice and beginner
to learn the ropes.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Navigational Scatter</font>
- A navigational event where crews are expected to visit a number of predetermined
points but the route to visitation is generally free.&nbsp; The crews will
be expected to locate clues at each point, some of which they may have
to get out of the car to locate.&nbsp; For these events no merit is placed
on visiting more than 75% of the controls and timing is only governed by
a finishing time.&nbsp; A navigator is not always necessary nor is a car
as it is only the incidental means of transport.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">B. Stage Rallies</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stage rallies are events where crews compete
against each other on timed sections known as stages.&nbsp; These sections
must take place on either private land or roads closed by law to all other
traffic.&nbsp; The stages are usually timed to the second and the emphasis
is upon driver skill and car control, rather than navigational plotting
skills.&nbsp; Cars must be prepared to a high standard and a check for
compliance before each event (scrutineering) will take place.&nbsp; Each
stage is linked by a section called a Neutral or Road Section which may
be a public highway and is timed at under 28 mph average speed.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are two types of Stage Rallies:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Multi-Use Stage Rally</font>
- An event usually taking place on one venue with no public highway link
sections.&nbsp; Disused airfields and race circuits are popular venues
for these types of events.&nbsp; Stages can be used more than once, however,
certain restrictions are placed upon the amount of times a stage can be
used unless slight changes are made to its layout.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Multi-Venue Stage Rally</font>
- An event where stages are located at different venues, which may be used
no more than four times.&nbsp; Stages are linked by Neutral or Road Sections
often on the public highway.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Organisation</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All rallies need a permit to be issued
by the MSA prior to them being held.&nbsp; The permit must be applied for
at least six weeks but not more than four months prior to the event.&nbsp;
The permit contains detailed information as to what is required to have
been undertaken prior to its issue.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; A rally must comply with
the relevant section of the MSA Year Book.&nbsp; The information that competitors
must comply with, together with any other relevant information such as
the start venue, mileages, surfaces, etc, will be contained in a set of
Supplementary Regulations which are issued by the organising club.&nbsp;
These Supplementary Regulations will also include an entry form.</font></b>
<h2>
<a NAME="authorisation"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Authorisation</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All rallies that include sections run on
the public highway are governed by the Motor Vehicles (Competition and
Trials) Regulations 1969.&nbsp; A formal application for approval must
be made by the event organiser to the MSA Competitions Authorisation Section
(CAS) using form E404.&nbsp; They handle all events within England and
Wales.&nbsp; The Royal Scottish Automobile Club handle applications for
Scotland.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Some types of events are
automatically authorised provided the local Route Liason Officer (RLO)
approves the route of the event.&nbsp; These events are detailed in Section
K of the MSA Yearbook (Blue Book).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-Use Stage Rallies
which do not use the public highway are exempt from this procedure.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Any application for authorisation
must be submitted no earlier than 6 months and no later than 2 months prior
to the event.&nbsp; The official application form must be accompanied by
2 copies of a tracing detailing the whole route of the rally taken from
<a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/products/Landranger/index.cfm?shop_id=1">1:50
000 scale Landranger OS maps</a> together with locations of controls and
a time schedule.&nbsp; A copy of the tracing should also be sent to the
relevant RLO(s).&nbsp; Upon receipt of the tracings the CAS section will
copy them to the local police authorities for the area being visited.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the event a per
capita fee will be payable based on the total number of starters and mileage
of the event.&nbsp; Authorisation will not be granted unless this fee is
paid to the CAS.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications in Scotland
are slightly different as the tracings are made on 1:250 000 scale maps
and letters of authority must be submitted to the RSAC from local police
authorities whose area the route traverses.</font></b>

<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Insurance:</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By issuing a permit for an event the MSA
automatically arranges a Legal Liability (third party) insurance cover
to protect clubs organising events.&nbsp; These policies provide protection
against any third party claims to the club and its officials.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition competitors
on stage rallies on private land benefit from insurance against third party
claims.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Where private land is used
on a rally whether for a special stage or otherwise, the landowner may
require the club to make good any accidental damage that may occur.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The MSA can arrange contractual
liability cover to protect clubs from any such claims.&nbsp; This cover
must be arranged in advance of the event by the organising club with the
MSA.&nbsp; Cover cannot be arranged for damage to road surfacings.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The motor vehicle insurance
policies held by most competitors will specifically exclude the use of
the vehicle on public roads for rallies.&nbsp; Where a competitor is unable
to arrange their own insurance through their existing policy, the club
should arrange for a suitable scheme.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To operate the scheme
the club must apply to the insurer in writing at least 21 days prior to
the event.&nbsp; The insurer will then issue a blanket certificate of insurance
for the rally which will allow any competitor, provided they have a letter
of acceptance and can sign a declaration and pay the relevant fee, to take
part in the event under the event insurance.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Event insurance schemes
known to the MSA are:</font></b>

<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Event officials:</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For any rally there are numerous tasks
that must be undertaken.&nbsp; The size of the team that undertakes these
tasks will be dependent upon the size and nature of the event being organised.&nbsp;
For a twelve car rally perhaps one person can undertake all of the duties,
however, for a major event the following officials will be required:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Clerk of the Course</font>:
The Clerk of the Course is the event manager.&nbsp; This person has overall
responsibility to ensure compliance with the relevant regulations.They
must also keep the event on track in its early stages of organisation to
ensure that deadlines are achieved by the other team members.&nbsp; The
Clerk of the Course also acts as the first judicial body when protests
are made.&nbsp; The Clerk of the Course may have an assistant if required.&nbsp;
This is a useful position for a new organiser as it allows them to gain
a taste of what it is like organising an event.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Secretary of the Meeting</font>:
Responsible for the general event paperwork and to manage "the office"
for the Clerk of the Course.&nbsp; The Secretary will be involved with
signing-on and competitor liason.&nbsp; Much of the documentation for the
event will be produced by the Secretary.&nbsp; It is a busy role and for
smaller events may be combined with the role of Entries Secretary.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Entries Secretary</font>:
To be responsible for receiving entries and relevant fees and organising
event signing-on with the Secretary of the Meeting.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Chief Marshal</font>: The
role of the Chief Marshal should not be underestimated as it is this person's
job to arrange the supply of marshals for the event and to ensure that
they know what to do and where to go.&nbsp; In the present climate recruiting
marshals can be extremely difficult and someone who has several contacts
could be a useful person to fulfil this role.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Timekeeper</font>: To arrange
the supply and distribution of timing equipment for the event.&nbsp; Also
required to ensure timing equipment is accurate and set in accordance with
MSA Requirements and tolerances to BBC/Telecom time.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Scrutineer</font>: To ensure
that the competition vehicles all comply with MSA technical regulations
that apply to the specific event.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Stewards</font>: On rallies
of clubman status only one Steward is required.&nbsp; All others need three
Stewards.&nbsp; The Stewards are there to act as impartial observers and
to ensure that the event is run in accordance with the regulations.&nbsp;
They also act as a second judicial body should an appeal be made against
the decision of the clerk of the course.&nbsp; It must be noted that Stewards
should not be permitted to undertake any other official post.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public relations:</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All rallies require some form of Public
Relations exercise (PR) to be undertaken along the proposed route.&nbsp;
The exact amount of PR work required is detailed in Section K of the MSA
Yearbook.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The PR work is necessary
to minimise the disruption caused by an event, warn people on the route
of the event and to protect the future of the sport.&nbsp; It must be carried
out by trustworthy club officials and far enough in advance of the event
so that problems can be overcome in plenty of time.&nbsp; Re-routes may
be required and these must be processed via the CAS.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; When undertaking the PR
work it is essential that a diplomatic approach is made and that you do
not ask for permission from the householders en route as this can lead
to unnecessary difficulties.&nbsp; Inform them of the event, leave a PR
Letter and have them sign the PR Register which must be kept for all PR
work carried out.&nbsp; In England and Wales you must also refrain from
implying that the Police have authorised the event.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The RLO(S) for the area
may request that additional PR work is undertaken in sensitive areas.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The PR Register must be
available for inspection by the Clerk of the Course, Stewards and RLO(s).</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road event specifics:</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A road event can be quite a complex beast
to control, however by following a series of pointers problems should be
minimised.&nbsp; In particular night time events can cause the most problems
as they run at anti-social hours in remote locations.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Sections</font> on road
events need to be carefully planned depending on the type of section.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard and Regularity
Sections are the competitive elements of the route and may be timed to
a legal maximum average speed of 30 mph.&nbsp; Often "whites" (unsurfaced
tracks) are used on these events to maintain a challenge to competitors.&nbsp;
The routes of these sections should be designed to avoid built up areas
wherever possible.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutral and Transport sections
are the linking parts of the route whose main purpose is to allow competitors
to travel through villages, PR sensitive areas and along long stretches
of main roads to link different parts of the event together.&nbsp; These
can only be timed at 28 mph average in the case of Neutrals.&nbsp; Transport
Sections can be timed at 30 mph average.&nbsp; Time controls on the public
highway must be a minimum of 2 miles apart.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst <font size=+1>planning
the event route</font> you must be mindful of the style of event, the time
of year and the length of route.&nbsp; There is no use running an event
on top of the North Yorkshire Moors in early February as the majority of
the route could be blocked by snowfalls.&nbsp; It is also essential to
take into account locations of the start, finish and importantly petrol/rest
halts.&nbsp; In remote locations it may be difficult to find a garage that
will open in the middle of the night to service your competitors.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The time control locations
that you select need to allow plenty of space for the marshal to park and
to allow other road users to pass when competing cars are waiting.&nbsp;
This is especially important at the end of a long Neutral or Transport
section where a queue of several cars may develop.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings us onto <font size=+1>marshals</font>.&nbsp;
For a road event a large number of marshals are required.&nbsp; However
by planning the route effectively you can allow many of the marshalling
crews to "double up" and thus help reduce your manpower requirements.&nbsp;
Marshals should be given specific instructions of what to do and how to
find their control point never assume they have a map with them!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also be necessary
to man any gates and/or fords en route to reduce the risk of problems occurring
- such as livestock escaping from a field or a car drowning out and holding
up the whole event.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Event paperwork:</font>
The paperwork for every event is different, however by maintaining a consistent,
clear and informative approach, the competitors will know what is going
on and what to expect.&nbsp; Route cards, time cards and other documents
must be checked by the organising team for correctness.&nbsp; The route
cards in particular should also be checked by a trustworthy independent
person.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stage event specifics</font></b></h2>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Officials:</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For Stage Rallies there are some extra
Officials that need to be apopinted and some of the previous Officials
must be licensed by the MSA.</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Chief Timekeeper</font>:
The Chief Timekeeper must be from the MSA appointed list of Timekeepers.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Chief Scrutineer</font>:
The Chief Scrutineer must be from the MSA appointed list of Scrutineers
appropriate to the grade of event.&nbsp; The Chief Scrutineer will also
be responsible for booking a number of other scrutineers depending on how
many entries are received for an event.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Chief Safety Officer</font>:
The Chief Safety Officer is responsible for booking the relevant Safety,
Rescue and Recovery vehicles along with Doctors and Paramedics.&nbsp; He
is also responsible for producing an event safety plan and ensuring that
this is adhered to on the day.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Radio Controller</font>:
The event Radio Controller is a very important job on any Stage Rally,
but especially on a Multi-Venue event where the Clerk of the Course may
be out of Communication range and he may well be required to make some
important decisions.&nbsp; For this reason when appointing a Radio Controller
you need someone who is both conversant with all current radio procedures
and can work under pressure.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Stage Commander</font>: The
Stage Commander is responsible for ensuring a Stage is fully ready to run
by the appointed time, and for dealing first hand with any safety and operational
details.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Press Officer</font>: Depending
on the size of your event, you may well be inundated with media requests
for information.&nbsp; One person should handle this.&nbsp; If you have
an incident on your event all media enquiries should be directed to this
person.&nbsp; If you are unfortunate enough to have a fatality on your
event, all media enquiries should be directed to the MSA.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Forest Enterprise:</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To organise a rally using <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/">Forest
Enterprise</a> land clubs are required to apply to the MSA on the appropriate
form in the year before that in which the rally is to be held.&nbsp; The
regional association that the club is a member of must endorse the application
to the MSA.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the application is successful
the club will be notified that it has an allocation to use Forest Enterprise
land.&nbsp; The granting of an allocation does not guarantee that forestry
roads will be available in the area that you may wish to run the rally.&nbsp;
The club must start discussions with the appropriate Forestry Liaison Officer
to discover what forestry roads may be available for their use.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Forestry Liaison Officers
are listed in the Officiais'Yearbook (Red Book).</font></b>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Servicing:</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On any type of Stage Rally you will be
expected to provide an area for the servicing of competing cars.&nbsp;
There are many ways of doing this.&nbsp; Roadside service is becoming rare.&nbsp;
These days, most clubs are opting for dedicated service areas, where more
control can be provided.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chronological timetable</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To assist organisers the following is a
chronological guide as to when certain elements of event organisations
should be undertaken and by whom.&nbsp; Seasoned organisers may do things
differently, however, the timetable has not been prepared for nor is it
