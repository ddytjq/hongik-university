        your account at any time, without giving reason, after giving any notice 
        required by the special conditions applying to the account, except where 
        the investment has been accepted for a fixed term which has not expired.</font></p>

          any of the following reasons (which may relate to circumstances existing 
          at the time or those which are expected to apply in the near future)
