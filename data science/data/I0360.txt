  Two days before the big game in Scotland, with my plans set for a 12:00 start
  in my local pub, I got a phone call.&nbsp; Also in the room was my (very
  understanding) fiancée and she would have heard the following: &quot;<i>Hello...alright
  Steve......Not bad, yourself.......You what....Course I'll f***in' have
  it.....yes......see you Saturday&quot;</i>&nbsp; I turned to her but she
  already knew.&nbsp; She gave a small tut and carried on watching the
  telly.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I decided that a little jig around the kitchen was in
  order.&nbsp; After all, I was going to Hampden Park.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I've always found it strange how an alarm clock which sounds at 5:15 during
  the week gets either verbal abuse, violent abuse or even ignored, yet on a
  Saturday match day I can be awake before that lovely piercing buzzing sound.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The coach for Glasgow was due to leave the G-mex in Manchester at 7am, we were
  the last to arrive at about five-to.&nbsp; Subsequently the four of us were
  split up and I ended up sat next to a lad called Gary, a Leeds fan from
  Halifax with who I had a good chat with for most of the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Bearing in mind the time of day and the distinct lack of booze, the journey up
  the M6 was relatively peaceful.&nbsp; After a short stop near Carlisle, we
  crossed the border into &quot;sweaty sock land&quot; and anybody who travelled
  up there that day wouldn't have failed to notice the &quot;Welcome to
  Scotland&quot; sign and its new decoration, a flag of St George,
  brilliant.&nbsp; The chances of another service station break were looking
  bleak as every slip road in Scotland had least two police cars on the slip
  road, making sure we couldn't have another piss.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  As we pulled up outside the away end on arrival, we were surrounded by Scotland's
  finest and fortunately, I suppose, none the local dick-heads were allowed
  anywhere near us. <i>(friendliest supporters in the world? - read on)</i>
  Since the local pubs had a slightly hostile feel, we decided that getting into
  the ground earlier would be a sensible decision.&nbsp; The atmosphere was
  electric and the tension was immense by the time the two teams emerged from
  the tunnel.&nbsp; Much has been said about the booing of the national anthems
  and when &quot;God save the Queen&quot; was played, I couldn't hear a single
  not, the noise was incredible.&nbsp; The transvestites whistled and jeered as
  loud as you can imagine possible, but in the end it was pointless anyway, the
  6,000 English sang our song over and over again to a point where it was
  impossible to drown out.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The match itself was somewhat of a non event.&nbsp; England gave a good solid
  performance winning 2-0 courtesy of a Paul Scholes brace.&nbsp; The only disappointment
  of the day came at half-time.&nbsp; I queued up for what seemed like an
  eternity for a pie of which there were three types for sale: Steak and Kidney,
  Chicken Balti and Scotch.&nbsp; By the time I finally got served there was
  only one variety left - and for the record, Scotch pies taste like shit.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The second half was heaven.&nbsp; The famous Tartan army, in what many of them
  saw as perhaps the biggest game of their lifetime just sat in silence as we
  rubbed salt deep into their wounds with a couple of chants &quot;<i>Where's
  your famous Hampden Roar?&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Your just a third world
  country&quot;.</i>&nbsp; Their only reply was showing to display their bare
  arse under their kilts!!!!.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Obviously, offending the Scotts at such a sensitive moment would have its
  consequences and so, when we boarded our coaches, we were somewhat wary of
  what was waiting in the streets in and around the streets of Glasgow.&nbsp; As
  we pulled out of the car park, groups of lads were stood on every corner, the
  tartan had long since vanished and had been replaced by aggressive looking
  bastards. The coaches crawled through at an agonising pace and it wasn't long
  before we noticed that the coach in front was missing some windows, we were
  surely next.&nbsp; A young lad came from nowhere out of an ally way, a
  two-litre wine bottle was gripped firmly in his hand.&nbsp; He pulled his arm
  back behind his shoulder and took aim.&nbsp; My heart stopped as the entire
  coach ducked and then....nothing, the little bastard had blagged us all, he
  kept hold of the bottle not wishing to waste any of its content and he just
  kept giving us the V-sign laughing his head off - the little bastard.&nbsp;<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The second leg was rubbish, we lost 1-0 with a performance that reeked with
  complacency.&nbsp; Thankfully though, the aggregate score took us the the low
  countries for Euro2000 and only the Scotland fans will remember this
  match.&nbsp; Think of it this way, if the Wembley game was played first, then
  that 2-0 win at Hampden would have been one of our finest ever
  victories.&nbsp; See you in Amsterdam.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;

  This
  was the most anticipated match of the competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Everybody knows the meaning of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this
  fixture, from that match at Wembley in 66, the disaster from Leon in Mexico
  ’70, that emotional night in Turin during Italia ’90 and the heartbreaking
  penalty shootout of Euro 96, this fixture always comes with a background
  story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I had been successful
  in my ticket application and from about February onwards, I had been saving up
  and looking forward to this date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
  our brilliant trouble-free expedition to Eindhoven five days earlier, it was disappointing
  to see and hear of the arrests and disturbance from Belgium on the night
  before the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thousands of
  English fans were being arrested and deported for the crime of “not carrying
  their passport” but for my small group, the trip could not have gone any
  better.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We were flying from Manchester to Heathrow to Brussels on the
  Saturday morning and then back the same route on the Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Millsy and Ste were due to share the driving of the hire-car once we
  arrived in Brussels so myself and Ian had the chance for a little drink
  between flights in London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
  a couple of pints of Export and a few chasers and announcement came over the
  tannoy – “Due to an air traffic control computing problem, all flights are
  subject to delay”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A quick
  glance at the departures board was met with disbelief, every single flight was
  accompanied with the word “Delayed”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whilst
  at the bar, the lady serving told me we could be here all day and that it
  would be a good idea to proceed to our gate because there’s a TV there and
  we could get a good seat to watch the match!!!!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Kick off was not for eight hours, my face dropped (as did my
  arse) as the seriousness of the situation dawned on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I relayed the news back to the others but only an hour later we were
  called to gate 28.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  By 14:00 we
  were all sat on the plane and waiting to take off, only an hour and a half
  late, brilliant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the pilot
  spoke, “Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen” etc etc “I only called you
  onto the plane in case we get an earlier take off time than our current
  allocation which is 4:00”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>4:00 wasn’t too bad we thought, we’d be there for 5:00, plus the
  hour, 6:00, plus an hour getting the hire car and driving to Charleroi would
  still give us 1 hour and 45 minutes to spare, providing of course that we
  could find the stadium first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
  didn’t know it then, but take off was not until 5:00 English time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Half of the plane was destined for the match but not one of us had
  taken the pilots offer of leaving the aircraft even though we could easily be
  missing the kick off in Brussels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  British Airways staff did everything they could to make the situation more
  bearable, the back doors were open for fresh air, mobile phones were
  permitted, the pilot walked up and down the aisle talking to his passengers
  and the drinks trolley was free!!!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
  I repeat, alcoholic drinks were FREE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About
  30 minutes into this very kind offer and the lager and bitter ran out and we
  had moved onto whisky, then red wine, white wine and finally a few small
  bottles of champagne were supped for good measure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I was pissed, Ian was pissed, the two drivers were not.&nbsp;</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  At 7:00
  Brussels time we staggered through passport control and out onto the car park
  looking for the car rental company but we could only find some Corporate
  Hospitality Coaches who gave us a free lift to the ground but with one
  exception.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Help yourself to
  some free lagers lads” they said and believe me, we didn’t need telling
  twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our two designated drivers
  had now joined in with the drinking and between us we finished the full crate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  The coach dropped us off near the stadium and during that short walk, I didn't
  see one German supporter, such was the extent of the segregation.</span></font>&nbsp;
  <font face="CG Times" size="3"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">For some
  reason, </span>the rest of the day seems a little vague to me although I do remember
  that the English players scored and the Germans didn’t but how we found our
  coach after the match I’ll never know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Our next task upon arrival back at Brussels Airport was to find a bit
  of floor space for some kip, not that easy as it was covered in sleeping
  English fans sprawled all over the rock hard marble floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What a day it had been, We’d been on two flights, got pissed and seen
  England beat the Germans 1-0, but on top of that, I still had £70 of Belgian
  Francs in my pocket, the only money that I spent was on a sandwich and a Euro
  2000 badge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>meant that I could afford to buy my wife some perfume as a
  peace offering for me being away, after all, I must keep on her good side, its
  Japan in 2002.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><u>Thanks

    got to Paris on the Thursday afternoon with the game on the Saturday. None
    of us had been to Paris before and arriving in the city centre on the train
    we caught from the airport was quite nerve racking for a twenty year old and
    two eighteen year olds who live in the middle of no where, known to some
    people as ‘sleepsville’</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">We
    asked the dodgiest bloke I think we could of found for directions to our
    hotel. He turned out to be a star, but I was convinced he was going to mug
    us and had in actual fact sent us in the opposite direction to our hotel,
    where a gang of onion wielding Frenchmen were lying in wait. Thankfully I
    was wrong.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">The
    hotel was situated in a smart housing estate and we thought we’d done well
    for ourselves with our choice. When we got inside, Madame Vronski, the
    hotelier, who looked like someone who would appear in an edition of Readers
    Wives showed us to our room. She told us her first name, which sounded like
    Bernard, which is what we decided to call her for our entire stay. Strangely
    enough she seemed to like it.</font></p>

    room was ok and the St Georges cross went straight up in the window.
    Unfortunately it couldn’t be seen from the street and only intimidated the
    family next door who’s garden we overlooked.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">We
    decided to hit the streets of Paris straight away, and start enjoying French
    hospitality. After a Chinese, not very French I know, and two bottles of
    wine, we found a Brazilian bar that sold double vodka’s for a quid. There
    was an Italian guy working behind the bar who was chatting to us about
    English football and how it was the best in the world. We could only agree.
    We then moved on to a local nightclub called Gibus. It was a Latino, salsa
    bar. Unfortunately Thursday nights was singles night and packed with 40
    something men and women desperate for a shag. Three young English lads stuck
    out like a sore thumb. The night was going well and we were all having a
    laugh. The bar staff kept spraying us with drinks if we danced on the
    tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We weren’t sure if
    they were spraying us to make us stay on the tables or to get us off them,
    but we stayed there anyway. We eventually left before we were kicked out
    with one of my mates, Andy, pissed out of his face and at this point half
    naked. My other mate Ben went to buy a grapefruit to eat on the way home,
    but something was lost in the translation and ended up paying £10 for it.
    We managed to smuggle Andy, who by this point was shirtless, trying to take
    his trousers off, and unable to walk, past Bernard, into the lift and back
    to the room. During the night, he was sick everywhere and pissed against the
    door, which I wouldn’t of minded but he was stood next to the toilet. We
    cleared it up with one of his T-shirts and threw it into the next door’s
    garden. How they must of loved us.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">The
    next day, feeling rough we went to see all the sights, climbed the Eiffel
    Tower, went up the Seine etc etc etc. At night we went to the Red light
    district, which was full of England fans. We went to one pub and almost
    bought a pint for £5, but after Ben’s expensive grapefruit incident we
    started working things out instead of just paying and came to the conclusion
    that all Parisians are thieving bastards. A bloke saying the immortal words
    “Fucky, fucky, big fanny” then approached us and pointed to a woman who
    was the spitting image of Gloria Hunniford. Our French GCSE came into it’s
    own as we politely declined, “With that old bitch, fuck off” is a rough
    translation. Ben, who was not having much luck, then got a smack from some
    English bloke who thought he was French. To be fair to this bloke, you can
    see why he thought he was. We then nearly got attacked my a homeless bloke,
    who loitered around for a bit then ran at us screaming. Time to go we
    thought. Looking back it was hilarious. We got back to the hotel room and in
    the house next door we could see a couple shagging through the reflection of
    the window of the house over the road. By this time we were knackered and
    then remembered why we had actually come to Paris in the first place.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">Finally
    the day of the game. We went to the ground early to hang our flags up and
    have a look round. The game itself was good and Michael Owen’s late goal
    made it all worth it. The things that stuck in my mind from the game were
    Owen’s goal, the deafening roar that greeted it, the big French shirt and
    some twat sat behind who turned to his mate and said, “Look, it says But
    on the score boards, the dozy French fuckers, it was Owen’s goal wasn’t
    it” Not even his mate had the balls to tell him But is French for goal. I
    managed to get a programme from my Brother in law, who had some how sneaked
    into the exec bit and nicked me one. So my first England away game had ended
    in a 1-1 draw with the world champions, not bad.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">We
    got back to our hotel and found the Brazilian bar again and got a heroes
    welcome from our Italian friend and boss who hate the French. They brought
    us free drinks and again double vodka’s were a quid. Again, the night
    ended with us in a messy state. At one point Andy was in a shopping trolley
    hurtling down a busy main road. He had to crash the trolley against the curb
    to get out.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="CG Times" size="3">In
    the morning we said our goodbyes to Bernard and set off for home. At the
    Airport Ben literally bumped into Emanuel Petit, knocking him out of the way
    to ask someone which gate we needed to go to. He was on his way back to
    Madrid with his Model wife. Lucky bastard we thought, but then consoled
    ourselves with the thought at least we’re not French.</font></p>
