<P>Mechanix Wear to sponsor Pit Crew of the Year Award in NASCAR Winston Cup Series.<BR><BR>Mechanix Wear is proud to announce that it will sponsor an official NASCAR Winston Cup Series year-end award to honor the best pit crew for the 2002 season.  The Mechanix Wear Pit Crew of the Year Award is a $ 75,000 prize awarded to the winning pit crew as selected by the crew chiefs in the Winston Cup Series.  The winning crew will be chosen from 4 quarterly finalists which will be determined by a points awarded for finishes in the top 15 of each race. The complete rules for the award as well as the current points standings are outlined below.<BR><BR>An Official NASCAR Winston Cup Series Year-End Award.<BR><BR>Prize Money -  $ 75,000 to the winning crew.<BR><BR><BR><BR>The award will be determined as follows:<BR><BR>The 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series has been divided into 4 quarters.<BR><BR>1st Quarter 	 Daytona 2-18 through Talladega 4-21.<BR><BR>2nd Quarter	California 4-28 through Chicagoland 6-14.<BR><BR>3rd Quarter	New Hampshire 6-21 through New Hampshire 9-15.<BR><BR>4th Quarter	Dover 9-22 through Phoenix 11-10.<BR><BR>During each quarter, the top 15 eligible teams finishing each NASCAR Winston Cup Series event will be awarded points in the following manner:<BR><BR>1st -----------                        15 points<BR>	<BR>2nd -----------                        14 points<BR>	<BR>3rd -----------                        13 points<BR>	<BR>4th -----------                        12 points<BR>	<BR>5th -----------                        11 points<BR>	<BR>6th -----------                        10 points<BR>	<BR>7th -----------                         9 points<BR>	<BR>8th -----------                         8 points<BR><BR>9th -----------                         7 points<BR><BR>10th ----------                        6 points<BR><BR>11th ----------                        5 points<BR><BR>12th ----------                        4 points<BR><BR>13th ----------                        3 points<BR><BR>14th ----------                        2 points<BR><BR>15th ----------                        1 point<BR><BR>At the end of each quarter, the team with the greatest number of points wins that quarter, becomes a year-end nominee and is no longer eligible for points. At the completion of the 4th quarter there will be 4 NASCAR Winston Cup Series teams eligible for the final voting. The crew chiefs competing at Homestead-Miami Speedway on November 17th will be eligible to cast a vote for one of the 4 teams (39 maximum total votes based on the top 43 teams in the current 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Championship points as of November 13th minus the 4 crew chiefs of the teams eligible). The team receiving the most votes will receive the award. In the event of a tie, the team finishing highest in the final 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Championship points will receive the award.<BR><BR><BR><BR>The NAPCM applauds MechanixWear and specifically Ted Abdon for recognizing the hardest working men and women in auto racing.  This award is long overdue and the NAPCM extends our thanks to MechanixWear for Ted Abdon's efforts to put pit crew and team members in the spotlight. </P>
