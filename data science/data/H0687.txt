<P>
Nef is one of the five so-called auxiliary genes of primate lentiviruses, a group
that also includes vif, vpr, vpu (in HIV-1 and SIVCPZ), and vpx (in HIV-2 and other
SIV strains). Inactivating these genes does not completely prevent viral replication
in cell culture (reviewed in (Cullen, 1998)), but studies conducted both in
SIV-infected monkeys and in HIV-infected individuals have revealed that they encode
important virulence factors. Three major functions of Nef have been uncovered
through in vitro analyses: the downregulation of CD4 and MHC class I, the
stimulation of virion infectivity, and the capacity to alter the activation state of
cells. 
<P>
<b>Nef, an important virulence factor</b>
<P>
Nef is abundantly produced during the early phase of viral gene expression, when its
mRNA represents three quarters of the viral mRNA load of the cell (Guy et al., 1987;
Klotman et al., 1991). Nef stimulates viral growth both in cell culture and in vivo.
Studies in rhesus monkeys indicated early on that Nef is important for achieving
high levels of viremia and for disease induction (Kestler et al., 1991). Attenuated
forms of HIV-1 and HIV-2 deleted in nef were also identified in individuals
presenting as long term-non progressors (Deacon et al., 1995; Kirchhoff et al.,
1995; Learmont et al., 1999; Mariani et al., 1996; Salvi et al., 1998; Switzer
et al., 1998). Finally, in a recently described transgenic mouse model, Nef expression
in CD4 positive cells caused an AIDS-like disease in the absence of viral
replication (Hanna et al., 1998). 
<P>
A difficult, yet rewarding, task has been to identify the molecular mechanisms hidden
behind the three major known functions of Nef. A considerable amount of information
has been obtained thanks to the combined power of structural, functional and genetic
analyses.
<P> 
<b>General biochemical and structural features of Nef</b>
<P>
HIV-1 Nef is a myristoylated protein of 206 amino acids that associates with
cellular membranes (Niederman et al., 1993). The Nef proteins of HIV-2 and SIV are
slightly longer, approximately 250 amino acids in length. Nef is also phosphorylated
on serine and threonine, although the role of this modification is unclear (Yang and
Gabuzda, 1999).
<P>
The understanding of Nef mechanisms of action has been facilitated by the
determination of its three-dimensional structure. The crystal structure of the core
of HIV-1 Nef complexed with the third Src homology (SH3) domain of the Fyn or Hck
tyrosine kinases has been solved (Arold et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1996).
Additionally, the solution structure of Nef either alone or bound to a peptide from
the CD4 cytoplasmic tail has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
(Grzesiek et al., 1996a; Grzesiek et al., 1996b). These studies show that the core
of HIV-1 Nef consists of a type II polyproline helix (aa70--77) which represents the
main binding site for the Src family kinases. This domain is followed by two alpha
helices (aa 81--120), a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet (aa 121--186), and two
additional alpha helices (aa 187--203). Residues 60--71 and 149--180 form flexible
solvent-exposed loops. The three proximal helices of the Nef core domain (aa 70--120)
form a cavity theoretically accessible to drugs, and compounds binding this crevice
would probably disrupt interactions between Nef and Src family kinases.
<P>
The NMR structure of a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of Nef has
been recently obtained. This region forms a well-ordered alpha-helix from residues 6
to 22, with the N- and C-terminal regions having a less ordered structure (Barnham
et al., 1997). 
<P>
<b>CD4 and MHC class I downregulation: Variations on the same theme?</b>
<P>
CD4 downregulation is probably the best explained function of Nef (Aiken et al.,
1994; Garcia and Miller, 1991; Guy et al., 1987; Mariani and Skowronski, 1993;
Piguet et al., 1999; Rhee and Marsh, 1994). Nef alters the routing of CD4 at three
levels. First, the viral protein redirects some CD4 from the trans-Golgi network
(TGN) to the endosomal compartment. Second, it triggers the accelerated
internalization of molecules that have reached the cell surface. And third, it
targets CD4 from the endosome to the lysosome (Aiken et al., 1994; Kim et al., 1999;
Lu et al., 1998; Mangasarian et al., 1997; Piguet et al., 1998; Piguet et al., 1999;
Rhee and Marsh, 1994). 
<P>
Nef accomplishes these effects apparently by acting as a connector between the
receptor and components of the cell protein trafficking machinery. On the one hand,
Nef binds to CD4, recognizing a dileucine-based signal in the membrane proximal
region of the receptor cytoplasmic tail. For HIV-1 Nef, the CD4 binding site is
centered around residues 57--59, and extends over the proximal region of the Nef
core  (Aiken et al., 1994; Greenway et al., 1995; Grzesiek et al., 1996; Harris and
Neil, 1994; Hua and Cullen, 1997; Mangasarian et al., 1999; Rossi et al., 1996). On
the other hand, Nef recruits downstream cellular partners. Of note however, it has
so far not been possible to co-immunoprecipitate a complex containing CD4, Nef and
one of its downstream cellular partners. 
<P>
The first downstream partner of Nef is the adaptor protein complex of clathrin
coated pits (CCP), or AP. Adaptor complexes are heterotetrameric structures that
normally recruit clathrin to the cytoplasmic tail of receptors containing
endocytosis signals. An interaction between Nef and the medium chain of adaptor
complexes was demonstrated both in the yeast-two-hybrid system and in vitro with
recombinant proteins (Le Gall et al., 1998; Piguet et al., 1998). For HIV-2 Nef and
SIV Nef, this interaction required two adjacent tyrosine-based motifs in their
N-terminus (Lock et al., 1999; Piguet et al., 1998) and possibly a C-terminal
leucine-methione dipeptide (Bresnahan et al., 1999). In contrast, HIV-1 Nef
interacts with AP via a dileucine-based motif in the C-terminal region of the viral
protein (Bresnahan et al., 1998; Craig et al., 1998) and seems also to recruit the 
chain of adaptor complexes (Greenberg et al., 1998). This is an interesting example
of converging evolution, with HIV-1 and SIV Nef recruiting the same cellular protein
complex via partly distinct determinants. Nef also interacts with a subunit of the
V-ATPase that could facilitate its association with the endocytic apparatus (Lu et
al., 1998). Nef mutants defective for AP recruitment are unable to accelerate CD4
internalization, either in trans or when fused to the extracellular and
transmembrane domains of the receptor (Bresnahan et al., 1998; Craig et al., 1998;
Greenberg et al., 1998; Piguet et al., 1998). Together with the biochemical
evidence, these functional data demonstrate that adaptor complexes are major
effectors of Nef-induced CD4 downregulation. 
<P>
The second downstream cellular partner of Nef in this process is the COP I coatomer,
another macromolocular structure involved in protein sorting. The COPI coatomer has
a well known role in the ER-Golgi transport, but is also present in early endosomes
(Daro et al., 1997; Duden et al., 1991; Gu et al., 1997; Orci et al., 1993; Whitney
et al., 1995). 
<P>
Nef  interacts with the  subunit of COP I, both in vitro and in the yeast
two-hybrid system (Benichou et al., 1994). Mutating a diacidic (EE155)-based motif
in HIV-1 Nef abrogates the ability of a GST-Nef fusion protein to recruit -COP from
cytoplasmic extracts, and prevents Nef-induced CD4 lysosomal targeting (Piguet et
al., 1999). Furthermore, in a CHO cell line derivative containing a temperature
sensitive mutant of one subunit of the COP I coatomer (Guo et al., 1996), Nef is
unable to direct CD4 to lysosomes. These results suggest not only an explanation for
this step of transport but also reveal Nef as the first demonstrated endosomal cargo
for the COP I coatomer (Piguet et al., 1999). However, -COP does not seem the sole
Nef partner implicated in this process. Indeed, additional cellular proteins
strongly regulate the interaction of Nef with the COP I coatomer (Piguet et al.,
1999).  
<P>
In summary, a combination of functional, biochemical and structural analyses point
to a model in which HIV-1 Nef contains at least four distinct determinants crucial
for efficient CD4 downregulation, each carrying out one step of this process. The
N-terminal myristoylation signal directs Nef to membranes, its primary site of
action. A second domain, centered around amino acids 57 to 59, binds the CD4
cytoplasmic tail. A third motif, which includes the LL165 dipeptide, is responsible
for recruiting adaptor complexes, thereby triggering the formation of CD4-specific
CCP which rapidly internalize the receptor. The nearby DD174 dipeptide binds to a
subunit of the V-ATPase that might facilitate AP-2 recruitment. Finally, the EE155
diacidic sequence mediates the binding of Nef to COP I in endosomes, and as a result
governs the lysosomal targeting and degradation of Nef-associated CD4 molecules.
More schematically, the CD4 binding domain is concentrated in the N-terminal
flexible loop and the core domain of Nef, whereas the recruitment of the downstream
partners AP and COP I is mediated by a C-terminal flexible loop.
<P>
Recently, some light has been shed on the role of CD4 downregulation in the HIV
replicative cycle. Indeed, high levels of CD4 on the surface of HIV-producing cells
inhibit the infectivity of released virions by trapping the viral envelope. Nef, and
to a lesser extent Vpu, another CD4-downregulating protein of HIV-1, counteract this
negative effect of CD4 (Lama et al., 1999). Very high CD4 levels might even block
virion release from HIV-1 infected cells (Ross et al., 1999). Other benefits of
Nef-induced CD4 downregulation could stem from the liberation of Lck that
accompanies the binding of Nef to the CD4 cytoplasmic tail. Increased levels of free
Lck could promote T cell activation, thereby creating a milieu favorable for viral
gene expression. Finally, CD4 downregulation could prevent potentially lethal
superinfection events. Of note, these effects are not mutually exclusive, and
together might explain why Nef-induced CD4 downregulation is so well conserved
amongst primate lentiviruses.
<P>
<b>MHC class I downregulation: mysterious paths</b>
<P>
Nef induced-MHC class I downregulation is less efficient than the modulation of CD4,
and its mechanism is less well understood. A tyrosine found in the cytoplasmic tails
of HLA-A and B, but not of HLA-C, is critical for response to Nef (Le Gall et al.,
1998). In the presence of the viral protein, MHC class I is internalized more
rapidly, routed to the trans Golgi network, and ultimately degraded (Greenberg et
al., 1998; Le Gall et al., 1998; Schwartz et al., 1996). Residues in Nef essential
for MHC class I downmodulation are distinct from those necessary for CD4
downregulation (Greenberg et al., 1998; Mangasarian et al., 1999). Regions of Nef
implicated in alterating intracellular signalling pathways, such as the N-terminal
alpha-helix, the proximal acidic cluster and the proline-based repeat, are also
important for Nef-induced MHC class I regulation. In spite of this, MHC
downregulation by Nef does not seem to involve the phosphorylation of the receptor
and is not blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The AP recruiting motif of Nef
(LL165), essential for regulating CD4, is completely dispensable for MHC class I
modulation (Greenberg et al., 1998; Mangasarian et al., 1999). This data suggests
that Nef affects CD4 and MHC class I with the help of different cellular partners,
which remain to be identified.
<P>
While the mechanism of  Nef-induced MHC class I downmodulation is still uncertain,
its biological significance is better understood. Indeed, MHC I presents antigenic peptides on the cell
surface and permits the recognition and killing of cells expressing foreign proteins
by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Nef allows HIV-infected cells to evade CTL, at
least to some extent (Collins et al., 1998). Of note, Nef is unable to induce HLA-C
downregulation. This allows infected cells to escape natural killer (NK) cells that
would attack a cell completely devoid of surface MHC class I (Cohen et al., 1999).
In vivo, a strong CTL response is observed against viral epitopes (including Nef).
Nevertheless, HIV infection cannot be controlled by the immune system, suggesting
that immune evasion is crucial in the course of the disease (reviewed in (McMichael,
1998)). 
<P>
<b>Nef, kinases and signaling alterations</b>
<P>
Nef can recruit several protein kinases involved in cell signaling. For example, Nef
interacts directly with the SH3 domain of the Hck and Lyn non-receptor protein
tyrosine kinases via a conserved PxxP motif in its core domain, as demonstrated by
both structural and biochemical data (Lee et al., 1996; Saksela et al., 1995).
Another partner of Nef is the T cell-specific Lck tyrosine kinase, apparently bound
via both the N-terminus and the central region of the viral protein (Baur et al.,
1997). Nef also interacts with a member of the p-21 activated kinase (PAK) family
(Sawai et al., 1996) as well as with another yet unidentified serine/threonine
kinase, and with the theta subunit of protein kinase C (Smith et al., 1996);.
Finally Nef can recruit Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the
Rho-family GTpases, that in turn activates PAK and additional downstream effectors
of Nef including cdc42 and Rac1(Fackler et al., 1999). Several additional
signaling-involved molecules associate with HIV-1 Nef, including Raf1 and the TCR
(Hodge et al., 1998; Xu et al., 1999). Nef binding to TCR seems to induce an
up-regulation of FAS ligand, which could further contribute to HIV immune evasion by
killing cytotoxic T cells that come into contact with virus infected cells (Xu et
al., 1997).
<P>
These multiple interactions place Nef at the heart of cellular activation pathways.
Several recent studies point towards a model in which Nef sensitizes T cells to
activation via the TCR. In transgenic mice, expression of the full HIV-1 viral
genome under the control of the CD4 promoter triggered a disease reminiscent of AIDS
(Hanna et al., 1998). The major determinant of pathogenicity was Nef, which induced
the activation and hyperresponsiveness of thymocytes to anti-CD3 antibody
stimulation, thereby promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates,
including LAT and MAPK (Hanna et al., 1998). Another hint for the Nef-induced
activation of T cells came from particular SIV Nef variants that harbor amino acid
sequences resembling immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Viruses
carrying these nef alleles could replicate to high levels in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells without a need for exogenous stimulation, and could induce IL-2
production (Du et al., 1995). Similarly in human primary T lymphocytes HIV-1 Nef can
induce a state of TCR hyperresponsiveness (Schrager and Marsh, 1999; Wang et al., 2000).
Finally, in Jurkat human T lymphoid cells, the surface expression of a
CD8-Nef chimera resulted in the appearance of T cell activation markers, in the
accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, in the induction of NF-kB activity
and, ultimately, in cell death by apoptosis. In contrast, the intracytoplasmic
accumulation of the CD8-Nef chimera was accompanied by inhibition of TCR signaling
(Baur et al., 1994). This points to a spatial regulation of Nef activity. In that
respect, Nef was recently found to associate with membrane microdomains known as
rafts (Wang et al., 2000). Rafts represent discrete subdomains of the plasma
membrane that concentrate glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins,
glycosphingolipids, and mediators of T cell activation, including Lck, Fyn and LAT.
The presence of Nef in rafts is therefore most likely central to its ability to
prime the T cell for activation.
<P>
In monkeys, an SIV strain encoding a Nef protein that contained an SH2 binding
domain in its N-terminus induced lymphocyte activation in tissue culture and a
rapidly progressive disease in monkeys (Du et al., 1995).  SIV mutants
containing alterations in a central di-arginine motif involved in PAK
recruitment initially generated low levels of viremia, but quickly reverted to a
wild-type genotype and to full virulence (Sawai et al., 1996). Of note,
mutations in these residues also affect Nef-induced CD4 downregulation,
complicating the interpretation of this result. SIV strains with mutations in
the proline rich domain important for interaction with Fyn and Hck induced
opposite phenotypes in two distinct studies (Khan et al., 1998; Lang et al.,
1997). However the general trend in both animal models and in vitro experiments
support a model where Nef sensitizes T cells to an activation via their TCR,
rendering them more susceptible to efficient viral replication. 
<P>
Additionally, Nef is also able to promote the production, by HIV-1-infected
macrophages, of macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP) 1 and 1, and of an as
yet unidentified mediator of T cell activation. These chemokines then induce the
chemotaxis and activation of nearby resting T lymphocytes, facilitating their
subsequent infection (Swingler et al., 1999).
<P>
<b>Nef boosting virion infectivity</b>
<P>
In single-round infectivity assays, Nef-defective viruses produced from
CD4-negative cells are from three to ten times less infectious than wild type
particles. Additionally, Nef-mutated virions show a severe growth defect in
primary blood lymphocytes infected while resting and subsequently activated
(Miller et al., 1994; Spina et al., 1994). Nef can thus enhance the infectivity
of HIV-1 virions. At least two distinct mechanisms seem involved. First, Nef
stimulates HIV-1 infectivity in a CD4-independent manner. Second, as described
above, Nef-induced CD4 downregulation counterbalances the inhibitory effect that
high levels of cell surface CD4 can exert on virion release and envelope
incorporation (Lama et al., 1999; Ross et al., 1999). 
<P>
The CD4-independent stimulation of virion infectivity by Nef translates in a
more efficient synthesis of proviral DNA after virions penetrate target cells
(Aiken and Trono, 1995; Schwartz et al., 1995). However, the Nef requirement is
conditioned by the route of viral entry. Nef is thus completely dispensable if
HIV-1 particles are pseudotyped with the G protein of vesicular stomatitis
virus, that is, are internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis rather than
by fusion at the plasma membrane (Aiken, 1997). 
<P>
The biochemical events that underlie Nef-induced stimulation of HIV-1
infectivity are still obscure. Viruses expressing HIV-1 Nef variants mutated in
the LL165 dileucine motif are impaired for both infectivity and Nef-mediated CD4
downregulation (Craig et al., 1998). Residues necessary for association with
cellular protein kinases are also important for this effect of the viral
protein: a proximal sequence extending between amino acids 17 and 26, and the
proline-rich region in the central core of the viral protein (Baur et al., 1997;
Saksela et al., 1995). Furthermore, an arginine dipeptide involved in recruiting
PAK contributes to both CD4-dependent and CD4-independent enhancement of virion
infectivity. Interestingly, an HIV-1 strain mutated in this di-arginine motif
and unable to recruit PAK had lower levels of serine phosphorylation of matrix,
one of the main structural components of the virion (Swingler et al., 1997). 
There are also indications that a cellular kinase of the MAPK family is
incorporated into virions (Jacque et al., 1998). This kinase can induce the
phosphorylation of the viral matrix protein, which in turn might increase viral
infectivity at a point preceding the transcriptional activation of the provirus.
Moreover, virus infectivity is enhanced by treatment of cells with MAPK
stimulators, such as phorbol myristate acetate, as well as by coexpression of
constitutively active MEK (MAPK kinase). Treatment of cells with a specific
inhibitor of MAPK activation, or with a MAPK antisense oligonucleotide reduces
the infectivity of HIV-1 virions without significantly affecting virus
production (Yang and Gabuzda, 1999). 
<P>
Between 60 and 200 molecules of HIV-1 Nef are incorporated in virions, where
most are cleaved by the viral protease between residues 57 and 58 and associate
with the viral core (Kotov et al., 1999). The functional significance of Nef
cleavage is unclear, because a proteolysis-resistant mutant (WL58AA) is still
able to enhance infectivity. Moreover SIV Nef, which is not cleaved by the HIV-1
protease, can also stimulate virion infectivity (Chen et al., 1998; Freund et
al., 1994; Pandori et al., 1996; Welker et al., 1996). The exact roles of the
virion incorporation of Nef and of its cleavage by the viral protease thus need
further clarification.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>
Nef, as an important factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS, is an attractive target
not only for basic investigation, but also for drug discovery (reviewed in
(Miller and Sarver, 1995)). The structural data offer some clues as to how
inhibitory molecules could be developed. A compound that blocks the PxxP domain
of Nef would be expected to have a dually beneficial effect. Not only would
viral replication be slowed down, but infected cells would be more efficiently
recognized by the immune response. The structural analyses reveal that the
PxxP-based pocket of Nef is distinct from related cellular determinants involved
in recognizing SH3-containing proteins, as these motifs are usually constituted
of continuous amino acids (Grzesiek et al., 1996). This unique feature of Nef
could allow the development of drugs that would inhibit the viral protein while
sparing its cellular homologues.
<P>
In a more fundamental perspective, Nef is at the interface between HIV and its
host cell. Investigating the mechanisms of Nef action therefore provides
important information not only on the virus itself, but also on pathways that
govern cellular events such as protein trafficking and signal transduction. The
study of Nef can thus help to elucidate biological processes that are keys to
the homeostasis and survival of the cell.
