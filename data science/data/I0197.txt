the length of the pitch, parallel to Park Road and has a few obscured
view seats. The stand is split into two halves, the upper being older wooden
seats and the lower being newer plastic ones. The stand allows smoking. 
</P><P>Food available in the away stand, although at least
one fan give a less than positive review of the food although we found the "Pukka Pies" to be
OK. Whilst we have had reports the beer is available, on our last visit we couldn't find it !
There is Ladbrokes kiosk and the club has its own pre-match radio station Palace Radio on 1278
AM and pre-match in ground TV station.
</P><P>We stated previously that Palace Radio had terrible transmission strength and was only able to be
picked up a couple of roads from the ground, but we have been informed that it can be picked up 4 miles away now. That said the guys who run
it (volunteers) do a top job in the face of adversity.
 
Families are permitted to use the home family stand for most 
games.

drums into the ground, however on our last visit flags were permitted.

around the ground, however some areas have ticket machines (particularly
the side of the ground closest to Norwood Junction) which seem set up to
catch out fans who get to the ground early ! Elsewhere there is plenty
of free street parking.

about the clubs financial status instead of fighting. Plenty seemed to be
willing to have friendly pre/post match banter with visiting fans, although
one bunch were less than friendly when leaving the ground.
</P><P>One fan/club employee who has been singled our for special attention is a
programme seller answering to 'Sideo!'. Here's what we were told.
</P><P>.... Palace have a long term Programme Seller affectionately known as
SIDEBURNS. As an away fan you are likely to have bought your programme
from him as his pitch is on the corner the Away fans enter the ground in. He 
is the heavy bloke with 'tache and sideburns and a jacket and orange bib
which I guess will have to be surgically removed from him! He is regularly
spotted at Palace away games too. Many Palace fans will go out of their
way to buy their programmes from the great man as it is believed to be
lucky (recent seasons have disproved this theory...). During the game he
sells programmes inside the ground and you will hear chants of "SIDEO
SIDEO" go up from various parts of the ground as he passes them. He
usually greets this with a cheery wave or sometimes just a weary grin. It
is amusing to watch him at work (better entertainment than the football
anyways). He knowingly scans the crowd and once he has seen a sale will
acknowledge it with either a nod or a wink and eventually sidle up to you
to complete. A master at his trade - and yes he does operate in the away
end too during the first half and at half time, so you can have a go
too .....

can have their off days. The Police are quite good .....'
</P><P>Another said '[The stewards] have a penchant for asking you to sit down'.
</P><P>Glenn From AwayGuide said '... My experience (which albeit concerns a single incident) was of the police and stewards
forcefully removing several visiting supporters from Finland (who spoke very little English and this was their
first game in the UK) for standing up once too often. The stewards later claimed that they hard reportedly asked the
fans to sit down and calm down (they had a single warning they failed to comprehend) and that
they were unaware that they didn't speak English (despite the Awayguide photographer informing a steward
and a police officer he overheard planning their removal). Saying that, this was a single incident and
prior to this both Police and Stewards had been friendly and helpful. ....'
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Chants</H3><p>Palace have a unique variation on 'We're s**t and we know we are', which
is 'We're skint and we're one nil up !' and of course 'Glad All Over' which is both sung
by the fans as well as being belted out over the PA system when Palace score. 
</P><P></P><P>A large section of the Holmesdale stand (the one closest the Arthur Wait stand) deserve recognition,
not just for being loud, but also for their ability to invent new songs on the spur of the moment targeting
some of the more prominent visiting fans.
