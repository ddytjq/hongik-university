Multiagent Simulation
Is Helping Shed Light on Questions in Diverse Fields
Such as Archaeology and the Semiconductor Industry</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="5"><B>I</B></FONT>magine you are an archaeologist at the site
in Colorado where Native American
people lived some 1,000 years ago. In the dry, high-desert landscape, you find
evidence of families growing corn in fields alongside seasonal streams. Data
gathered from tree-ring evidence and other sources show that the corn thrived
when the rains were plentiful. But in times of scant rainfall, the corn
suffered.
So you ask yourself, "How could these people have survived the lean years? Did
they follow the rainfall? Or did they have other means of feeding
themselves when
the corn crop was sparse? Why did these people eventually abandon their
homelands
in the thirteenth century?"
</P>
<P>
Now imagine you are an economist attempting to understand the complex
behavior of
today's stock market. You would like to explore what causes investors to pick
certain stocks and why those investors often change stock-picking strategies.
Sometimes investors seem to pay more attention to the underlying
fundamentals of
a stock, considering things related to its price-to-earnings ratio and the
overall soundness of the company. But at other times, investors seem more
interested in trading trends related to the stock. They seem to ignore
fundamentals and instead buy or sell the stock because other investors are
doing
so. What causes traders to shift investment behavior?
</P>
<P>
These two areas of research questions seem unrelated. The former deals with an
early American culture that died out or dispersed sometime around A.D.1300. The
latter deals with highly technical traders in today's complex global
economy. But
these questions share some fundamental conditions. Both involve agents
attempting
to maximize their well being amid unpredictable environments. And both
cultures-early Anasazi and modern stock traders-are more clearly understood
today, thanks to the Swarm Simulation System, an artificial life software
program
first conceived by External Faculty member Chris Langton.
</P>
<P>
Langton and other Swarm pioneers at SFI developed the software package five
years
ago, basing it on computer simulation programs that had been around for thirty
years. Initial funding to develop Swarm came from The Carol O'Donnell
Foundation
and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. Early Swarm simulations
focused
on natural phenomena such as the behavior of bugs and explored questions
such as
how individual ants that were foraging for food were able to cooperate to
nourish
the queen and her offspring. Other early uses of Swarm modeled nuclear-fission
chain reactions and similar scientific phenomena that were relatively well
understood.</P>
<P>
Langton says the impetus for further Swarm software development came from
researchers who needed some technique to bridge the gap between theory and
observation. The scientific method requires that researchers be able to test
their theories to see if they can be proven false. But traditional research
often
affords scientists only a top-down view of what they are studying.
Scientists can
examine an ancient human settlement after it has been abandoned or a Black
Monday
stock-market crash after the traders have gone home, leaving a trail of ticker
tape on the market floor. But scientists typically have been unable to look at
those events from the bottom up, as they are happening.
</P>
<P>
It's like a police detective who is called to the scene of a burglary and
finds a
broken window and disheveled house. The detective has to piece together a
series
of events. But imagine what it would be like if the detective could turn the
clock back to one minute before the crime and watch the events unfold. Solving
the crime would be a lot easier. In a way, Swarm allows scientists to turn back
the clock to watch events unfold. Scientists using Swarm attempt to recreate
initial conditions in the software package and then let the computer simulate
what might happen.

So instead of looking at an archaeological site 700 years after it was
abandoned
or at a stock market after the day's trading is over, Swarm allows
researchers to
start from the beginning and watch the agents as they interact with their
environments. The researchers can plug in variables affecting those
environments-such as rainfall patterns or the initial price of a stock-and then
let the software run multiple iterations to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
"If you talk about the Dow Jones average or about biological evolution or an
ecosystem in the rain forest, it is difficult to do experiments," Langton says.
"You can't go back to Black Monday and change something and run it again. It is
difficult or impossible to bring the phenomenon within the scope of
experiment."
</P>
<P>
Swarm has shown such promise at shedding light on research questions that it is
now being used by some seventy-five academic and nonprofit sites and several
score of businesses. Swarm has also attracted recent support from
businesses and
government for continuing development efforts, and there is substantial
interest
from companies in using Swarm on domain-specific problems.
</P>
<P>
The software package is helping private companies like Texas Instruments
plan for
competition in semiconductor sales. It is helping California researchers
understand how forests reemerge after intense logging activity. A recent
conference of Swarm users drew people from Johns Hopkins University, Coopers &
Lybrand, Yellowstone National Park, the Naval Air Warfare Center, the Danish
Hydraulic Institute, Sandia National Labs, and TRW Inc., among other businesses
and institutions. "Business needs something like this," Langton says. "This is
the way business sees the world. They see the world as particles, as
players. You
can't just talk about the paper industry for example, because individual
players
make a huge difference."
</P>

<font size="1" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>Explosive Next
Phase</B></font><BR><BR>
These are exciting times for Swarm. After the Santa Fe Institute's initial
three-year research charter for
Swarm ran out in September, SFI's directors agreed to fund the program for
another year. Swarm 1.0 is
available for download off the Internet, and a new version that is
compatible with Windows operating
systems is now available. SFI has made the Swarm software available at no
cost to the public, expecting
the community of users to grow, assist each other in the process of using
Swarm and expand its uses, and
produce additional software to improve its functionality and applicability.

<B>A simple model of a market in a single commodity has been ported to
Swarm. This is a

The market consists of 100 agents buying and selling a commodity on the
basis of their current predictions of what direction the stock's value will
go in.
The value of the dividend (the black line at the bottom) is changing randomly
overtime--this in turn causes the price of the stock (in red) to fluctuate as
agents revalue the stock. The blue line plots the fundamental value of the
stock.

"With the completion of the initial phase of software development," says Erica
Jen, SFI's vice-president for academic affairs, "the critical question is
how to
create a structure with the flexibility and fiscal solidity to support what we
expect to be an explosive next phase of Swarm development." The new structure,
proposed by Swarm researchers and approved by the SFI Science Steering
Committee,
consists of three components: Swarm.edu will include the network of researchers
throughout the general scientific community developing Swarm-based simulations.
Swarm.org will organize around a highly distributed and loosely coordinated
network for core software development as well as domain-specific efforts. And
Swarm.com will be a for-profit company spun off from SFI for private contract
work using the Swarm platform.
</P>
<P>
Institute officials envision swarm.org as the hub for future general-purpose
software development. Future Swarm-based scientific research will involve both
swarm.org and swarm.edu. The core software-development component of swarm.org
will be maintained at SFI, with the domain-specific components (extensions to
other platforms, templates for specific research domains, Geographical
Information Systems capabilities, et cetera) to involve the participation of
multiple-research groups including, for example, those at the University of
Michigan and New Mexico State University (NMSU). "We believe it will prove
to be
of mutual benefit to Swarm and SFI for the Institute to serve as the physical
home for the platform's core software development," Jen says. "Swarm has
demonstrated the potential to be an important tool for a wide range of research
in agent-based systems and applications, and SFI has a vested interest in
stimulating this research widely.
</P>

<P>
Swarm has also proven to be a significant attractor for members of the SFI
Business Network. Continued proximity of Swarm to SFI will help maintain
and grow
those relationships."

<font size="1" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>Seeing the Effects of Individual
Players</B></font><BR>
<P>
Swarm is gaining new converts in the business and academic communities among
researchers who have recognized its potential to help shed light on complex
interdisciplinary problems. For example, Langton and his team are entering
into a
partnership with the Physical Science Laboratory at NMSU. Mike Coombs, who
directs network mathematical modeling for the Las Cruces-based laboratory, sees
Swarm as a potential catalyst for linking researchers in various institutions
along the Rio Grande corridor of New Mexico. Because Swarm is such a flexible
research tool, Coombs says, it can be shared among various disciplines that
otherwise would lack a common language for communicating. "One of Chris
Langton's
strengths is the ability to bring people together, and he is kind of inside
Swarm," says Coombs. "He's one of the most unjudgmental people I've ever come
across."
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the NMSU laboratory conducts mathematical research for the
U.S. Department of Defense related to the way troops adapt to changing
circumstances on the battlefield. The army wants to know how much local
decision-making power troops on the ground should be given and how much of that
decision-making power should remain in the hands of commanding officers. Coombs
says researchers at his laboratory would like to use Swarm for the next
phase of
this study-where mathematical metrics are applied to computer simulations
of the
battle field. Swarm also would be useful in helping laboratory researchers
model
the way governing bodies along the Rio Grande corridor make crucial decisions
regarding the allocation of water and other scarce resources, Coombs says.
</P>
<P>
The power of Swarm is that it allows researchers to see the effects of
individual
players. Traditional techniques of scientific study tend to sum over the
effects
of individuals and deal solely with course-grained approximations of the big
picture. But for Langton, the most profound events affecting a world like the
stock market or a population of early American people are often individual
agent-based events that would be missed by ordinary big-picture research.
</P>
<P>
Langton admits his computer simulation software is not particularly unique.
"People have been doing this stuff since the 1960s," he says. But what
appears so
special about Swarm is some of the assumptions underlying the software program.
Those assumptions about the value of individual actions have driven Langton and
co-researchers such as Glen Ropella, David Hiebeler, and Roger Burkhart to
spend
years painstakingly developing a software system that provides a more realistic
simulation of local events than what had been available. The Swarm simulation
allows agents to interact with their environments in subtle ways that can bring
about enormous changes.
</P>
<P>
One fundamental assumption behind Swarm is that most real-life systems
behave in
a nonlinear fashion and hence cannot be modeled using traditional
techniques. For
example, in traditional Newtonian physics, an object will always behave the
same.
The rules governing the behavior of that object will not change. Objects in
traditional physics cannot adapt their behavior according to changes around
them.
But adaptive behavior is essential to the well being of most complex real-world
agents. Darwin's model of evolution, for example, is predicated on the simple
notion that organisms change to maximize their well being in a changing
environment. The Swarm software allows for complex adaptive behavior among
evolving agents and environments, whether they are Anasazi families, troops on
the battlefield, or traders on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Langton ascribes to a basic paradigm of complexity science-major events occur
when a system is driven to the cusp between relatively stable conditions and
chaotic ones. For example, subtle changes in initial conditions can cause
carbon
molecules to fall to one side of the cusp to form graphite or to another
side to
form a diamond. Likewise, one or two traders can become nervous about a stock.
This can cause virtually no change in its final price or, at the other
extreme, a
sell-off that leads to a market crash. In most cases, individual actions will
cancel each other, hence heading off a crash. But in some instances, small
agent-based events ripple through the system causing a profound change in
outcome. Swarm allows programmers to run repeated tests, each time varying
slightly the initial parameters, to see what can cause these profound changes.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the era of fast computing, it would have been impossible to model each
agent in a population of millions. It also would have been impossible to run
billions of iterations to find that unique set of circumstances that would set
off a profound change. But as Langton says, there are no shortcuts toward
understanding complex systems such as the economy. "The more complex the system
it is," he adds, "the more you have to let it run to see what it will do."
</P>
<P>
But Langton also points out that most of the code governing the interactions of
different agents in different environments is the same regardless of the
agent or
environment. Whether you have 10,000 ants or 10,000 traders in an economy, you
still have 10,000 things whose interactive behavior is 99 percent similar. It's
only in that one percent region where the computer code must be modified to
differentiate between ants, Anasazi people, and stock traders.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Swarm provides a basic library of algorithms that can be modified to fit
specific test situations. For example, a neural-network type of
architecture may
best describe one stage of an environment while another may be more suitably
described by a genetic algorithm. Swarm is robust enough to allow these
multiple
descriptors to mix in the same model. Swarm also allows multiple tiers of
interaction within a world being studied. For example, interactions can occur
among various factories in an industry and, at the same time, among various
workstations within each factory.</p>
<P>
Langton's goal for Swarm is to provide a generic software that can be
applicable
to various agents and environments with just minor programming variations. But,
he acknowledges, "We have a ways to go with it."
</P>
<P>
Swarm derives computational power from its bold postmodern philosophical
assumptions about the relationship between an agent and his environment.
Both are
treated equally, in contrast to the traditional human-centered worldview in
which
an environment is a passive, undefined space and an agent is an active and
discrete entity. The old spatial metaphor that has a smart agent engulfed in a
dumb environment does not apply. The lattice of agents and environments in a
Swarm program allocates equal powers to the ant and the earth, the Anasazi
family
members and the climate in which they live, the stock trader and the market.
Animated life is not privileged over inanimate dimensionality. Each acts
upon the
other, and the boundaries between where an agent stops and its environment
begins
are blurred.
</P>

<font size="1" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>Challenges and
Enthusiasm</B></font><BR><BR>
<P>
Despite its successes, Swarm faces challenges. Langton says current versions of
Swarm rely on a simulated parallel-processing system. SFI researchers now are
working on a system that would more closely resemble the real world by using
multiple computers operating in parallel. A parallel kernel also will allow
faster computation as Swarm models become more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
While Swarm offers insights into research questions by permitting a bottom-up
approach, the Swarm architecture is still subject to the same limitations that
govern statistical econometric curve fitting-the traditional type of top-down
research. To build an informative Swarm simulation, a researcher must carefully
select the important variables governing the system to avoid specification
errors. This challenge is not trivial. The Anasazi model, for example,
would not
be meaningful if programmers did not realize that the caloric requirement of
residents in the community was the fundamental systemic variable.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Hanson, manager of mixed-signal application for specific products at
Texas
Instruments in Dallas, says his company has used Swarm to look for competitive
advantages in the semiconductor industry. He is also considering a Swarm
study of
new product applications in digital-signal processing. But Hanson says
Swarm will
have to become easier to use before it catches on widely in the business
community. Texas Instruments is in the early adopter stage of Swarm, he
says, in
part because it still requires good software engineering expertise. Hence,
"People outside the computer science labs tend not to be interested."
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/swarm_c.gif" ALT="swarm" ALIGN="right">
But those researchers who have become comfortable with Swarm have found it
invaluable. Tim Kohler, chairman of the department of anthropology at
Washington
State University, says Swarm has fully lived up to his expectations. The
simulation software has led to intriguing insights into the ways in which early
Native American peoples coped with changes in their environments. Swarm has
corroborated theories suggesting that Anasazi cultures developed maize trading
among households to contend with variable patterns of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
In the Swarm Artificial Anasazi model, the terrain of Southern Colorado 1,000
years ago shows up on the computer as a green topographical map, crisscrossed
with streambeds. Families show up as pixels of light. The model simulates life
among the people using some thirty variables-birth rates, death rates, local
topography, corn-storage potential, rainfall, and the like. The computer races
through each year in a matter of about ten seconds, allowing researchers to
tweak
one or two variables and rerun the model to see what changes occur. Researchers
then study the survival rates among the pixels representing families.
</P>
<P>
Kohler and co-researcher Carla Van West have found that families tended to be
risk averse. They would share maize with other families in exchange for a
promise
to return the favor. But sharing was more prevalent in times of high overall
productivity across the entire region when productivity also varied from
year to
year and local area to local area. But when the entire region suffered from low
maize productivity, families tended to hoard.
</P>
<P>
Research on the Artificial Anasazi project suggests that environmental
degradation forced the people to abandon their homes in the thirteenth century.
But the Swarm model also suggests that one-third of the population could have
survived if they had redistributed themselves on the land.
</P>
<P>
Kohler is excited to be going on sabbatical next year, when he hopes to use
Swarm
to research other questions about the Anasazi people. He wants to find out how
variations among local conditions rather than among regional ones affect
sharing
behavior among the virtual Anasazi population and how sharing rules change over
time. He says Swarm overall has been widely accepted among the archaeological
community. "There is a great deal of enthusiasm for it," Kohler says, "and a
number of people have told me that they are very interested in this project."
