<h1>Watkins Glen International</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Watkins Glen is a 3.45 mile road course
located near Watkins Glen, New York, at the south end of Seneca Lake.
<p>
Watkins Glen has hosted a remarkable variety of races over the
years, including most of the various IMSA series, most of the various
<a href="../scca/">
SCCA
</a>
series, Formula 1, Indycar, and NASCAR Winston Cup.
<p>
Pro races make up a very small part of the Watkins Glen Schedule;
one SCCA National race and a large number of SCCA regionals occur
at the track during the course of a year, as well as a large number
of Club Dates put on by organizations such as the Porsche Club of
America, the BMW Car Club of America, and so forth.
<p>
Watkins Glen has their own web page at
<a href="http://www.theglen.com/">http://www.theglen.com</a>.

<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">
Short History of Road Racing at Watkins Glen</a></h2>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
Road Racing came to Watkins Glen in 1948; the projected was initiated
by Cameron Argetsinger, an Ohio resident who often stayed at his
father's summer house on Seneca Lake.  Argetsinger, an early member
of the <a href="../scca/">SCCA</a>,
proposed a an amateur Road Race to be called the "Watkins Glen Grand
Prix" to the Watkins Glen Chamber of Commerce.  The Chamber was
enthusiastic; Argetsinger selected a 6.6 mile course using paved,
gravel, and dirt roads, permissions were obtained to close a NYC
railroad track and the roads needed, and SCCA sanction was obtained.
The first race was held at 12 Noon on October 2nd, 1948, a 4 lap
qualifying race with a standing start.  Subsequently, 15 cars
started the 8 lap, 52.8 mile Grand Prix, and 10 finished.  The winner
was Frank Griswold, of Wayne, Pennsylvania, in a pre-war Alfa Romeo
8C2900 coupe, closely followed by Briggs Cunningham in his infamous
Bu-Merc.  Other prominent entrants included William Milliken, the
noted Aircraft and Race Vehicle dynamics expert-to-be (who rolled
his Bugatti 35 on the last lap of the qualifier, giving "Milliken's
Bend" its name), Charles Addams, the cartoonist who created the
Addams' Family, and Miles and Sam Collier, major figures in
the early history of US Road Racing (it should be noted that
Milliken and Argetsinger were original members of the first SCCA
Competition Board, holding competition licenses numbers 6 and 1,
respectively.  Milliken wrote the actual supplemental regulations
for the first Watkins Glen race.)
<p>
The 1949 Grand Prix was won by Miles Collier in a Ford-Riley, narrowly
defeating Briggs Cunningham in a Ferrari.  The 1950 Race (the first
on the FIA calendar, via the AAA contest board), brought tragedy to
Wakins Glen for the first time.  Sam Collier was killed when his
car fishtailed and rolled during the race; his brother Miles never
raced again.  Later in the day, a car left the road, injuring a
fireman and two spectators.
<p>
Change started in 1951; there was a need to spend real money on
a communication system, and gain better control of the spectators.
After some debate, it was decided to continue with SCCA sanction
rather than switching to AAA sanction.  The 1951 race was relatively
uneventful after that; it was won by George Weaver of Boston in
a blue-and-white Cunningham, narrowly defeating John Fitch
in another blue-and-white Cunningham.
<p>
1952 was the last year of the original circuit that passed through
the center of town; spectator control and money problems had
been mounting, and change was clearly the order of the day.
This point was brought home when for the second time, tragedy
struck at Watkins Glen: in a 3 lap trial prior to the main race
of the day, a car left the course on the start-finish straight
in town, entering the crowd.  12 spectators were injured and 1 died.
The day's race schedule was abruptly halted, and never completed;
the race would never pass through town again.
<p>
<h3>The Second Course</h3>
In response to the events in the 1952 Watkins Glen Grand Prix, the
State of New York imposed new policies forbidding racing on state
highways; this effectively ended racing on the original circuit.
After some searching, a location was selected in the Town of Dix,
on the top of a hill to the southwest of town.  A 4.6 mile course was
selected using existing Town roads, agreements were reached with
surrounding land owners, and a lease agreement was signed with the
Town.  the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation was formed by the
Chamber of Commerce to manage the race.  George Weaver and William
Milliken were consulted and the roads that had been selected were
improved prior to the race.  Spectator control, parking and concessions
were all dramatically improved at the new site.  However, the SCCA
choose not to sanction the 1953 Watkins Glen Grand Prix.
<p>
The actual race was won by Walt Hansgen in a Jaguar XK120C; second
place went to George Harris in an Allard.  There were no major
incidents in the race.  In light of the relative safety of the
new circuit, the SCCA choose to renew sanction for the 1954 and
1955 races.  The 1954 race was won by Phil Walters in a Cunningham C4R.
Trouble surfaced in 1955; it became clear that it would not be
reasonable to continue using closed public roads that doubled as
farm roads, and the drivers expressed concern about poor runoff and
poor visibility.  The decision was made to build a permanent road
course, and the 9th Watkins Glen Grand Prix would be held in 1956 on
an all new race course.  Thus, the second course only lasted 3 years.

<h3>The Third Course</h3>

The new race course was located on a 550 acre parcel which overlapped
part of the second race course; however, no roadways were shared,
as entirely new roads were built for the new circuit.  Bill Milliken
was consulted on the new course, and several engineering professors
from Cornell laid out the new circuit and specified the pavement.
The new course would be 2.3 miles long.  The new course was completed
the night before the first practice.  The SCCA had changed management,
and the race promotors were not able to come to terms on a race
sanction; the race went forward without one.  A press release turf war
followed, with the race eventually going on anyway, despite an effort
by the SCCA to get its drivers to withdraw.  The 9th Watkins Glen
Grand Prix went off without serious incidents.
<p>
The Grand Prix committee decided to hold a "get together" race
at the circuit on October 20th and 21st; the turf war continued
as the SCCA announced a ban on SCCA driver participation.  The
race was held anyway, with a small but friendly turnout.
The turf war burned out; the SCCA inspected the circuit, asked
for a small and reasonable list of changes, and and in early 1957
formed the Glen region of the SCCA.  The Watkins Glen Grand Prix
committee made all the requested changes and more; the SCCA ban
was lifted, peace was restored, and on July 5th and 6th, the
Glen region put on the First Annual Glen Classic SCCA Regional.
<p>
The 10th Watkins Glen Grand Prix subsequently occured on the traditional
3rd Saturday of September, 1957, with Cameron Argetsinger as SCCA Chief
Steward.  There were over 225 entries, and no serious incidents.
The Grand Prix was won by Walt Hansgen in a D Type Jaguar; fast
lap was set by second place finisher Bob Holbert in a Porsche RS.
<p>
In 1957, Watkins Glen was visited by NASCAR for the first time,
as the Grand National Division (which eventually became NASCAR
Winston Cup) appeared.  Beginning in 1961, the US Grand Prix
was held at Watkins Glen for 19 years.
<p>
In 1981, Watkins Glen filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors;
in 1983 the facility was purchased by a division of Corning Glass,
who reopened the track in 1984.  Since then, Corning has sold a major
share in the track to NASCAR.
<p>
<h3>The Fourth Course - Entering the Modern Era</h3>
The fourth course is basically the course which exists today.
The "short course" follows the rough outlines of the third course,
with turns 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to turns 1, 2, and 3 of the
third course.  Turn 5 ("the Loop") corresponds to turn 4 on the
final version of the third course.  Turn 6 of the short course
(turn 10 of the long course) is a dramatic (and rather tighter)
revision of the third course turn 5; the remainder of the fourth
course is distinctly different from the third course, relocating
pit lane and the pit straight (the relocation of pit lane triggered
the turn renumbering for those parts of the third course that were
retained in the fourth course.)
<p>
A chicane known as the "Inner Loop" was added in the early 1990s after
the tragic death of NASCAR Winston Cup driver J. D. McDuffie in a
Turn 5 accident; this chicane was added on the right side of the
back straightaway, just before the entrance to "The Loop".  It is
numbered as 4 distinct turns (Turns 5, 6, 7, and 8), although it
is generally taken as two turns.  When the chicane is used, 4 is
added to the turn numbers for all subsequent turns on the course.

Elevation View, Fourth Course
</a>
<p>
The elevation view dates from before the addition of the new chicane on
the back straightaway.  In interpreting these maps, note that the
course direction is clockwise, that is, the infield is to the driver's
right.  Turn 1 is the first turn after Start/Finish (the extreme left end
of the map). Turns 2, 3, and 4 are the Esses, leading to the back straight.
The chicane which appears at the end of the back straight on the elevation
map is the old "SCCA chicane" which is no longer used; it does not
correspond to the new "Inner Loop" which appears on the Vertical View.
Turn 5 is "The Loop", which may feed either the long course or the short
course.
<p>
The long course consists of an addition refered to as the "Boot";
the driver on the long course takes a different, wider line through
"The Loop", following a short downhill straight into the lefthander
known as "The Chute" (long course Turn 6); the track levels off somewhat
and then enters a long, banked, climbing hairpin called "the Toe of
the Boot" (long course Turn 7), and a goes up a steep hill onto
a short straight; this is followed by a right hander of slightly
more than 90 degrees called "the Heel of the Boot" (long course
turn 8).  A short straight ensues, followed by a left hander
of more than 90 degrees called "the Off Camber" (long course
turn 9), which rejoins the short course between short course
turns 5 and 6 (long course turns 5 and 10).

<h2><a name="GettingThere">Getting to Watkins Glen</a></h2>
<h3>From Albany, NY</h3>
<h4>Towing</h4>
Take I-88 west to Binghampton; take NY 17 west from there.
In Elmira/Horseheads, turn right off of NY 17 onto NY 14 North.
Take NY 14 North to Montour Falls.  Most of the accomodations
are further North just off of 14; to reach the track, you
may also turn left in Montour Falls and follow the "Race Track"
signs up the hill.  Alternatively, you may simply take 14 North
and then turn Left onto NY 414 in Watkins Glen.  Climbing the
hill sucks either way.  The two roads meet at a traffic light
at the top of the hill; WGI is to the north (go straight from
here if you are on the Montour Falls road; turn right if you
are on NY 414.)  Head on up the hill to the race track, which will
be on your left.  For marque club dates, enter at the first turn;
for SCCA events, head further up the hill to the registration building.
<p>
<h4>Not Towing</h4>
A more scenic route than the above is possible, but it is only about
15 minutes shorter.  It is a very poor choice of route to tow on, though.
<p>
Take I-88 west to Bainbridge (Exit 8.)  Take NY 206 from Bainbridge
to I-81; when you reach I-81, switch to NY (mumble) towards Ithaca.
Leaving Ithaca, turn onto NY (mumble) towards Watkins Glen.  Follow
NY (mumble) until it ends in a T intersection at the foot of a long
hill; turn left at the T onto NY (mumble) and follow this road into
Watkins Glen.  In Watkins Glen, turn left at a traffic light onto
NY 14.  Turn right at a traffic light onto NY 414 and at the top of
the hill, turn right at a traffic light towards WGI and head up the hill.
<p>
<h3>From the NYC area</h3>
Take NY 17 west, and use the Albany/Towing instructions once you get
past Binghampton.
<p>
<h2><a name="RacersGuide">A Racers' Guide to Watkins Glen</a></h2>
<h3>Registration</h3>
Registration is generally near the top of the hill on the east side of
the track, on Bronson Hill Road.
The Driver/Crew line generally is at the front of the building,
and the Worker/Official line generally is around to the side.
<h3>Entry</h3>
Once registered, turn right (downhill) on to the road you took
to Registration, and head down to the first gate you passed on the
way up the hill.  Turn right to enter the track.  Display your
credentials to the track employees at the gate, and enter the
track.  Pass through the tunnel under the Esses.  Continue straight
through the 4 way stop, and through the 2 way stop.  Open
Paddock space will be all around you, the garages and pits straight
ahead.  There is additional paved paddock space on the far side
of the garage.
<h3>Garages</h3>
Space in the garage is generally rented; ask about it at registration.
The bays closest to the Pits are reserved for Tech Inspection.
<h3>Fuel</h3>
The fuel pumps are next to the Tech Bays near the garage area.
<h3>Tech Inspection</h3>
During safety tech, the path through the Tech inspection starts on
the track side of the garage.  For gear checks, enter and go to
one of the tables on this side of the garage.  The inspector will
approve your gear and send you to the table on the other side of
the garage to get your log book stamped and recieve your tech sticker.
<p>
For full techs, bring your car to the track side of the garage, and
enter from this side when space is available.  You may wish to have
your gear check done separately while waiting for space for the rest
of a full tech.  Again, once you complete the required tech inspection,
go to the table on the other end to have your logbook stamped and
recieve your tech sticker.
<p>
The scales are located in the Tech bay on the side away from the
track.  If the area is clear, enter from the side away from the
track.  Do not attempt to do so if annual techs are in progress,
however.  It is unlikely that scales will be available if any
form of Impound is in progress.
<h3>False Grid</h3>
The False Grid is behind the Pits, at the far end from the
Garage and Tower.  Note that Pit Marshalls at Watkins Glen wear
red shirts, and are quite serious about directing traffic in the
area between the Fuel Pumps, the Garages, the Pits, and the Tower.
<h3>Impound</h3>
Upon leaving the track, impound for the top finishers (or sometimes
all cars for compliance efforts) starts on the side of the garage
away from the Track.  You will be directed into the garage bay where
the scales are located, and then may be directed to stop after leaving
the scales for compliance checks.  After clearing the Tech bays,
impounded cars are parked in a pyloned off area between the garage
and the track.  This is adjacent to the gravel area where disabled
cars are placed by the wreckers for Post Accident Scrutineering.
<p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>
Watkins Glen has recently made major upgrades to their water supply; the
situation is vastly improved over years past.
