              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Coaches
              tend to get myopic vision when it comes to where they put their
              emphasis in producing winning teams.&nbsp; Without any question
              the best selling books and videos on the market are about a
              &quot;successful coaches&quot; X's and O's.&nbsp;&nbsp; However if
              you read between the lines you will almost certainly know that
              successful coaching is a lot more than simply having a vast
              knowledge of court tactics.&nbsp; Jeff Janssen is one of America's
              leading sport performance specialist from the University of
              Arizona where he has worked as a consultant to many of Arizona's
              National Championship including Lute Olsen's Basketball and
              Softball Coach Mike Candrea's teams.&nbsp; Dr. Greg Dale similarly
              works as a Sport Psychology consultant with Duke University in
              their Department of Health, Physical Education and Recreation and
              many of their athletic teams.&nbsp; Both are uniquely qualified
              clinicians with broad experiences dealing with mental aspects of
              coaching the game.&nbsp; They have presented at more than 500 peak
              performance clinics around the country and are recognized as two
              of the best in the business.</span></font></p>
              <h3 style="text-align:justify"><font color="#FF9900" size="1">It
              Takes One to Know One</font></h3>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
              authors could have taken the easy road and just written what
              they&nbsp; &quot;know&quot; about successful coaching based on
              their experiences and training.&nbsp; But any good scholar knows
              to ask the question how do you know what you know?&nbsp; And if
              you don't know you better find out.&nbsp; So Janssen and Dale went
              on the road to interview some of today's most successful coaches
              including: Mike Krzyzewski (Duke-basketball), Gail Goestenkors
              (Duke-women's basketball), Roy Williams (Kansas-basketball), Pat
              Summit (Tennessee-women's basketball), Dr. Leroy Walker (US
              Olympic track coach), Jerry Welsh (Milwaukee Bucks) and many other
              of arguably the best coaches of this generation. The answers they
              got from our perspective add considerable weight to the content
              and credibility of this book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all the coaches
              interviewed are from the basketball community. But they all have
              one thing in common, years of coaching success.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The results of Janssen and Dale's work is a powerfully written,
              intriguing look at what many coaches are missing on the road to
              success.&nbsp;&nbsp; We like their approach.&nbsp; After reading
              Seven Secrets you will some away with some tangible things you can
              work on as a coach to improve your chances of success on the
              court.</span></font></p>
              <h3 style="text-align:justify"><font color="#FF9900" size="1">Coercion
              Is A Dead Horse</font></h3>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
              book begins with a summary of some basics about what it takes to
              be a successful coach.&nbsp; The essence of this chapter is that
              it takes more than X's and O's to win.&nbsp; Without the respect
              of your athletes all the tactics in the world will not make you a
              winner.&nbsp; With that said, <i>Seven Secrets</i> proceeds <img border="0" src="../../../../images/reviews/because_of_their_style.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">in
              Chapter 2 to teach us how to win respect by being a credible
              coach.&nbsp; Some coaches attempt to win respect by coercion.&nbsp;
              This worked more two or three generations before but in today's
              modern game a coach must earn that respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; A critical
              point is made when Janssen and Dale state &quot;earning your
              athletes respect does not mean that you are trying to get them to
              like you.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this second chapter there is also
              an interesting table which compares traits of &quot;coercive&quot;
              vs. &quot;credible&quot; coaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, coercive
              coaches criticize and torture, while credible coaches challenge
              and teach.&nbsp; Throughout this book there are &quot;chocolate
              chips&quot; of quotes from many of these great coaches sprinkled
              in to add emphasis to specific points they make.&nbsp; In this
              chapter John Wooden is quoted as saying &quot;Pride is a better
              motivator than fear.... I never want to teach through fear.&quot;</span></font></p>

              isn't just enough to begin to understand what being a credible
              coach means.&nbsp; Chapter Three takes you through the benefits of
              becoming a credible coach.&nbsp; As Brian Billick of the Baltimore
              Ravens football team is quoted as saying, &quot;as your
              credibility as a leader rises, your followers will be more likely
              to respond in a positive manner to your coaching.&quot;&nbsp; This
              chapter shows that credible coaching impacts and improves;
              increases motivation and commitment, improves the coachability of
              your players, team discipline, athlete's confidence, recruiting,
              and in the end your win-loss record.&nbsp; As a result of these
              benefits you will be more satisfied in your coaching position and
              more likely to avoid burnout and take away from your job more
              positive experiences.</span></font></p>

              experience.&nbsp; Janssen and Dale provide a &quot;Credible

              people you have admired and respected over the years and to

              Chapter 6, asks you the question &quot;Could you player for
              yourself&quot;.&nbsp; One particular quote we found very pointed
              came in Chapter 5 from North Carolina's Women's Soccer Coach Anson
              Dorrance (winner's of numerous NCAA Championships).&nbsp; He talks
              about how young coaches must get through the &quot;survival
              stage&quot; of coaching in the first decade in their
              careers.&nbsp; Unfortunately he says &quot;one of the great
              mistakes that all young coaches make as they are entering the
              profession is the feeling they have to be liked.&nbsp; And what
              ends up happening is they end up trying to win a popularity
              contest, and they end up sacrificing the respect of the
              team.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

              beginning on the path to becoming a credible coach you must have a
              truthful perspective of what type of coach you are.&nbsp; These
              chapter's will help you evaluate where you are as a coach at this
              time in your career.&nbsp; Chapter 6 includes a Credibility
              assessment test for both you and your athletes to help determine
              your areas of weakness and strength.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

              &quot;character is who you really are, reputation is what you are
              perceived to be.&quot;&nbsp; There is also a section on ethics in
              coaching which is well worth your reading.&nbsp; How can you

              &quot;seed of success&quot; in their heads is not something to be

              in this chapter on 12 steps to challenge your athletes on the
              court yet help them maintain their confidence.&nbsp; Today's
              athletes need more attention, have more fragile psyche's and need

              12 is all about improving your ability to communicate with your
              players.&nbsp; How do you connect with your players? Rick Pitino
              is quoted as saying &quot;so much of good leadership rests on your
              ability to get your message across.&quot;&nbsp; Any coach worth
              their weight in salt knows that if you can't get your players to
              buy into your system and way of thinking you will never be able to
              achieve success. This chapter emphasizes a positive approach,
              knowing as much how to say something as what you say, and
              communicating before, during and after competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

              13 is about the last of the Seven Secrets, consistency.&nbsp;
              Winning coaches are consistent yet flexible when situations
              require it.&nbsp; A coach must learn to manage their moods,
              control their emotions and be consistent with
              discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an excellent section in this
              chapter on rules regarding use of rules by coaches.&nbsp; They
              state rule #1 is discipline begins with you, rule #2 the fewer the
              rules the better, and rule #3 hold everyone accountable, and
              finally rule #4 there are no doghouses.&nbsp; We suspect that the
              downfall of many coaches is their inconsistency in dealing with
              disciplinary measure which can be in part based on any or all of
              these basic rules.&nbsp; It is well worth your time to read this
              section more than once.</span></font></p>

              the game is more than about them and their time on this
              earth.&nbsp; It is about who they impact, how they influence and
              change the course of their players lives.&nbsp; It is much more

            improve your coaching.&nbsp; It leaves you asking questions about
            your own coaching methods and skills and will challenge you to
            realize that coaches need practice too.&nbsp; Often in areas that
            are not easily measured or visibly obvious.&nbsp; Only when it is
            took late and you has lost credibility as a coach does it become
            apparent that you had a flaw in &quot;your coaching

            hoops.&nbsp; There are a lot of great X's and O's materials on the
