The car was really beat up after 2 figure 8 heats and 2 demo derby heats, but still ran o.k.
<br>
I replaced the fan belt, straightened the fan, welded the broken frame, removed most of the radiator support, removed the trunk and swapped to some legal tires.  
<br>
The radiator has a grapefruit sized hole in it.  I pinched off all of the effected rails and ran a bunch of stop leak in it.
<p>
After loading the car on the trailer, I found a trail of tranny fluid.  The rubber hose had sprung a leak, which I fixed in about a 1/2 hour
<br>
At the inspection, they wanted to know the wheel base of the car.  I'd forgotten that there was a 116" limit.  
<br>  
They measured it and found I had 4" to spare. 
<p>
In the pits, I figured out why the car was not running as good as it should.
<br>
The last race had bent one of the exhaust pipes into an L shape.  I paid some guy $10 to cut if off with his torches.
<p>
The track was smaller that I was use to, but they only ran 5-6 cars in a heat, with only the winner advancing to the final heat
<br>
Didn't win my heat, but did come in a respectable 3rd.  Had a great time driving around, spinning my wheels, and hitting people
<br>
It was nice for a change, to actually run a car 3 times and still be able to drive it on the trailer.
