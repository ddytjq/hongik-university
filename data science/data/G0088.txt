After Sir William Herschel's <a href="discovery.html">
discovery of infrared </a>
,which showed that the Sun emits infrared light, astronomers tried
to see if other objects in the universe gave out infrared waves.  In 1856,    
astronomers used thermocouples (devices which convert heat into electric
current) to detect infrared radiation from the Moon. 
Much later, in 1948 (decades before the first Moon landing),
more sophisticated infrared studies of the Moon would show 
that its surface was covered with a fine powder.
In the early 1900's, infrared radiation was successfully detected from
the planets Jupiter and Saturn and from some bright stars such as Vega and
Arcturus. 
However, the insensitivity of the early infrared instruments
prevented the detection of other near-infrared sources.
Work in infrared astronomy remained at a low level until breakthroughs in
the development of new, sensitive infrared detectors were achieved in the
1960's.
<p>
<img src="hist2.gif">
<p>
During the past few decades, infrared astronomy has become a major field of 
science due to the rapid advances in infrared detector technology.  Many of
these advances arose from U.S Department of Defense research into infrared
array technology in the 1980's.

Infrared light, having longer wavelengths and lower energy than visible
light, does not have enough energy to interact with the photographic plates
which are used in visible light astronomy.  Instead infrared astronomers
rely on electronic devices to detect radiation.   Early infrared astronomers
used thermocouples and thermopiles (a group of thermocouples combined in
one cell).  
<p>
In the 1950's astronomers started to use Lead-sulphide (PbS) detectors       
to study infrared radiation in the 1 to 4 micron range.  When infrared light 
in this range falls on a PbS cell it changes the resistance of the cell.
This change in resistance can be measured and is related to the amount of
infrared radiation which falls upon the cell.  To increase the sensitivity
of the PbS cell it was cooled to a temperature of 77 degrees Kelvin
by placing it in a flask filled with liquid nitrogen.  
<p>
A major breakthrough came in 1961, with the development of the germanium
bolometer.
This instrument was hundreds of times more sensitive than previous detectors
and was capable of detecting all infrared wavelengths.
Basically, a cool thin strip of germanium is placed in a container which has
a small opening in it.  When infrared radiation comes through the opening
and hits the germanium, it warms the metal and changes its conductivity
(a measure of how much electrical current flows through an object).  The
change in conductivity can be measured and is directly proportional to the
amount of infrared radiation entering the container.                         
The germanium bolometer works best at an extremely low temperature
(much lower than liquid nitrogen).
The best way to cool the bolometer to such a low temperature 
is to surround it with liquid helium which cooled it to 4 degrees Kelvin. 
This is only a few degrees above absolute zero.  To do 
this a metal Dewar (similar to a well insulated thermos
flask) was developed which was able to
hold the liquid helium in which the germanium bolometer was immersed.         
This type of infrared detector is sensitive to the entire range of infrared
wavelengths.  To study a particular wavelength of infrared emission
from astronomical objects, astronomers place filters in front of the detectors,
which filter out all but the desired wavelengths.     
<p>
Infrared detector technology continues to advance at a rapid rate.  
Astronomers now use InSb and HgCdTe detectors for the 1 to 5 micron range.
These operate in a way similar to the PbS detectors but use materials which
are much more sensitive to the infrared.
The development of infrared array detectors in the 1980's caused another
giant leap in the sensitivity of infrared observations.                     
Basically a detector array is a combination of several single detectors.
These arrays allow astronomers to produce images containing tens of thousands
of pixels at the same time.  Infrared arrays have been used on several
infrared satellite missions.  In 1983 the IRAS mission used an array of
62 detectors.  Astronomers now commonly use 256x256 arrays (thats 65,536
detectors!). 

Due to these 
breakthroughs in infrared technology, infrared astronomy has developed
more rapidly than any other field of astronomy and continues to bring us
exciting new views of the universe.

Infrared detectors attached to ground based telescopes can  
detect the near-infrared wavelengths which make it through our
atmosphere.  The best location for ground based infrared observatories
is on a high, dry mountain, above much of the water vapor which absorbs 
infrared.  At these high altitudes, astronomers can study infrared 
wavelengths centered at 1.25, 1.65, 2.2, 3.5, 4.75, 10.5, 19.5 and 35 microns.
Telescopes as well as our atmosphere emit infrared radiation which can
complicate the observation of cosmic sources.
Infrared telescopes are designed to limit the the amount of this thermal 
emission from reaching the detectors.  All ground based infrared detectors
are cooled to extremely low temperatures to reduce their emission.        
In addition, astronomers making 
ground based observations measure both the emission from the sky and from
object that they are observing.   They then subtract the sky's emission  
from the infrared emission of a celestial object to get an accurate
measurement.
<p>
In the mid-1960's, the first infrared survey of
the sky was made at the Mount Wilson Observatory using 
liquid nitrogen cooled PbS detectors which were
most sensitive at 2.2 microns.  The survey covered approximately 75
percent of the sky and found about 20,000 infrared sources.  Many of these
sources were stars which had never been seen before in visible light.
These stars were much cooler than our Sun and had surface temperatures of
1,000 degrees to 2,000 degrees Kelvin.  Our Sun has a surface temperature of
about 6,000 degrees Kelvin.  The brightest 5,500 of these sources made up the 
first catalog of infrared stars.

A partial infrared survey of the southern sky was also made in 1968 at the
Mount John Observatory in New Zealand.
</p><p>
New observatories, specializing in infrared astronomy, became possible in 
the 1960's due to advances in infrared detectors.  The largest group of
infrared telescopes can be found on top of Mauna Kea (a dormant volcano)
on the island of Hawaii.

By the early 1970s, it was found that the centers of most galaxies emit
strongly in the infrared, including our own galaxy, the Milky Way.  Quasars 
and other active galaxies were also found to be strong infrared emitters.
All of this new information came from near-infrared observations which could
be made from the ground.
Today, most of the larger ground based telescopes have been modified to
accommodate infrared detectors.  
Many ground based infrared telescopes are now using adaptive optics to 
create very sharp images.    
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/ao/">Adaptive optics</a>
removes the blurring of an astronomical image due to 
turbulence in earth's atmosphere.  
<p>
<img src="hist4.gif">
<p>
In addition to absorbing most of the infrared radiation from cosmic sources, 
the Earth's atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared which interferes with
infrared observations.
This is why it is best to get above as much of the atmosphere
as possible to observe in the infrared.  
To do this, infrared detectors have been placed on balloons, rockets and
airplanes, allowing astronomers to study longer infrared wavelengths. 
Even though
these methods can only observe a small part of the sky for short periods
of time, they have contributed much to infrared astronomy. 
<p>
<img src="rocket.gif" align="right" hspace=5>
The first cooled telescopes were those placed on rockets which could observe
the sky for several minutes before reentry.  The first infrared all sky map
resulted from a series of rocket flights by the Air Force Cambridge 
Research Laboratory.  This project, called Hi Star, surveyed the cosmos
at wavelengths of 4, 10 and 20 microns.  Although the total observation
time accumulated by these flights was only about 30 minutes, they
successfully detected 2363 reliable infrared sources which were published
in the AFCRL Infrared Sky Survey.  About 70% of these sources matched 
sources found by the Mount Wilson 2.2 micron survey.
Rockets also found bright infrared
emission from HII regions (regions of ionized hydrogen) and the center of
our galaxy.  
<p>
Helium filled, mylar balloons have carried infrared telescopes up to altitudes
as high as 25 miles.
In 1963, a germanium bolometer was attached to a balloon to make infrared
observations of Mars.
Beginning in 1966, the Goddard Institute of Space Sciences used balloons to
survey the sky at 100 microns.  Their program led to the discovery of about
120 bright infrared sources near the plane of our galaxy.

were used to discover the rings of Uranus in 1977.  The KAO has been
used to gather infrared astronomical data for over 20 years and can fly at an 
altitude of 41,000 feet which is above 99 percent of the Earth's water vapor.
In addition to being able to study additional infrared wavelengths, airborne
observatories can detect fainter infrared objects which cannot be observed
well from the ground (such as interstellar clouds).

In the 1970s, astronomers around the world began to consider the possibility
of placing an infrared telescope
on a satellite in orbit around the Earth.  This telescope would be above
the Earth's atmosphere and could view the sky at the far-infrared wavelengths
which were difficult to detect on Earth.  It could view a large area of the sky
and observe regions for a longer period of time. 
</p><p>
By 1977, an international collaboration was formed by the Netherlands,
United States and Great Britain to develop IRAS - The Infrared Astronomical 
Satellite.  The American team built the
telescope, detectors and cooling system.  The British built the satellite ground
station and control center and the Dutch team built the spacecraft which
included the on-board computers and pointing system.  
</p>
<p>
It takes a great deal of effort to build an infrared space telescope.
After many years of hard work and after overcoming several complications,
IRAS was successfully launched on January 25, 1983.  The telescope was housed
in a dewar, filled with 127 gallons of liquid helium and contained         
62 detectors.
The entire telescope was cooled to a temperature of just a few degrees 
above absolute zero because otherwise the telescope itself would
emit infrared radiation (heat) which would interfere with the observations.
A space infrared telescope must be cooler than the objects in space that it
will observe.

<p>
The IRAS mission would last as long as the liquid helium did.  For the next
ten months, IRAS scanned more than 96 percent of the sky four times, providing
the first high sensitivity all sky map at wavelengths of 12, 25, 60 and 
100 microns.
IRAS increased the number of cataloged astronomical sources by about 70%,
detecting about 350,000 infrared sources. <a href="iras_discoveries.html">
IRAS discoveries </a> included
a disk of dust grains around the star Vega, six new comets, 
and very strong
infrared emission from interacting galaxies as well as wisps of warm dust
called infrared cirrus which could be found in almost every direction of
space.  IRAS also revealed for the first time the core of our galaxy, the
Milky Way.  
<p>
Several successful infrared satellite missions were launched after IRAS.
During July and August of 1985, an infrared telescope was flown onboard
the Space Shuttle's Spacelab 2 to complement observations made by the IRAS
mission.  This mission produced a high quality map of about 60% of the 
plane of our galaxy.

In November 1989, NASA launched the <FONT size=+2 color=#ff0000>*</font>
<a href="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cobe_home.html">COBE</a>
satellite to study both infrared and microwave 
characteristics of the cosmic background radiation (the remains of the extreme
heat that was created by the Big Bang).             
Over a ten month period, COBE mapped the brightness of the
entire sky at several infrared wavelengths and discovered that the cosmic
background radiation is not entirely smooth, showing extremely small variations
in temperature.  These variations may have led to the formation of galaxies.

The Infrared Telescope in Space (IRTS)</a>, launched In March 1995, was Japan's
first infrared satellite mission.  During its 28 day mission, IRTS surveyed
about 7% of the sky with four instruments: A Near and Mid Infrared Spectrometer
which covered wavelengths of 1.4 to 4 microns and 4.5 to 11
microns respectively, a Far Infrared Line Mapper which studied Oxygen and 
Carbon spectral lines at 63 and 158 microns, and a Far infrared Photometer
which studied the sky at four bands centered at 150, 250, 400, and 700 microns.
This data should add to our knowledge of cosmology, interstellar matter, 
late type stars and interplanetary dust.
<p>
The European Space Agency launched the
<FONT size+2 color=#ff0000>*</font>
<a href="http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/">Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)</a>
in November 1995.   ISO, which observed at wavelengths between 2.5 and 240
microns, not only covered a much wider wavelength range than IRAS but was also
thousands of times more sensitive than IRAS and viewed infrared sources
with much better resolution.  ISO took data for about 2.5 years (3 times      
times longer than IRAS).  It ceased operations in April 1998 when its supply
liquid helium ran out.                   
ISO contained instruments which measured details of both the shorter and
longer wavelength regions of the infrared spectrum, an infrared camera which
had two infrared arrays, and a photometer.  

Unlike IRAS, which was an infrared survey mission, ISO is operated like a
ground based observatory, having astronomers submit observing proposals to
study specific astronomical objects in detail.  
As hundreds of astronomers from
several countries study the data from ISO, important
<FONT size=+2 color=#ff0000>*</font>
<a href="http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/outreach/esa_pr/pressrel.htm">new discoveries</a>
about our universe are expected to emerge. 
ISO has already detected dry ice in interstellar dust and hydrocarbons in
some nebulae.

<a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/ipac/msx/msx.html">The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX)</a> was launched in April 1996 and lasted until end
of helium in Feb 1997.  During its 10 months of operation, MSX gathered a vast
amount of data at 4.2 - 26 microns.  MSX studied the infrared emission from the
gas and dust which permeates the universe.
MSX had 30 times the spatial resolution as IRAS and surveyed
areas of the sky which were missed by IRAS.
