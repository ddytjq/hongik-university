     Jeff Jones, of Dorrance, Pennsylvania, has been driving
     NASCAR Asphalt Modified race cars since he was 22 years old. 
     He has participated in NASCAR races all over the east coast,
     and has raced at many tracks including Flemington Speedway,
     New Jersey; Shangri-La Speedway, New York (now called Tioga
     Speedway); New Smyrna Speedway, in Daytona, Florida;
     Evergreen Raceway, Wall Stadium, and Mahoning Valley
     Speedway, in Pennsylvania.

<br><br>

     Jeff is an extremely competitive driver.  He is respected
     among his peers and has proven himself to be a top-notch
     driver on both short tracks and super-speedways.  Jeff takes
     good physical care of himself and works out regularly; an
     important asset as a driver.  Jeff pays special attention to
     the fans, and is an excellent representative for any type of
     sponsor.

<br><br>

     A business owner himself, Jeff recognizes the importance of
     promoting his sponsor.  Because he owns his own business,
     Jeff is able to take time out for personal appearances and
     other sponsor-related events.
