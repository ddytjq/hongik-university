Lowell maintains a modest visiting-observer program, through whose good graces 
I've gotten a large collection of galaxy images (especially of interacting 
systems) through the 1.1-meter Hall telescope. This instrument is at
the observatory's Anderson Mesa dark-sky site south of Flagstaff, also
home of the 1.8m Perkins telescope, the National Undergraduate Research 
Observatory, and the Naval Observatory's Prototype Optical Interferometer.
Many of these images were used in 
conjunction with Kitt Peak long-slit spectra to connect the morphological 
distortions to kinematic and star-forming features produced during interactions. 
Here are some sample galaxy pairs from the 42-inch (which has also been a
major contributor to my <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/choosepic.html">
Messier gallery</a>). Further samples of Seyfert galaxy images from the
1.1m may be seen <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/agn/seyferts.html"> here</a>.</p>

<p>
Lowell Observatory has strong historical associations. You can visit
Percival Lowell's 24-inch refractor in its wedding-cake dome,
once floated on salt water and turned by pulling on ropes for
a distinctly nautical feel. Even his tomb evokes the sky and 
the observatory. Not only the telescope, but the photographic
plates, used to discover Pluto, are on display. 
And reaching
for more light, the Perkins Observatory 1.8-m reflector (shared currently with
Ohio Wesleyan University) has been relocated
from Ohio to Anderson Mesa, just south of Flagstaff.
Anderson Mesa also hosts the 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/npoi/">Naval Prototype Optical
Interferometer (NPOI)</a>  and the 
National Undergraduate Research Observatory 
(NURO). The Lowell headquarters in Flagstaff is well worth a visit, especially
with the new visitor center. The dome of the old library (sadly, I'm not sure
it's still open to visitors) is a work of art, with the large painting of
Lowell and the history of Mars exploration and a huge stained-glass Saturn
lamp overhead. One can see one of the original discovery plates of Pluto,
and on public nights look through the classic refractor (I couldn't find
any canals painted into the eyepiece). And if you've gotten this far,
you can't pass up visits to Meteor Crater, Sunset Crater, and the Wupatki
ruins.</p>

<p> <a href="lowtombx.jpg"><img src="lowtombxs.jpg" height=250 width=341
alt="Tomb of Percival Lowell" align=right></a> One 
of the more unusual sights on Mars Hill is Percival Lowell's
tomb, remniscent of both the dome of an observatory and the 
night sky, overlooking Flagstaff. It is inscribed with some of his quotations 
about the vicissitudes of an astronomer's life, such as the need to separate
oneself from the mass of humanity in mountaintop contemplation of
cosmic mysteries:</p>

<p><i>
Astronomy now demands bodily abstraction of its devotee... To see into
the beyond requires purity... and the securing it makes him
perforce a hermit from his kind... He must abandon cities and forego plains...
Only in places above and aloof from men can he profitably pursue his search.
He must learn to wait upon his opportunities and no less to wait for
mankind's acceptance of his results... for in common with most explorers 
he will encounter on his return that final penalty of penetration - the 
certainty at first of being disbelieved.
</i> (from <b> Mars and its Canals</b>).</p>

<p>Both Lowell sites may be seen in these USGS images from the Terraserver
site (go straight there for the
<a href="">
Flagstaff</a> or
<a href="">
Anderson Mesa</a> locations). The Anderson Mesa picture also shows the
NPOI interferometer arms.</p>
