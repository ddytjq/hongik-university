The disorder is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and physical features that may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, such abnormalities tend to involve the cheekbones, jaws, mouth, ears, eyes, and/or bones of the spinal column (vertebrae). Although, in most cases, such malformations affect one side of the body (unilateral), approximately 10 to 33 percent of affected individuals have such malformations on both sides of the body (bilateral), with one side typically more affected than the other (asymmetry). In the majority of such cases, the right side is more severely affected than the left.<p>Click <A HREF="http://www.stepstn.com/cgi-win/nord.exe?proc=GetDocument&rectype=0&recnum=346">NORD for more data.</A></blockquote>Additional information can be obtained through the following support organization:<BR><A HREF="http://www.ccakids.com/">Children's Craniofacial Association</A><BR> P.O.

In the vast majority of cases it is an isolated developmentaldefect not associated with other abnormalities. However, the remote possibilityexists that it could be associated with other abnormalities of the first andsecond branchial arch. Accessory tragus is a consistent feature of theoculoauriculovertebral syndrome (Goldenhar syndrome). When correctlyidentified, surgical excision of accessory tragus is quite simple and rarelyresults in any complications.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Abnormalities-diagnosis;*Ear,-External-abnormalities; *Skin-Neoplasms-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Abnormalities-pathology; Child,-Preschool;Diagnosis,-Differential; Ear-Cartilages-abnormalities; Infant-;Skin-Diseases-diagnosis; Skin-Neoplasms-pathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review-of-Reported-Cases<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; pathology; abnormalities<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20010215<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20536120<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 2 of 99 in MEDLINE (R) 2001/01-2001/02<p>TITLE:  [Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum]<p>AUTHOR:  Izumikawa,-Y<p>SOURCE:  Ryoikibetsu-Shokogun-Shirizu. 2000; (30 Pt 5): 220-1<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  Japanese; Non-English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  JAPAN<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome-etiology;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-physiopathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Chromosome-Abnormalities; Diagnosis,-Differential;Prognosis-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  etiology; physiopathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20010125<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20510968<p>Record 3 of 99 in MEDLINE (R) 2001/01-2001/02<p>TITLE:  Unilateral semicircular canal aplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome.<p>AUTHOR:  Lemmerling,-M-M; Vanzieleghem,-B-D; Mortier,-G-R; Dhooge,-I-J;Kunnen,-M-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Radiology, University Hospital Gent,Belgium.<p>SOURCE:  AJNR-Am-J-Neuroradiol. 2000 Aug; 21(7): 1334-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0195-6108<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  A patient with Goldenhar's syndrome (oculoauriculovertebraldysplasia) and unilateral aplasia of all semicircular canals is presented.

METHODS: We measured fetal nuchal translucency (NT) in 6,338 womenpregnant from 10+3 to 13+6 weeks by ultrasound and evaluated the prevalence ofNT=95th centile in 115 multiple pregnancies, including 100 pairs of twins (70dichorionic and 30 monochorionic placentas), 9 triplets, 5 quadruplets, and onequintuplet. Chorionicity, fetal karyotype, and pregnancy outcome were alsoevaluated in 400 singleton pregnancies. RESULTS: NT=95th centile in a singlefetus was found in 10/70 cases of dichorionic twin pregnancies (14%), in twoquadruplets, in 7/30 monochorionic twin pregnancies (23.3%), and in bothfetuses in one dichorionic twin pregnancy. In the control group, NT=95thcentile was found in 17/400 (4.2%) cases. In multiple pregnancies, two cases oftrisomy 21 and one of 47, XXY were found. NT=95th centile was found in 2/2fetuses with trisomy 21 (one dichorionic twin pregnancy and one tetrachorionicpregnancy), but not in the 47, XXY trisomy (trichorionic triplet pregnancy). Askeletal dysplasia and a Goldenhar syndrome were found among the 10 dichorionicpregnancies with increased NT. Three intrauterine deaths of both fetuses, onecongenital heart disease, and a case of twin-to-twin transfusion occurred in 7monochorionic pregnancies with increased NT. CONCLUSION: Increased NT inmultiple pregnancies indicates fetuses at risk of chromosomal abnormalities andfetal malformation, and monochorionic twin pregnancies at higher risk ofadverse outcome.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Abnormalities-ultrasonography; *Neck-ultrasonography;*Pregnancy,-Multiple; *Ultrasonography,-Prenatal<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Chromosome-Abnormalities-ultrasonography;Pregnancy-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Comparative-Study; Female; Human; Pregnancy;Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  ultrasonography<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001214<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20420554<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 5 of 99 in MEDLINE (R) 2001/01-2001/02<p>TITLE:  Branchial cleft anomaly, congenital heart disease, and biliary atresia:Goldenhar complex or Lambert syndrome?<p>AUTHOR:  Cohen,-J; Schanen,-N-C<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatrics, University of California, LosAngeles 90095-7088, USA.<p>SOURCE:  Genet-Couns. 2000; 11(2): 153-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1015-8146<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  SWITZERLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  The features of Goldenhar complex have been well-described andclassically include branchial arch abnormalities, epibulbar dermoid andvertebral abnormalities. We have identified an infant with these features inassociation with complex congenital heart disease and intrahepatic biliaryatresia. Although Lambert described an autosomal recessive disorder with anassociation of biliary atresia and branchial arch abnormalities, none of thosecases had epibulbar dermoid. Diagnostic considerations in this case includeinclusion of biliary atresia as a new feature in the expanding spectrum of theGoldenhar complex, versus Lambert syndrome with epibulbar dermoid.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-genetics;*Biliary-Atresia-genetics; *Branchioma-genetics; *Goldenhar-Syndrome-genetics;*Head-and-Neck-Neoplasms-genetics; *Heart-Defects,-Congenital-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Abnormalities,-Multiple-diagnosis;Biliary-Atresia-diagnosis; Branchioma-diagnosis; Diagnosis,-Differential;Genetic-Counseling; Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis;Head-and-Neck-Neoplasms-diagnosis; Heart-Defects,-Congenital-diagnosis;Infant-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; genetics<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001121<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20352131<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 6 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 2000/11-2000/12<p>TITLE:  Hemifacial spasm or subcortical epilepsy?<p>AUTHOR(S):  Arzimanoglou-AA; Salefranque-F; Goutieres-F; Aicardi-J<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Child Neurology and Metabolic Diseases Dpt., HopitalRobert-Debre, Paris, France. alexis.arzimanoglou@rdb.ap-hop-paris.fr<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Epileptic-Disord. 1999 Jun; 1(2): 121-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1294-9361<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  FRANCE<p>ABSTRACT:  A child with Goldenhar's syndrome presented at about one week of agewith stereotyped, repetitive paroxysmal episodes of hemifacial contraction,suggestive of partial seizures or hemifacial spasm. Later in life he alsodeveloped independent, permanent abnormal eye and chin movements identical inrhythm to those seen in myorhythmias, suggesting involvement of thedentato-olivary pathway. MRI demonstrated a hamartomatous lesion at the levelof the pontomedullary junction. We speculate that the nature of the lesioncould be responsible for the partial seizures mimicking hemifacial spasm andthat because of its location, this same lesion could also be implicated in thegenesis of myorhythmias. The presence of a hamartomatous lesion in a regionaffected by the abnormal development of the first and second branchial archesis not fortuitous.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Cerebellar-Diseases-diagnosis;Cerebellar-Diseases-physiopathology; Cerebellum-physiopathology; Child-;Child,-Preschool; Epilepsies,-Partial-physiopathology; Follow-Up-Studies;Goldenhar-Syndrome-physiopathology; Hamartoma-diagnosis;Hamartoma-physiopathology; Hemifacial-Spasm-physiopathology; Infant-;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Medulla-Oblongata-abnormalities;Medulla-Oblongata-physiopathology; Pons-abnormalities; Pons-physiopathology<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Epilepsies,-Partial-diagnosis;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis; *Hemifacial-Spasm-diagnosis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  20392833<p>UPDATE CODE:  200011<p>Record 7 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 2000/01-2000/10<p>TITLE:  Pulsatile expansion therapy for orbital enlargement.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Wagner-A; Schneider-C; Lagogiannis-G; Hollman-K<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Clinic of Maxillofacial Surgery, Vienna Medical School,University of Vienna, Austria. arnewagner@univie.ac.at<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Int-J-Oral-Maxillofac-Surg. 2000 Apr; 29(2):91-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0901-5027<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  DENMARK<p>ABSTRACT:  Experimental and clinical investigations have documented themodulatory role of the globe in the development of the orbit.

We report the case of a 9-month-old girl who presentedbilateral congenital corneal anesthesia. The child had a corneal ulcer whichhad been unresponsive to adapted local treatment. Self-inflicted cornealinjuries were present. Local treatment and arm splints led to quick healing.CCA occurs either alone or in association with neurological diseases (familialdysautonomia) or systemic congenital abnormalities (Goldenhar Gorlin syndrome).It is important to search for corneal anesthesia in children with chroniculcerations of the cornea and self-inflicted injuries. Early diagnosis isimportant due to the risk for the visual prognosis. Short and longtermprevention of self-inflicted corneal injuries should be associated with a localtreatment to assure rapid healing and a relapse free outcome.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Corneal-Ulcer-diagnosis; Diagnosis,-Differential;English-Abstract; Face-abnormalities; Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis; Infant-;Prognosis-; Self-Mutilation-diagnosis; Self-Mutilation-prevention-and-control<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Cornea-injuries; *Corneal-Diseases-diagnosis;*Pain-Insensitivity,-Congenital-diagnosis; *Self-Mutilation<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; English-Abstract; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  20206802<p>UPDATE CODE:  200008<p>Record 12 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 2000/01-2000/10<p>TITLE:  Congenital anomalies in patients with Duane retraction syndrome andtheir relatives.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Marshman-WE; Schalit-G; Jones-RB; Lee-JP; Matthews-TD; McCabe-S<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Strabismus and Paediatric Service and the Department ofOrthoptics, Moorfields Eye Hospital, City Road, London, England.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-AAPOS. 2000 Apr; 4(2): 106-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1091-8531<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: Although the high incidence of skeletal, neural, and otherocular problems has been identified in previous reports of large cohorts ofpatients with Duane syndrome, there has not been any documentation of anomaliesin close relatives. Patients with Duane syndrome have a greater than 50%incidence of associated abnormalities that include deafness, other ocularanomalies, cranial nerve palsies, and skeletal abnormalities. This study wasundertaken to review the experience of our strabismus service with patients whohave Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) and to delineate the associated anomaliesin them and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: A prospective study of allpatients with Duane syndrome who were seen at the strabismus service atMoorfields Eye Hospital has been ongoing for the last 4 years. All patientswere assessed for the presence of ophthalmologic features of DRS and thenreferred to the pediatric service for a physical and neurologic examination.First-degree relatives were also examined, and a family pedigree was generated.RESULTS: We have evaluated 68 patients with DRS, of which 60.2% were femalepatients. The left eye was involved at a ratio of 4:1 in unilateral cases. Thenumber of bilateral cases was 57.3%. Among the patients with DRS, 46% hadfirst-degree relatives with associated abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The highincidence of associated anomalies in patients and first-degree relatives maysuggest that a common genetic defect is responsible. This has to be confirmedwith molecular genetic studies, which were not performed on these familiesbecause of a lack of available resources. However, our findings may indicatethat the inheritance of Duane syndrome is much higher than the 10% previouslyreported, if any congenital abnormality is accepted as DRS associated. Childrenwith Duane syndrome may benefit from a full medical assessment, in view of thefrequency of other abnormalities, and so may their siblings.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child-; Duane-Retraction-Syndrome-complications;Goldenhar-Syndrome-genetics; Pedigree-; Prospective-Studies<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-genetics;*Bone-and-Bones-abnormalities; *Duane-Retraction-Syndrome-genetics;*Ear-abnormalities; *Eye-Abnormalities-genetics;*Nervous-System-Malformations-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Comparative-Study; Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  20238154<p>UPDATE CODE:  200008<p>Record 13 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 2000/01-2000/10<p>TITLE:  A modified nasopharyngeal tube to relieve high upper airwayobstruction.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Chang-AB; Masters-IB; Williams-GR; Harris-M; O'Neil-MC<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mater MisericordiaeChildren's Hospital, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Pediatr-Pulmonol. 2000 Apr; 29(4): 299-306<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  8755-6863<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Infants with high upper airway obstruction (UAO) are managed with avariety of techniques to relieve their UAO. Among these techniques, the leastinvasive and safest is the nasopharyngeal tube (NPT). However, the traditionalNPT is not always satisfactory, and tracheostomies need to be done. We recentlydescribed a modified NPT technique that, in contrast to the traditional tube,does not add airway dead space and resistance, is easy to use, iswell-tolerated, has proven highly successful, and allows the simultaneous useof oxygen nasal prongs. This modified NPT has many advantages over thetraditional NPT as a temporary management of high UAO that resolves with growthof the infant. This report highlights the respiratory care of 10 infants withhigh UAO (Pierre Robin syndrome, Down syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, isolatedmicrongathia, and idiopathic hypotonia) who were managed with a modified NPT.The modified NPT described potentially reduces the need for surgicalintervention to relieve high UAO in infants.

Thesetechniques allow one to reproduce anatomical objects as 3D physical models,which give the surgeon a realistic impression of complex structures before asurgical intervention. The shift from the visual to the visual-tactilerepresentation of anatomical objects introduces a new kind of interactioncalled 'touch to comprehend'. As can be seen, from the presented case studiesof maxillo-cranio-facial surgery, the RP models are very well suited for use inthe diagnosis and the precise preoperative simulation of skeleton modifyinginterventions.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Acrocephalosyndactylia-surgery; Adult-; Child,-Preschool;Craniosynostoses-surgery; Diagnostic-Imaging; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery;Lasers-; Osteotomy,-Le-Fort-methods; Plastics-; Polyurethanes-;Resins,-Synthetic; Therapy,-Computer-Assisted<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Computer-Aided-Design; *Face-surgery; *Jaw-surgery;*Models,-Anatomic; *Patient-Care-Planning; *Skull-surgery<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Plastics; Polyurethanes; Resins,-Synthetic<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  20102196<p>UPDATE CODE:  200004<p>Record 16 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 2000/01-2000/10<p>TITLE:  Epidemiology of cleft lip and palate in Singapore--a 10-yearhospital-based study.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Yi-NN; Yeow-VK; Lee-ST<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Plastic Surgery, Singapore General Hospital,Singapore.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Ann-Acad-Med-Singapore. 1999 Sep; 28(5):655-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0304-4602<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  SINGAPORE<p>ABSTRACT:  During the study period from January 1985 to December 1994, therewere 1105 new cleft cases seen in the Department of Plastic Surgery, SingaporeGeneral Hospital.

Out of the 1105 new cleft cases seen, 984 wereSingaporeans. The incidence of this hospital-based study of cleft population inSingapore was 2.07 per 1000 livebirths. Chinese had the highest incidence of1.64 per 1000 as compared to Malay, Indian and other races. The most commontype of cleft deformity was complete cleft lip and palate. The left side wasfound to be more affected than the right side in all types of cleft deformity.There was no significant difference in sex distribution; the male to femaleratio was 1.1:1. However, females had a higher incidence of cleft palate thanmales.

While the formerare easily recognized, especially when part of a syndrome, the latter are oftenoccult, thereby delaying their diagnosis. The presence of vertebral anomaliesmust be considered in pediatric patients with head and neck abnormalities toexpedite management of select cases and to prevent neurologic injury. Wepresent our experience with 5 pediatric patients who were referred to theDepartment of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Iowawith a variety of syndromic anomalies of the head and neck. Each patient wassubsequently also found to have a vertebral anomaly. The relevant embryogenesisof the anomalous structures is discussed, with highlighting of potential causessuch as teratogenic agents and events and germ-line mutations. A review ofsyndromes having both head and neck and vertebral anomalies is presented toheighten awareness of otolaryngologists evaluating children with syndromicdisorders. Finally, the findings on radiographic imaging studies, particularlycomputed tomography, are discussed to facilitate the prompt diagnosis ofvertebral anomalies.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Abnormalities,-Multiple; Adolescence-;Cervical-Vertebrae-radiography; Child-; Down-Syndrome-diagnosis;Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis; Head-radiography; Infant-;Klippel-Feil-Syndrome-diagnosis; Neck-radiography; Tomography,-X-Ray-Computed<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Cervical-Vertebrae-abnormalities; *Head-abnormalities;*Neck-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99453970<p>UPDATE CODE:  200001<p>SUBSET:  AIM<p>Record 18 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Auditory and facial nerve dysfunction in patients with hemifacialmicrosomia.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Carvalho-GJ; Song-CS; Vargervik-K; Lalwani-AK<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,University of California, San Francisco, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Arch-Otolaryngol-Head-Neck-Surg. 1999 Feb;125(2): 209-12<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0886-4470<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a common craniofacialdisorder characterized by a wide spectrum of anomalies, including conductivehearing loss due to external and middle ear deformities. However, theprevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as well as facial nervedysfunction is underappreciated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency ofauditory and facial nerve dysfunction and its relationship to more severe formsof bilateral HFM. DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review to characterizethe clinical severity of HFM and the prevalence and nature of the associatedauditory and facial nerve dysfunction. SETTING: Center for CraniofacialAnomalies at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center.PATIENTS: Ninety-nine pediatric patients with HFM evaluated at the Universityof California, San Francisco, Medical Center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Theprevalence of SNHL and facial nerve dysfunction in this patient population andany associations between these 2 characteristics. RESULTS: Hearing loss waspresent in 74 (75%) of 99 patients, with a conductive component in 73 patients.Sensorineural hearing loss was present in 11 patients ( 11%), with mixedhearing loss in most patients. Fourteen patients required rehabilitation withauditory amplification. Nearly a quarter of the patients (22 [22%] of 99) hadfacial nerve dysfunction, but only 1 patient had facial palsy on the same sideas the SNHL. There was a statistically significant association between havingauricular abnormalities and conductive hearing loss or SNHL (P = .30 and .80,respectively). However, there was no statistically significant associationbetween bilateral HFM and the occurrence of either SNHL or facial paralysis,nor was there an association between auditory and facial nerve dysfunction.CONCLUSIONS: Sensorineural hearing loss and facial nerve dysfunction are commonin HFM. These findings have important implications in the treatment of patientswith HFM.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Facial-Asymmetry-diagnosis; Facial-Asymmetry-physiopathology;Facial-Paralysis-congenital; Facial-Paralysis-diagnosis;Facial-Paralysis-physiopathology; Goldenhar-Syndrome-physiopathology;Hearing-Loss,-Conductive-congenital; Hearing-Loss,-Conductive-diagnosis;Hearing-Loss,-Conductive-physiopathology;Hearing-Loss,-Sensorineural-congenital; Hearing-Loss,-Sensorineural-diagnosis;Hearing-Loss,-Sensorineural-physiopathology; Infant-; Retrospective-Studies;San-Francisco<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Facial-Asymmetry-congenital;*Facial-Nerve-physiopathology; *Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis;*Vestibulocochlear-Nerve-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99154892<p>UPDATE CODE:  199905<p>SUBSET:  AIM<p>Record 19 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma associated with Goldenhar's syndrome.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Ostlere-SJ; McDonald-B; Athanasou-NA<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pathology and Radiology, Nuffield OrthopaedicCentre, Oxford OX3 7LD, UK.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Arch-Orthop-Trauma-Surg. 1999; 119(5-6):347-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0936-8051<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  Goldenhar's syndrome is characterised by bony abnormalities of theface, jaw and vertebral column.

It is generally seen as an isolated malformation.However, some authors consider it to be a minimal manifestation of theoculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS), where, in addition, there are facial,vertebral, and renal abnormalities, among others. METHODS: A total of 145pediatric patients with unilateral or bilateral microtia not considered as partof a syndrome were studied. All patients were subjected to an intentionalclinical examination, a familial history, and radiographic imaging studies forruling out associated malformations. Patients were classified into two groups:group 1 (60%), with isolated microtia; and group 2 (40%), considered as OAVS,with microtia associated with hemifacial skeletal microsomia, vertebral and/orrenal malformations. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between thegroups when the following variables were compared: gender; presence ofunilateral or bilateral microtia; atretic external auditory canal; presence ofpreauricular tags; hearing loss of any type, and affection of the seventhcranial nerve, as well as associated malformations of other organs or systems.There were significant differences in relation to the presence of soft-tissuehemifacial microsomia, more frequently seen in patients with OAVS, because themajority of these patients had bone microsomia. Over 66% of the cases weresporadic and the rest were familiar. In 28.3% of the cases, the historysuggested an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, and in 5.5%, anautosomal-recessive inheritance pattern, although in some familial cases,multifactorial inheritance could not be ignored. Some members in severalfamilies had isolated microtia, and others had mild characteristicmanifestations of OAVS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis thatisolated microtia is a minimal expression of OAVS. Therefore, it is recommendedthat patients with microtia be subjected to intentional studies that search formalformations and physical examinations of first-degree relatives for adequategenetic counseling and management.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Abnormalities-epidemiology; Adolescence-; Child-;Child,-Preschool; Goldenhar-Syndrome-epidemiology; Goldenhar-Syndrome-genetics;Goldenhar-Syndrome-pathology; Government-Agencies; Infant-;Mexico-epidemiology; Pediatrics-; Pedigree-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Ear-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99301033<p>UPDATE CODE:  199909<p>Record 21 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Goldenhar anomaly in one of triplets derived from in vitrofertilization [letter]<p>AUTHOR(S):  Ferraris-S; Silengo-M; Ponzone-A; Perugini-L<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Am-J-Med-Genet. 1999 May 21; 84(2): 167-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0148-7299<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Diagnosis,-Differential; Infant,-Newborn<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Fertilization-in-Vitro; *Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis;*Triplets-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  LETTER<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99255343<p>UPDATE CODE:  199909<p>Record 22 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Treatment of epibulbar limbal dermoids.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Kaufman-A; Medow-N; Phillips-R; Zaidman-G<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Corneal and Refractive Surgery Service, University ofCincinnati, Ohio, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-Pediatr-Ophthalmol-Strabismus. 1999May-Jun; 36(3): 136-40<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0191-3913<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Astigmatism-etiology; Child,-Preschool;Corneal-Diseases-complications; Corneal-Diseases-pathology;Dermoid-Cyst-complications; Dermoid-Cyst-pathology;Eye-Neoplasms-complications; Eye-Neoplasms-pathology;Goldenhar-Syndrome-complications; Orbit-; Visual-Acuity<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Corneal-Diseases-surgery; *Dermoid-Cyst-surgery;*Eye-Neoplasms-surgery; *Limbus-Corneae-pathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99286869<p>UPDATE CODE:  199909<p>Record 23 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Management of difficult airways with a laryngeal mask airway underpropofol anaesthesia.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Bahk-JH; Han-SM; Kim-SD<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Anaesthesiology, Seoul National UniversityHospital, Korea.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Paediatr-Anaesth. 1999; 9(2): 163-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1155-5645<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  FRANCE<p>ABSTRACT:  We report four cases of difficult airway managed with a laryngealmask airway (LMA) under propofol anaesthesia; this method was chosen tominimize psychological and physical trauma.

To determine the spectrum of SALL1 mutations andto investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations in TBS, we examined 23additional families with TBS or similar phenotypes for SALL1 mutations. In 9 ofthese families mutations were identified. None of the mutations has previouslybeen described. Two of these mutations are nonsense mutations, one of whichoccurred in three unrelated families. Five of the mutations are shortdeletions. All of the mutations are located 5' of the first double zinc finger(DZF) encoding region and are therefore predicted to result in putativeprematurely terminated proteins lacking all DZF domains. This suggests thatonly SALL1 mutations that remove the DZF domains result in TBS. We also presentevidence that in rare cases SALL1 mutations can lead to phenotypes similar toGoldenhar syndrome. However, phenotypic differences in TBS do not seem todepend on the site of mutation.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Anus,-Imperforate-genetics; Base-Sequence;Cloning,-Molecular; Exons-; Frameshift-Mutation;Hearing-Loss,-Sensorineural-genetics; Molecular-Sequence-Data; Pedigree-;Polymorphism-Genetics; Syndrome-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-genetics; *Mutation-;*Transcription-Factors-genetics; *Zinc-Fingers-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Hsal1-protein; Transcription-Factors<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99138656<p>UPDATE CODE:  199906<p>SECONDARY SOURCE IDENTIFIER:  GENBANK/Y18264; GENBANK/Y18265; GENBANK/X98833<p>Record 25 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  [Anomalies of the efferent lacrimal ducts in Goldenhar syndrome(news)]<p>ORIGINAL TITLE:  Anomalien der ableitenden Tranenwege bei Goldenhar-Syndrom.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Luchtenberg-M; Blotiu-A; Lindemann-G; Emmerich-KH<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Augenklinik Klinikum Darmstadt.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Klin-Monatsbl-Augenheilkd. 1998 Dec; 213(6):aA8-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0023-2165<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  GERMAN; NON-ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Dacryocystitis-therapy; Goldenhar-Syndrome-therapy;Infant-; Lacrimal-Duct-Obstruction-therapy<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Dacryocystitis-diagnosis; *Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis;*Lacrimal-Apparatus-abnormalities; *Lacrimal-Duct-Obstruction-diagnosis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  NEWS<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99157534<p>UPDATE CODE:  199906<p>Record 26 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Transarterial approach of the pulmonary artery in anatomicallycorrected malposition of the great arteries by manipulating a catheter invertedwith balloon floating maneuver.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Lee-ML; Chiu-IS; Wu-MH; Wang-JK; Lue-HC; Chaou-WT; Tsao-LY<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatrics, Changhua Christian Hospital,Taiwan.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Int-J-Cardiol. 1998 Nov 30; 67(1): 1-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0167-5273<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  IRELAND<p>ABSTRACT:  We describe two neonates with anatomically corrected malposition ofthe great arteries (ACM). A 1-day-old female newborn, who had the salientclinical findings of Goldenhar syndrome, behaved like a patient with thetetralogy of Fallot. The cardiac malformations included ACM, perimembranousinlet and outlet ventricular septal defect with tricuspid valve straddling,conoventricular septal malaligement, bilateral cori without aortic-mitralcontinuity, pulmonary stenosis at subvalvular, valvular, and supravalvularlevels, and bicuspid semilunar valves. After the procedure of leftBlalock-Taussig shunt at 3 months of age, cyanosis was alleviated. The other1-month-old male newborn, who presented with prolonged feeding, tachypnea andtachycardia, likened to a patient with the hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Hehad a combination of ACM, mitral stenosis, hypoplastic left atrium and leftventricle, a restrictive patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect,subaortic conus without aortic-mitral continuity, subaortic stenosis, and anarrow ascending aortic root. Rashkind balloon atrioseptostomy was done withlimited success. He survived a Norwood procedure.

Five patients, one with mandibulardysostosis, one with otomandibular dysostosis, two with Goldenhar syndrome, andone with a surgically revised fibroma of the right mandible that wasreconstructed by a costochondral graft, were treated by means of an activatorfunctional appliance. During functional appliance treatment, all patientsshowed improvement of function and occlusion, and facial asymmetry was reduced.Spiral computed tomographic examination before and during treatment provideddata on the bony and muscular deficiencies. The volume and density of thelateral pterygoid muscle was measured with the standard computed tomographysoftware. Evaluation of soft and hard tissue conditions before treatment hasshown that the most important factor "lack of soft tissues" can be compensatedby excellent cooperation during functional therapy. Pretreatment volume of theaffected lateral pterygoid muscle in all patients was significantly smallerthan on the unaffected side. In three patients, volume measurements between 4and 8 years demonstrated that the lateral pterygoid muscle on the affected sidehad a third, less than a third, and a fifth of the volume of the unaffectedside. Although increase, stability, and decrease of the ratio of left and rightcondylar dimension, muscular volume, and density were found, long-termprognosis cannot be given in the cases with extreme muscular deficiencies aftercessation of growth. Prepubertal orthopedic treatment success is a desirableand feasible presurgical or nonsurgical treatment goal for theinterdisciplinary team approach. From a study of the pathologic, we learn muchabout the normal.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child-; Child,-Preschool; Dysostoses-radiography;Dysostoses-therapy; Facial-Asymmetry-radiography;Goldenhar-Syndrome-radiography; Goldenhar-Syndrome-therapy;Mandibular-Diseases-radiography; Mandibular-Diseases-therapy;Pterygoid-Muscles-radiography; Temporomandibular-Joint-radiography;Time-Factors; Tomography,-X-Ray-Computed-methods; Treatment-Outcome<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Facial-Asymmetry-therapy; *Orthodontics,-Corrective<p>CHECKTAGS:  Comparative-Study; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99027628<p>UPDATE CODE:  199902<p>SUBSET:  DENTAL<p>Record 31 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Airway management in children with major craniofacial anomalies.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Sculerati-N; Gottlieb-MD; Zimbler-MS; Chibbaro-PD; McCarthy-JG<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Otolaryngology, New York University School ofMedicine, New York, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Laryngoscope. 1998 Dec; 108(12): 1806-12<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0023-852X<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVES: Delineation of clinical characteristics affecting theairway in a cohort of craniofacially deformed children. What factors differbetween patients requiring and those not requiring surgical airwayintervention? What factors predispose to the need for tracheotomy? When candecannulation be expected if tracheotomy is required? What interventions aiddecannulation? STUDY DESIGN: Five-year retrospective chart review at tertiarycenter. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-one patients met the following entrycriteria: enrollment in the New York University Institute of Reconstructive andPlastic Surgery's Craniofacial Clinic and admission to Tisch Hospital inManhattan for surgery from 1990 to 1994. Hospital, clinic, and departmentaloffice records were reviewed. All patients had major craniofacial bonyanomalies and underwent administration of general anesthesia at least once.RESULTS: Nearly 20% of all children required tracheotomy (47/251). Craniofacialsynostosis patients (Crouzon, Pfeiffer, or Apert syndrome) had the highest rateof tracheotomy (48% [28/59]). Mandibulofacial dysostoses patients (TreacherCollins or Nager syndrome) had the next highest rate (41% [28/59]). Patientswith oculo-auriculo-vertebral sequence were less likely to undergo tracheotomy(22% [9/41]). Children with craniosynostosis rarely required a surgical airway,unless there was marked associated facial dysmorphism (1% [1/72]). The durationof cannulation was related to the age at tracheotomy in a bimodal distribution.Generally, tracheotomies required before age 4 years remained for severalyears, whereas those placed after age 4 were removed after several weeks. Thepresence of a cleft palate correlated with reduced risk for tracheotomy, butthe presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt correlated with an increased riskfor tracheotomy. Procedures selectively used to improve the airway includedmidface advancement, mandibular expansion, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy,uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, anterior tongue reduction, and endoscopic trachealgranuloma excision. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood for surgical airway managementis related to specific craniofacial diagnosis. The length of trachealcannulation is greatest for infants and young children who manifest severeairway compromise, often because of nasal obstruction in combination with otheranatomic factors. Early tracheotomy is advocated for these patients to promoteoptimal growth and development. Choanal atresia is often misdiagnosed in theseinfants; nasal obstruction is actually secondary to midface retrusion. Stagedsurgical interventions can allow eventual successful decannulation in nearlyall cases of craniofacial syndromes.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Craniofacial-Dysostosis-complications; Craniofacial-Dysostosis-surgery;Goldenhar-Syndrome-complications; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery; Infant-;Infant,-Newborn; Mandibulofacial-Dysostosis-complications;Mandibulofacial-Dysostosis-surgery; Retrospective-Studies;Sleep-Apnea-Syndromes-complications<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Airway-Obstruction-etiology;*Airway-Obstruction-surgery; *Craniofacial-Abnormalities-complications;*Tracheotomy-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99066820<p>UPDATE CODE:  199902<p>Record 32 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Late gestational vascular disruptions inducing craniofacial anomalies:a fetal lamb model.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Escobar-LF; Liechty-EA<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University, School ofMedicine, Indianapolis, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-Craniofac-Genet-Dev-Biol. 1998 Jul-Sep;18(3): 159-63<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0270-4145<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  DENMARK<p>ABSTRACT:  We report our preliminary observations in six fetal lambs that weresurgically manipulated in utero to impede the blood flow of the carotidarteries and their branches, including the laryngeal artery, the anastomoticbranch between the vertebral artery and the occipital artery, the auricularisand the transverse facial arteries. Between 115 and 117 days of gestation (termpregnancy 147 days), all ewes were placed under general anesthesia andmechanical ventilation. Their fetuses were exteriorized and catheters wereplaced in their femoral artery for blood gas sampling. A balloon occluder and ablood flow probe were placed on one internal carotid while the contralateralside was completely ligated. On the third day post surgery, the balloonoccluder was inflated three times for 30 minutes each time at 30 minuteintervals in the experimental fetuses. PO2, PCO2, pH, lactate and glucose weremonitored during the study. At 7 days post occlusion, all animals weresacrificed and tissues were collected. Craniofacial anomalies were obvious inthree animals similar to those seen in hemifacial microsomia, Goldenharsyndrome and Pierre-Robin sequence. All three control animals had normalcraniofacial structures. This preliminary data suggests that late gestationvascular disruptions may lead to significant craniofacial anomalies, as seen inour animal model.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Carotid-Arteries-embryology; Carotid-Arteries-surgery;Fetal-Diseases; Ischemia-; Ligation-; Pregnancy-; Sheep-embryology<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Craniofacial-Abnormalities-etiology;*Facial-Bones-blood-supply; *Facial-Bones-embryology; *Gestational-Age;*Skull-blood-supply; *Skull-embryology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Animal; Female<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  99001399<p>UPDATE CODE:  199902<p>Record 33 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  A family with dominant oculoauriculovertebral spectrum.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Stoll-C; Viville-B; Treisser-A; Gasser-B<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Service de Genetique Medicale, CentreHospitalo-Universitaire, Strasbourg, France.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Am-J-Med-Genet. 1998 Jul 24; 78(4): 345-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0148-7299<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  In 1990, Gorlin et al. [Syndromes of the Head and Neck, New York:Oxford University Press, pp 641-649, 707-708] proposed to lump severalsyndromes together, including facioauriculovertebral syndrome, hemifacialmicrosomia, otomandibular dysostosis, Goldenhar syndrome, the first branchialarch anomalies and the first and second branchial arches anomalies. Theyproposed to use the term oculoauriculovertebral "spectrum." Because there is noagreement on minimal diagnostic criteria the phenotype overlaps many geneticand teratologic syndromes. Most cases are sporadic, but familial instances havealso been observed in first-degree relatives. We report on a mother and two ofher children who have the oculoauriculovertebral "spectrum." The mother hadonly auricular anomalies for which she had plastic and reconstructive surgery.Her first child, a girl, had a bilateral cleft lip and palate, a coloboma ofupper eyelid, facial asymmetry, and posteriorly angulated ears. This child alsohad bilateral vesicoureteral reflux. During the second pregnancy fetalultrasonographic examination performed at 18th week of gestation showed a cleftlip and palate. At the thirty-first week of gestation, club feet, hypoplasia ofthe left ear, hypoplasia of the left maxillary and mandibular arches, and leftmicrophthalmia were evident. Examination of this fetus confirmedultrasonographic findings and demonstrated vertebral anomalies. This familialobservation confirmed variable expressivity of the oculoauriculovertebralanomaly with isolated microtia (the mother), major malformations (the fetus),and less serious anomalies (the first child) and showed that this condition maybe inherited as an autosomal or X-linked dominant condition.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Abnormalities,-Multiple-diagnosis;Abnormalities,-Multiple-embryology; Cleft-Lip-embryology; Cleft-Lip-genetics;Cleft-Palate-embryology; Cleft-Palate-genetics;Diabetes,-Gestational-diet-therapy; Gestational-Age;Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis; Infant,-Newborn; Nuclear-Family; Pedigree-;Pregnancy-; Spine-abnormalities; Spine-embryology; Syndrome-;X-Chromosome-genetics<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-genetics; *Genes,-Dominant;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  98378239<p>UPDATE CODE:  199812<p>Record 34 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Electrocardiographic artefact with SSEP monitoring unit duringscoliosis surgery.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Choudhry-DK; Stayer-SA; Rehman-MA; Schwartz-RE<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Department ofAnesthesia and Critical Care, Philadelphia, PA 19134-1095, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Paediatr-Anaesth. 1998; 8(4): 341-3<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1155-5645<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  FRANCE<p>ABSTRACT:  A case of somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) inducedelectrocardiographic artefact simulating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) isdescribed in a three year old girl with Goldenhar syndrome, during anteriorthoracoscopic discectomy with posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study usingchart review, physical examination, and endoscopic evaluation of the pharynxand larynx, and perceptual and aerodynamic evaluation of speech for assessmentof vocal tract function. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center. PATIENTS:Chart review of 41 patients with a diagnosis of OAVS and clinical evaluation of23 of the patients identified in the initial chart review, ranging in age from9 months to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data from chart review pertainingto airway and speech symptoms. Physical examination and endoscopic studies ofpharyngeal and laryngeal structure and function and perceptual and aerodynamicevaluation of speech, resonance, and voice. RESULTS: Chart review showed a highoccurrence of indicators of pharyngeal and laryngeal abnormalities such asvelopharyngeal inadequacy and airway obstruction. Clinical evaluationsdocumented a variety of abnormalities in pharyngeal and laryngeal structure andfunction as well as impairment in speech articulation, resonance, and voice.Presence and severity of pharyngeal and laryngeal abnormalities were notcorrelated with the severity of expression of the spectrum based on mandibularmorphology. CONCLUSIONS: Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum appears to beassociated with a high occurrence of structural and functional abnormalities ofthe pharynx and larynx that may contribute to increased risk of airwayobstruction, communication impairment, and morbidity.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Airway-Obstruction-etiology; Child-;Child,-Preschool; Cross-Sectional-Studies; Endoscopy-; Evaluation-Studies;Infant-; Laryngoscopy-; Larynx-pathology; Larynx-physiopathology;Mandible-abnormalities; Mandible-pathology; Pharynx-pathology;Pharynx-physiopathology; Physical-Examination; Retrospective-Studies;Speech-physiology; Speech-Disorders-etiology;Velopharyngeal-Insufficiency-etiology; Vocal-Cords-physiopathology;Voice-physiology; Voice-Quality-physiology<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome-pathology; *Larynx-abnormalities;*Pharynx-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  98347914<p>UPDATE CODE:  199812<p>SUBSET:  DENTAL<p>Record 36 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Severe oculocerebrocutaneous (Delleman) syndrome: overlap withGoldenhar anomaly.<p>AUTHOR(S):  McCandless-SE; Robin-NH<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Center for Human Genetics, Department of Genetics, CaseWestern Reserve University School of Medicine, University Hospitals ofCleveland, Ohio, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Am-J-Med-Genet. 1998 Jul 7; 78(3): 282-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0148-7299<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome (OCCS), or Delleman syndrome, is amultiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by orbital cysts, cerebralmalformations, and focal dermal hypoplasia [Delleman and Oorthuys, 1981, ClinGenet 19:191-198; Delleman et al., 1984, Clin Genet 25:470-472]. Two previousreports presented children having what is suggested as the more severe form ofthe OCCS syndrome who also had anophthalmia, congenital hydrocephalus, andcleft lip and palate [Leichtman et al., 1994, Am J Med Genet 50:39-41; Angleand Hersh, 1997, Am J Med Genet 68:39-42]. We report on a third case of severeOCCS, an infant girl with a similar constellation of findings and additionalanomalies including lateral facial cleft, vertebral anomaly, and ventricularseptal defect. The additional findings in our patient highlight the phenotypicoverlap of OCCS and the Goldenhar anomaly, an overlap previously noted byDelleman and Oorthuys [1981], and others [Al-Gazali et al., 1988, J Med Genet25: 773-778].

Unfortunately, cardiorespiratory polygraphy isexpensive and time-consuming, and up until now today only a few pediatrichospitals have complete facilities for all-night cardiorespiratory polygraphy.Nevertheless, the prevalence of sleep related breathing disorders in childrenis higher than has previously been thought. To show the importance of properdiagnosis of sleep related breathing disorders, we report a case of a4-year-old girl with severe obstructive sleep apnea caused byGoldenhar-sequence (facio-auriculo-vertebral dysplasia). Despite some treatmentefforts to correct the aplastic right mandible, the symptoms of obstructivesleep apnea were not immediately recognized and remained untreated. Untreatedobstructive sleep apnea led to growth and mental retardation. After polygraphicconfirmation of obstructive sleep apnea and appropriate interdisciplinarytreatment, the 4-year-old girl made rapid advances in growth and mentaldevelopment.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child,-Preschool; Sleep-Apnea-Syndromes-diagnosis;Sleep-Apnea-Syndromes-therapy<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome-complications;*Sleep-Apnea-Syndromes-etiology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  98327083<p>UPDATE CODE:  199811<p>Record 39 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum disorder (Goldenhar "syndrome")coexisting with schizophreniform disorder [letter]<p>AUTHOR(S):  Brieger-P; Bartel-Friedrich-S; Haring-A; Marneros-A<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-Neurol-Neurosurg-Psychiatry. 1998 Jul;65(1): 135-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0022-3050<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adult-;Delirium,-Dementia,-Amnestic,-Cognitive-Disorders-diagnosis;Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis; Intelligence-; Neurologic-Examination;Neuropsychological-Tests; Psychotic-Disorders-diagnosis<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:*Delirium,-Dementia,-Amnestic,-Cognitive-Disorders-complications;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-complications; *Psychotic-Disorders-complications<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  LETTER<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  98330154<p>UPDATE CODE:  199809<p>Record 40 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Non-surgical treatment of upper airway obstruction inoculoauriculovertebral dysplasia: a case report.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Stellzig-A; Basdra-EK; Sontheimer-D; Komposch-G<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Orthodontics, Heidelberg University,Germany.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Eur-J-Orthod. 1998 Apr; 20(2): 111-4<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0141-5387<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  A non-surgical technique for the treatment of upper airwayobstruction in oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia using an intra-oral orthopaedicappliance is described, which resulted in respiratory and feeding problemsbeing solved without side-effects.

To investigate the characteristicphenotype of placode-derived neurons, immunohistochemical analysis ofintermediate filaments was conducted on formalin-fixed human embryonic tissues.Neurons arising from placodes including luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone(LHRH) neurons migrating from the olfactory placode to the brain hadimmunoreactivity to antibodies specific to cytokeratin, AE1 and CAM5.2 duringthe embryonic stage. However, this immunoreactivity disappeared during the lateembryonic to the post-embryonic stage and was not observed in the roots ofthese nerves in the post-natal stage. Immunoreactivity was detected in both thesomata and processes, and the distribution differed from that described inrodent brain neurons. With this exception, no other human peripheral neurons,including spinal dorsal root ganglia, had immunoreactivity withanti-cytokeratin antibodies throughout the entire developmental stage. Althoughthe cephalic neural crest also directly generates neurons to most of thecranial sensory ganglia, we could not find any evidence that it contributed tothe genesis of cytokeratin-positive embryonic neurons. We concluded thatcytokeratin is an intermediate filament common to human embryonic neurons ofcephalic placodal origin and that this immunohistochemical marker may be usefulin analyzing the developmental sequence of several congenital diseasesinvolving the cranial nerves, such as Moebius syndrome and Goldenharsyndrome.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adult-; Antibody-Specificity;Cell-Differentiation-physiology; Cranial-Nerves-chemistry;Cranial-Nerves-cytology; Cranial-Nerves-embryology; Facial-Nerve-chemistry;Facial-Nerve-cytology; Facial-Nerve-embryology; Immunohistochemistry-;Infant,-Newborn; Mesoderm-chemistry; Mesoderm-cytology; Neural-Crest-chemistry;Neural-Crest-embryology; Nodose-Ganglion-chemistry; Nodose-Ganglion-cytology;Nodose-Ganglion-embryology; Olfactory-Nerve-chemistry;Olfactory-Nerve-cytology; Olfactory-Nerve-embryology; Spinal-Cord-chemistry;Spinal-Cord-cytology; Spinal-Cord-embryology; Trigeminal-Nerve-chemistry;Trigeminal-Nerve-cytology; Trigeminal-Nerve-embryology;Vestibulocochlear-Nerve-chemistry; Vestibulocochlear-Nerve-cytology;Vestibulocochlear-Nerve-embryology<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Keratin-analysis; *Keratin-immunology;*Neural-Crest-cytology; *Neurons,-Afferent-chemistry<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  68238-35-7<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Keratin<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  97397449<p>UPDATE CODE:  199712<p>Record 44 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Goldenhar syndrome.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Lal-P; Agrawal-P; Krishna-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Surgery, University College of MedicalSciences, New Delhi.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Indian-Pediatr. 1997 Sep; 34(9): 837-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0019-6061<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  INDIA<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child,-Preschool; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery; India-;Infant,-Newborn<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  98153303<p>UPDATE CODE:  199805<p>Record 45 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Goldenhar syndrome among infants born in military hospitals to Gulf Warveterans.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Araneta-MR; Moore-CA; Olney-RS; Edmonds-LD; Karcher-JA;McDonough-C; Hiliopoulos-KM; Schlangen-KM; Gray-GC<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Naval Health Research Center, Division of ClinicalEpidemiology, San Diego, California 92186-5122, USA. araneta@nhrc.navy.mil<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Teratology. 1997 Oct; 56(4): 244-51<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0040-3709<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Reports in the popular press described the occurrence of Goldenharsyndrome among children of Persian Gulf War veterans (GWVs). The objective ofthis investigation was to compare the birth prevalence of Goldenhar syndromeamong infants born in military hospitals to GWVs and to military personnel whowere not deployed to the Gulf War (NDVs). Computerized hospital discharge datawere reviewed for infants conceived after the war and born prior to the 1st ofOctober, 1993, in medical treatment facilities (MTFs) operated by the U.S.Department of Defense. Medical records were evaluated for infants diagnosed atbirth with at least one abnormality that might be related to Goldenharsyndrome. Two pediatricians, blinded to the parental Gulf War status of eachinfant, reviewed records. An estimated 75,414 infants were conceived after theGulf War and born in MTFs during the study period (34,069 GWV infants and41,345 NDV infants). Seven infants fulfilled the case criteria (five GWVinfants and two NDV infants). All infants had fathers who served in themilitary at the time of their conception and birth. The birth prevalence was14.7 per 100,000 live births among GWV infants (95% confidence interval [CI]:5.4-36.4) and 4.8 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 0.8-19.5) among NDV infants(relative risk: 3.03; 95% CI: 0.63-20.57; P values: [2-tailed] = 0.26,[1-tailed] = 0.16). The few affected cases and the broad confidence intervalssurrounding the relative risk require that these results be interpreted withcaution and do not exclude chance as an explanation for these findings.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Environmental-Exposure;Goldenhar-Syndrome-etiology; Goldenhar-Syndrome-pathology; Infant,-Newborn;Middle-East; Pregnancy-; Prevalence-; United-States-epidemiology; Veterans-;War-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome-epidemiology; *Hospitals,-Military;*Military-Personnel<p>CHECKTAGS:  Comparative-Study; Female; Human; Male;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-Non-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  98073324<p>UPDATE CODE:  199803<p>Record 46 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Dysphagia in children with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Yokochi-K; Terasawa-S; Kono-C; Fujishima-I<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Rehabilitation, Ohzora Hospital, Shizuoka,Japan.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Dysphagia. 1997 Fall; 12(4): 222-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0179-051X<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Feeding difficulty necessitating tube feeding after the infantileperiod was seen in 3 children with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum.Videofluorographic imaging showed impaired pharyngeal function, which wasthought to result from dysplasia of the pharyngeal muscles.

We present aquantitative analysis of volumetric changes after distraction osteogenesis in aseries of 10 patients. Group I (n = 5 patients, 3 unilateral craniofacialmicrosomia, 1 Goldenhaar syndrome, and 1 bilateral craniofacial microsomia)underwent unilateral distraction of the mandible. Group II (n = 5 patients, 1Nager syndrome, 1 bilateral craniofacial microsomia, 1 developmentalmicrognathia, and 2 Treacher Collins syndrome) underwent bilateral distractionof the mandible. Predistraction and postdistraction axial and three-dimensionalcomputed tomographic (CT) scans were digitized and transferred to a computerfor analysis with image-processing software to determine the changes in volumeof the mandible and bony regenerate. The CT-derived volume method was validatedby scanning three dry cadaver mandible specimens and comparing the volume datawith those derived from a water-displacement method. The difference between thetwo methods was less than 5 percent. The mean distracted length, as recordedfrom the calibrated device, was 22.6 mm in the 10 patients. In the unilateraldistraction group, the mean increase in hemimandibular bone volume was 2.8 cc,with a mean percentage increase of 27 percent in the distracted hemimandible.In the bilaterally distracted patients, the mean increase in total mandibularvolume was 7.9 cc, with a mean percentage increase in bone volume of 25percent. This study represents the first attempt to quantify the increase inbone volume resulting from distraction osteogenesis. Quantitative volumetricanalysis of CT scans is an accurate method to measure the amount of boneregenerate in patients undergoing distraction osteogenesis of the mandible orthe extremities. The concept and utility of quantifying the volumetric changesin bone following distraction osteogenesis may become more important asmultiplanar devices are developed and used in other areas of the craniofacialskeleton.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Bone-Regeneration; Cadaver-;Child-; Child,-Preschool; Facial-Asymmetry-surgery; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery;Image-Processing,-Computer-Assisted; Mandible-abnormalities;Mandible-pathology; Mandible-surgery; Mandibulofacial-Dysostosis-surgery;Micrognathism-surgery; Radiographic-Image-Enhancement;Reproducibility-of-Results; Syndrome-; Water-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Bone-Lengthening-methods; *Mandible-radiography;*Osteogenesis-; *Tomography,-X-Ray-Computed<p>CHECKTAGS:  Comparative-Study; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  7732-18-5<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Water<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  97259230<p>UPDATE CODE:  199707<p>SUBSET:  AIM<p>Record 53 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1997-1999<p>TITLE:  Airway management in children with craniofacial anomalies.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Perkins-JA; Sie-KC; Milczuk-H; Richardson-MA<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Medical Corps, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck SurgeryService, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, Washington, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Cleft-Palate-Craniofac-J. 1997 Mar; 34(2):135-40<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1055-6656<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Craniofacial anomalies (CFA) predispose children to airwayobstruction.

The type of airway intervention, duration of intervention, andassociated physical and medical conditions were evaluated. One hundred ninepatients had charts available for review and met inclusion criteria. Sixty-fiveof these patients required airway management, most commonly in the first monthof life, ranging from positioning to tracheotomy. Nineteen patients required atracheotomy.

Theoculoauriculovertebral spectrum (OAVS) has been used to describe a broaderrange of first and second branchial-arch defects including hemifacialmicrosomia and Goldenhar's syndrome. A combination of FNM and OAVS has beendescribed in the literature in 13 cases. This condition has been labeled as theoculoauriculofrontonasal syndrome, as well as ophthalmofrontonasal dysplasia.We have evaluated four patients with both FNM and OAVS. The pattern ofmalformation involves only the craniofacies: they have no vertebral defects,heart disease, or encephaloceles. The categorization of these four individualsand those in the literature raises interesting issues regarding syndromeclassification. Originally, it was suggested that perhaps this disorder was avariation of Goldenhar's syndrome. However, now that it has become evident thatFNM and OAVS are malformation patterns of etiologic and presumably pathogeneticheterogeneity, a more likely hypothesis is that when these two defects occurtogether, this represents a unique syndrome pattern. The purpose of thisarticle is to suggest that the combination of OAVS and FNM may be a distinctentity, representing a discreet subset of patients.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Child,-Preschool;Frontal-Bone-abnormalities; Goldenhar-Syndrome-classification; Syndrome-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Craniofacial-Abnormalities-classification;*Craniofacial-Abnormalities-pathology; *Ear,-External-abnormalities;*Eyelids-abnormalities; *Facial-Asymmetry-pathology; *Nose-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE; REVIEW; REVIEW-OF-REPORTED-CASES<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  97093917<p>UPDATE CODE:  199704<p>SUBSET:  DENTAL<p>Record 61 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  [Familial occurrence of oculoauricolovertebral dysplasia andFranceschetti syndrome]<p>ORIGINAL TITLE:  Familiare Haufung von okuloaurikulovertebraler Dysplasie undFranceschetti-Syndrom.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Bestelmeyer-U; Weerda-H; Siegert-R; Greiwe-M; Schwinger-E<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Institut fur Humangenetik, Medizinischen Universitat zuLubeck.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  HNO. 1996 Aug; 44(8): 452-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0017-6192<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  GERMAN; NON-ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  Oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia (OAV) and the Franceschettisyndrome (FS) are well-known complexes of anomalies that have dysplasias of theexternal ear as a common occurrence. In this study the specific patterns ofsymptoms and familial occurrences of 100 patients with external ear dysplasiaswere examined (88 patients with OAV dysplasia and 12 patients with FS).Analyzing the pedigree data of the probands, we ascertained the relatives withstriking symptoms and associated anomalies of OAV dysplasia. The aim of thisstudy was to determine the influence of genetic transmission on OAV dysplasiain comparison to FS. A striking family history was found in 66.6% of thepatients with FS. In 26.1%, family members of patients with OAV dysplasia hadexternal ear dysplasias or other striking symptoms of OAV dysplasia. In thiscomplex of anomalies we also found a higher frequency of skeletal deformitiesand congenital heart defects than in the normal population. On the basis of ourresults we suggest that there is a genetic transmission in patients with FS aswell as in some cases with OAV dysplasia. Our findings show that it isabsolutely necessary to analyze family history very carefully when discussingthe recurrence risk or risk of genetic transmission.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Child-; Child,-Preschool;English-Abstract; Genetic-Screening; Heterozygote-Detection; Risk-Factors<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Ear,-External-abnormalities;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  English-Abstract; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96398161<p>UPDATE CODE:  199702<p>Record 62 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum and the CHARGE association: clinicalevidence for a common pathogenetic mechanism.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Van-Meter-TD; Weaver-DD<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, IndianaUniversity School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5251, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Clin-Dysmorphol. 1996 Jul; 5(3): 187-96<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0962-8827<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  We describe two infants with features of both theoculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) and the CHARGE association (CA). Bothpatients are more severely affected than the typical patient with the OAVS.Each has facial asymmetry, mandibular hypoplasia, ear abnormalities, hearingimpairment, microphthalmia, heart defects, and developmental delay. They alsohave features that are not characteristic of either OAVS or CA includingtorticollis, plagiocephaly, and heminostril. Based on the findings of thesepatients and other reported in the literature, there appears to be asignificant overlap of features between OAVS and CA, and we suggest that theseconditions in fact may be produced by the same pathogenetic mechanism. One suchmechanism to explain the overlap of these disorders is that both conditions arepart of the axial mesodermal spectrum, and represent a dysblastogeneticprocess. This mechanism may also explain the presence of some of the additionalfeatures not normally seen in OAVs and CA but seen in these two infants.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Abnormalities,-Multiple-classification;Abnormalities,-Multiple-physiopathology; Diagnosis,-Differential;Follow-Up-Studies; Goldenhar-Syndrome-classification;Goldenhar-Syndrome-physiopathology; Infant-; Infant,-Newborn<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-diagnosis;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96415521<p>UPDATE CODE:  199702<p>Record 63 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Abnormalities of the spine in Goldenhar's syndrome.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Gibson-JN; Sillence-DO; Taylor-TK<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Sydney, Australia.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-Pediatr-Orthop. 1996 May-Jun; 16(3):344-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0271-6798<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  The vertebral abnormalities present in 35 patients diagnosed withGoldenhar's syndrome are reported.

The combinationof Goldenhar and one or the two others is rare, whereas the concomitantoccurrence of Mobius and hypoglossia-hypodactyly, and/or Poland, and/orKlippel-Feil anomaly is well known. Pathogenetically, vascular disruptionsaround the 4th embryonic week have been hypothesized. In vivo and pathologicalstudies as well as animal models support this theory for all theabove-mentioned combinations. Whether a preceding blastogenetic alteration isan influencing factor or a disorganization mutation, remains unclear. Wedescribe a 3-year-old girl with bilateral anotia, epidermoid on the right eye,6th and 7th nerve palsy, hypoglossia, left hypodactyly, and ventricular septaldefect. CONCLUSION: We wish to emphasize the aetiological relevance of vasculardisruptions in this previously unreported combination of Mobius, Goldenhar andhypoglossia-hypodactyly anomalies. The concurrence of anomalies in this patientrepresents an association and not a pleiotropic syndrome.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child,-Preschool; Cranial-Nerve-Diseases-complications;Goldenhar-Syndrome-complications; Syndrome-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abducens-Nerve; *Abnormalities,-Multiple; *Facial-Nerve;*Fingers-abnormalities; *Goldenhar-Syndrome; *Tongue-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96302961<p>UPDATE CODE:  199612<p>Record 68 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  [The use of 3-dimensional models in craniofacial surgery]<p>ORIGINAL TITLE:  Het gebruik van driedimensionale modellen in de craniofacialechirurgie.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Wittkampf-AR; Zonneveld-FW<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Afd.

There are many other organsystem abnormalities which may be present. However, the literature does notemphasize craniofacial findings except with reference to the typical earconfiguration. A three-generation family is described in which craniofacialmanifestations were prominent and a Goldenhar-like condition was considered asthe most likely diagnosis. However, with the recent birth of an affected malewho had an imperforate anus, the diagnosis of TBS was also considered. Thefamily manifests a variety of Goldenhar-like findings, including epibulbardermoids, hemifacial microsomia, preauricular tags, macrostomia, andmicrognathia in addition to classical ear, radial, and anal findings of TBS. Wereport on this family to point out a possible biological relationship of thesetwo conditions.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adult-; Anus-abnormalities; Child-; Dermoid-Cyst;Ear-abnormalities; Facial-Asymmetry; Facial-Bones-abnormalities; Infant-;Infant,-Newborn; Middle-Age; Pedigree-; Syndrome-; Thumb-abnormalities<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-diagnosis;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-diagnosis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96264114<p>UPDATE CODE:  199610<p>Record 70 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Vertical orbital dystopia.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Tan-ST; Ashworth-G; Czypionka-S; Poole-MD; Briggs-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Oxford Craniofacial Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, England.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Plast-Reconstr-Surg. 1996 Jun; 97(7):1349-61<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0032-1052<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Many pathologic processes may lead to vertical orbital dystopia. Wereviewed 47 consecutive cases seen over a 13-year period. Twenty-nine patientsunderwent eye leveling procedures to improve cosmesis, 2 of these by camouflageprocedures and 27 by orbital translocation. Ten patients had 16 secondaryoperations. There was one death, serious complications occurred in 3 patients,and nuisance complications occurred in 20 others. Seven patients developeddiplopia postoperatively, and in 6 patients it was troublesome. In these, itresolved fully in 2 patients, improved to be of no consequence in 2, and in theremaining 2 troublesome symptoms persisted requiring inferior oblique musclerecession in 1. Binocular vision was never restored when not presentpreoperatively, and in 3 patients temporary loss occurred. There was an overallmodest but significant improvement in appearance after surgery. It is concludedthat vertical orbital translocation is rewarding and worthwhile.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Abnormalities,-Multiple; Adolescence-; Adult-; Child-;Child,-Preschool; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery; Infant-; Middle-Age;Postoperative-Complications; Surgery,-Plastic-methods;Vision-Disorders-etiology<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Craniofacial-Dysostosis-surgery; *Orbit-abnormalities;*Orbit-surgery; *Surgery,-Plastic<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96238004<p>UPDATE CODE:  199609<p>SUBSET:  AIM<p>Record 71 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Surgical repair of d-transposition with aortopulmonary window: a casereport.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Marangi-D; Peterson-RJ; Ceithaml-EL; Marvin-WJ Jr<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Division of Pediatric Cardiology, University of FloridaHealth Science Center, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-Thorac-Cardiovasc-Surg. 1996 Mar; 111(3):671-2<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0022-5223<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Goldenhar-Syndrome; Infant,-Newborn<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Aortopulmonary-Septal-Defect-surgery;*Transposition-of-Great-Vessels-surgery<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE; REVIEW; REVIEW-OF-REPORTED-CASES<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96176937<p>UPDATE CODE:  199607<p>SUBSET:  AIM<p>Record 72 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Distraction osteogenesis in maxillofacial surgery using internaldevices: review of five cases.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Chin-M; Toth-BA<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  J-Oral-Maxillofac-Surg. 1996 Jan; 54(1):45-53; discussion 54<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0278-2391<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to show the feasibility andpotential advantages of using internal devices for distraction osteogenesis inthe management of maxillofacial skeletal deficiencies. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Distraction osteogenesis was used to correct a variety of maxillofacialskeletal deformities in five patients. One patient underwent bilateral Le FortIII advancement aided by distraction, three patients underwent mandibular ramuslengthening, and one patient underwent segmental alveolar reconstruction bydistraction. The devices were activated by either a transcutaneous ortransmucosal pin. After achievement of the desired skeletal transport, theactivating pins were disengaged and removed from the distraction device. Thisallowed the distraction device to remain submerged and to stabilize the site ofthe consolidating bone. RESULTS: All patients achieved lengthening of theirjaws. However, premature consolidation was noted in two patients, and onepatient had significant relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Development of internaldistraction devices is important to address the limitations of currentlyavailable biphasic systems. Potential benefits of internal devices include 1)elimination of skin scarring caused by translation of transcutaneous fixationpins, 2) improved patient compliance during the fixation or consolidation phasebecause there is no external component, and 3) improved stability of theattachment of the device to the bone.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Acrocephalosyndactylia-surgery; Adolescence-; Child-;Child,-Preschool; Feasibility-Studies; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery; Infant-;Microstomia-surgery; Osteogenesis-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Bone-Lengthening-instrumentation; *Internal-Fixators;*Jaw-surgery; *Micrognathism-surgery; *Osteotomy-instrumentation<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96135025<p>UPDATE CODE:  199604<p>SUBSET:  AIM; DENTAL<p>Record 73 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Fibreoptic intubation via a laryngeal mask in an infant with Goldenharsyndrome [letter; comment]<p>COMMENTS:  Comment on: Anaesth Intensive Care 1994 Apr;22(2):194-7<p>AUTHOR(S):  Haxby-EJ; Liban-JB<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Anaesth-Intensive-Care. 1995 Dec; 23(6):753<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0310-057X<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  AUSTRALIA<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Bronchoscopes-; Bronchoscopy-instrumentation;Bronchoscopy-methods; Equipment-Design; Fiber-Optics; Infant-;Intubation,-Intratracheal-instrumentation; Surface-Properties<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome; *Intubation,-Intratracheal-methods;*Laryngeal-Masks<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  COMMENT; LETTER<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96238450<p>UPDATE CODE:  199610<p>SUBSET:  NURSING<p>Record 74 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Neurodevelopmental profile of infants and toddlers withoculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum and the correlation of prognosis withphysical findings.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Cohen-MS; Samango-Sprouse-CA; Stern-HJ; Custer-DA; Vaught-DR;Saal-HM; Tifft-CJ; Rosenbaum-KN<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Medical Genetics, Children's National MedicalCenter, Washington, DC 20010-2970, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Am-J-Med-Genet. 1995 Dec 18; 60(6): 535-40<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0148-7299<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  We studied the neurodevelopmental profile of infants and toddlerswith oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAV) and determined if certain physicalmanifestations were indicative of a poor neurodevelopmental prognosis.Twenty-four patients with OAV, aged birth to 57 months, were seen in theDepartment of Medical Genetics at Children's National Medical Center formultidisciplinary evaluations, including neurodevelopmental assessments.Fifty-eight percent of these children scored more than 2 standard deviationsbelow the mean in at least one domain of development. There was no differencein developmental outcome of boys versus girls, children affected unilaterallyon the right side versus left side, and those with severe clinicalmanifestations versus those with a milder form. Children with OAV and abnormalmuscle tone had lower cognitive, gross motor, and expressive language scores (P= 0.05, P = 0.002, and P = 0.02, respectively). Those affected bilaterally hadlower cognitive, fine motor, receptive language, and expressive language scores(P = 0.06, P = 0.03, P = 0.03, P = 0.02, respectively). Children with cervicalspine abnormalities had lower cognitive, fine motor, and expressive languagescores (P = 0.02, P = 0.04, and P = 0.04, respectively). We conclude thatinfants and toddlers with OAV are at increased risk for neurodevelopmentaldelay, especially those with abnormal muscle tone, bilateral involvement, andcervical vertebral anomalies. The complexity of the neurodevelopmental problemsis strongly suggestive of central nervous system disturbances. Patients withOAV need comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team to definepotential neurodevelopmental delays, allow for early intervention services, andpromote an optimal developmental outcome.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child,-Preschool; Evoked-Potentials,-Auditory; Infant-;Intelligence-Tests; Motor-Activity; Prognosis-<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Goldenhar-Syndrome-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96423290<p>UPDATE CODE:  199702<p>Record 75 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Syringohydromyelia as a complication of Goldenhar syndrome [seecomments]<p>COMMENTS:  Comment in: Childs Nerv Syst 1996 Jun;12(6):291<p>AUTHOR(S):  Inci-S; Saglam-S<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurosurgery, Hacettepe University, MedicalSchool, Ankara, Turkey.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Childs-Nerv-Syst. 1995 Dec; 11(12): 708-11<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0256-7040<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  Goldenhar syndrome is a multifocal developmental disorder consistingof ocular, auricular and vertebral anomalies.

A secondpatient with a neoplastic corneal lesion underwent limbal allotransplantation,followed later by a second procedure in which 360 degrees of limbus and theentire ocular surface was transplanted. A third patient who had sufferedextensive chemical burns was treated by penetrating keratoplasty to restorecentral corneal clarity, followed later by a lamellar allograft comprising a360 degrees annulus of peripheral cornea to repair the ocular surface. A fourthpatient with long standing, chronic trachomatous eye disease underwentallotransplantation of the upper lid tarsal plate and conjunctiva, withreconstruction of the fornix. Finally, a child with Goldenhar's syndromeunderwent reconstruction of the medial fornix with autologous buccal mucosa,followed by a lamellar corneal and conjunctival allograft. A stable ocularsurface has been achieved in each case and there have been no obvious rejectionepisodes. CONCLUSION--Limbal allotransplantation can be extended to engraftmentof the entire superficial cornea, limbus, conjunctiva, and tarsal plate inpatients with a range of pathologies. We have described the surgical managementof five cases which demonstrate the potential of the technique, but which raisequestions which still need to be explored.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adult-; Aged-; Carcinoma-in-Situ-surgery;Child,-Preschool; Contact-Lenses,-Hydrophilic-adverse-effects;Corneal-Diseases-etiology; Eye-Neoplasms-surgery; Limbus-Corneae; Middle-Age;Transplantation,-Homologous<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Burns,-Chemical-surgery; *Conjunctiva-transplantation;*Corneal-Diseases-surgery; *Eye-Burns-surgery; *Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery;*Stem-Cells-transplantation<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96137895<p>UPDATE CODE:  199604<p>Record 80 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Oculoauriculovertebral spectrum: new manifestations.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Johnson-KA; Fairhurst-J; Clarke-NM<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Radiology, Southampton General Hospital,UK.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Pediatr-Radiol. 1995; 25(6): 446-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0301-0449<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  We present a case of oculoauriculovertebral spectrum (hemifacialmicrosomia, Goldenhar's syndrome) found shortly after birth with right iliachypoplasia, absent right pubic and ischial ossification centres and posteriorurethral valves, which have not previously been described in this spectrum.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Ilium-abnormalities; Infant,-Newborn<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple; *Facial-Asymmetry;*Goldenhar-Syndrome; *Pelvic-Bones-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  96071238<p>UPDATE CODE:  199603<p>Record 81 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Tracheoesophageal anomalies in oculoauriculovertebral (Goldenhar)spectrum.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Sutphen-R; Galan-Gomez-E; Cortada-X; Newkirk-PN; Kousseff-BG<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatrics, University of South Florida,Tampa 33617-3451, USA.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Clin-Genet. 1995 Aug; 48(2): 66-71<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0009-9163<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  DENMARK<p>ABSTRACT:  Tracheoesophageal fistula, with or without esophageal atresia(TEF/EA) appears to be a defect of blastogenesis, as is theoculoauriculovertebral (Goldenhar) spectrum (OAVS), with which it hasoccasionally been associated.

There had beenepibulbar dermoids in his left eye, strabismus, bilateral multiple preauricularappendices, malar hypoplasia, micrognathia, hemifacial microsoma and highpalatal vault. In addition to congenital anomalies and developmental delay,blond hair, fair skin and unusual urinary odor were noted.

Goldenhar syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia) isassociated with anomalies in multiple organ systems. Renal abnormalities havealso been reported with the complex, but the incidence of associatedgenitourinary malformations has not been defined. METHOD. We have reviewed ourexperience with 28 children with Goldenhar syndrome evaluated during the pasttwelve years. Twenty children underwent imaging evaluation of the urinary tractand 14 (70% of those imaged) children had urinary tract anomalies. RESULTS. Themajority of anomalies presented as an incidental finding on a screeningultrasound (8 patients) or during cardiac catheterization (2 patients). Twochildren presented with urinary tract infection, 1 child presented with renalfailure, and another was diagnosed antenatally. The genitourinary anomaliesincluded the following: ectopic and/or fused kidneys (8 patients), renalagenesis (7), vesicoureteral reflux (5), ureteropelvic junction obstruction(2), ureteral duplication (2), and multicystic kidney (1 patient). Fourchildren have undergone surgical intervention. CONCLUSION. Our experience inchildren with Goldenhar syndrome suggests that the incidence of genitourinaryanomalies is higher than previously reported. A screening ultrasound in theneonatal period allows for early intervention in those children withsignificant urologic abnormalities.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Child-; Child,-Preschool; Incidence-; Infant-;Infant,-Newborn<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Abnormalities,-Multiple-epidemiology;*Goldenhar-Syndrome; *Urogenital-Abnormalities;*Urogenital-System-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  94112802<p>UPDATE CODE:  199404<p>Record 89 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Goldenhar's syndrome--a case report.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Singh-A; Malhotra-G; Singh-GP; Mander-KJ; Gulati-SK<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery,Government Medical College, Rajendra Hospital, Punjab, India.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Acta-Chir-Plast. 1994; 36(4): 111-3<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0001-5423<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1994<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  CZECH-REPUBLIC<p>ABSTRACT:  A case of Goldenhar's syndrome in a three months old male child withepibulbar dermoid (Fig. 1), accessory auricular appendages (Fig. 2), transversefacial cleft (Figs. 1 and 3), pedunculated mass on the left cheek (Figs. 2 and3), asymmetry of skull (Fig. 4) and imperforate anus (already operated) ispresented.

Maxillofacial abnormalities are classified ascongenital, growth-related and acquired. Congenital deformities include thealterations present at birth, i.e., craniofacial stenosis, oto-mandibularsyndrome. Treacher-Collins and Goldenhar syndrome, facial clefts and lip-palateclefts. Growth-related malformations include the deformities appearing duringgrowth and which are called maxillary dysmorphosis, e.g., hemimandibularhyperplasia, prognathism, maxillary hypoplasia, etc. Acquired malformations arethose remaining after trauma or cancer surgery and those which are secondary tofibrous dysplasias of the craniofacial complex. May 1990 through May 1993,forty-two patients with different malformations were examined. Themalformations secondary to cancer surgery were not included in our series. Aradiologic study including conventional skull radiography, teleradiography andpanoramic tomography had been performed for preliminary assessment before axialCT studies and 2D and 3D reconstructions. As for our series, in 20 patientscoventional radiology was exhaustive to diagnose the disorder and to supplyessential elements for treatment planning while axial CT and 3D reconstructionsadded no further piece of information. Only in the most complex malformationsand in all cases of congenital malformations was axial CT needed to assess thetype, extent and entity of the malformations allowing both the diagnosis andadequate surgical planning.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Cephalometry-methods; Child-;English-Abstract; Goldenhar-Syndrome-radiography;Image-Processing,-Computer-Assisted; Mandible-abnormalities;Mandible-radiography; Maxilla-abnormalities; Maxilla-radiography;Radiography,-Panoramic; Temporomandibular-Joint-injuries;Temporomandibular-Joint-radiography; Tomography,-X-Ray-Computed-methods<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Facial-Bones-abnormalities; *Facial-Bones-radiography;*Jaw-Abnormalities-radiography; *Mandibulofacial-Dysostosis-radiography;*Maxillofacial-Development<p>CHECKTAGS:  English-Abstract; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  95183743<p>UPDATE CODE:  199506<p>Record 92 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  [Difficult intubation due to facial malformations in a child.

These patients are admitted formandibulofacial and otolaryngologic surgery. It is important to inspect thepatient's outer and inner pharyngeal structures carefully during preoperativeassessment, as suggested by Mallampati. The observer estimates the facility ofintubation by inspection of the faucial pillars, soft palate, and uvula.Unfortunately, even careful examination does not predict every case ofdifficult intubation, so that unexpected problems may occur. There may also bedifficulties in ventilating these patients with a face mask. Safe intubation ispossible in these cases using the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), laryngoscopywith a rigid optical aid, and the fibreoptic bronchoscope. Case report. Wereport a 14-month-old girl with Goldenhar's syndrome (oculo-auriculardysplasia) who presented for soft-palate surgery. This syndrome belongs to thegroup of cranio-mandibular-facial malformations; the main symptoms arecongenital unilateral malformations in the area of the 1st and 2nd branchialarches. The patient's jaw was hypoplastic with aplasia of thetemporo-mandibular joint, which led to asymmetry of the lower face and anextremely short mandible. Additionally, we observed a large tongue in relationto the small jaw. Macrostomia is part of the syndrome, and may lead tounderestimation of intubation problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Bronchoscopy-; English-Abstract; Fiber-Optics;Goldenhar-Syndrome-radiography; Goldenhar-Syndrome-surgery; Infant-;Laryngoscopy-; Palate,-Soft-radiography; Palate,-Soft-surgery<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Anesthesia,-Inhalation;*Goldenhar-Syndrome-complications; *Intubation,-Intratracheal-methods;*Laryngeal-Masks<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; English-Abstract; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  95142408<p>UPDATE CODE:  199505<p>Record 93 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  [Fiberscopic intubation under general anesthesia for children withGoldenhar syndrome]<p>AUTHOR(S):  Okuyama-M; Imai-M; Fujisawa-E; Okuyama-A; Kemmotsu-O<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, HokkaidoUniversity School of Medicine, Sapporo.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Masui. 1994 Dec; 43(12): 1885-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0021-4892<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1994<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  JAPANESE; NON-ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  JAPAN<p>ABSTRACT:  Goldenhar syndrome is characterised by an eye abnormality such asepibulbar dermoid and lipoma, associated with ear, mandibular, and/or vertebralanomalies. It is well documented that difficult intubation in patient with thissyndrome may be expected because of mandibular hypoplasia and limitation ofneck movement resulting from vertebral anomalies. We report anestheticmanagement of two children with Goldenhar syndrome, 9 and 14-year-old. Bypreoperative examination, two children were expected to be difficult inintubating trachea. We used our newly developed mask adapter which enabled usto perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy-aided tracheal intubation under generalanesthesia under controlled ventilation. By using this adapter, undersevoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia with vecuronium, we could successfullyintubate with a 6 mm spiral tube through the nostril without any majorproblems. Anesthesia and surgery went uneventfully, and no postoperativecomplications were noted. We confirmed that our newly developed mask adapterfor fiberoptic bronchoscopy is as useful for children with difficult intubationas for adults.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Bronchoscopy-; Child-; English-Abstract;Fiber-Optics<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Anesthesia,-General; *Goldenhar-Syndrome;*Intubation,-Intratracheal-instrumentation<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; English-Abstract; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  95139219<p>UPDATE CODE:  199505<p>Record 94 of 99 in MEDLINE EXPRESS (R) 1994-1996<p>TITLE:  Familial hemifacial microsomia due to autosomal dominant inheritance.Case reports.<p>AUTHOR(S):  Singer-SL; Haan-E; Slee-J; Goldblatt-J<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Dental Department, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth,Western Australia.<p>SOURCE (BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION):  Aust-Dent-J. 1994 Oct; 39(5): 287-91<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0045-0421<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1994<p>LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE:  ENGLISH<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  AUSTRALIA<p>ABSTRACT:  Hemifacial microsomia is a rare dentofacial anomaly which isregarded as a separate entity to Goldenhar syndrome and primarily affects thestructures of the first branchial arch.

Medical records and cephalograms were reviewed from 18 patients withclassic Goldenhar syndrome and from 18 normal adults. One patient, a22-year-old man, had experienced a 5-year history of progressive neurologiccompromise from basilar impression; the remaining 17 patients wereasymptomatic. Radiographic evidence of cervicovertebral fusion was documentedin 11 of 18 patients (61 percent). Fusion occurred at every cervical levelother than the atlantoaxial joint. Radiographic indices that characterize thecranial base were not significantly different between asymptomatic Goldenharpatients and normal adults. Posterior inclination of the odontoid with respectto the foramen magnum appears to be the best indicator that a patient is atrisk for basilar impression. Careful radiographic evaluation may indicate whichpatients require more careful surveillance with periodic neurologic examinationand CT and/or MRI scans.<p>MINOR MESH HEADINGS:  Adolescence-; Adult-;Atlanto-Occipital-Joint-abnormalities; Atlanto-Occipital-Joint-pathology;Atlanto-Occipital-Joint-radiography; Atlas-abnormalities; Atlas-pathology;Atlas-radiography; Axis-abnormalities; Axis-pathology; Axis-radiography;Cephalometry-methods; Cervical-Vertebrae-pathology;Cervical-Vertebrae-radiography; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Foramen-Magnum-pathology; Foramen-Magnum-radiography;Goldenhar-Syndrome-radiography; Infant-; Occipital-Bone-pathology;Occipital-Bone-radiography; Odontoid-Process-abnormalities;Odontoid-Process-pathology; Odontoid-Process-radiography; Risk-Factors;Spinal-Cord-Compression-etiology<p>MAJOR MeSH HEADINGS:  *Cervical-Vertebrae-abnormalities;*Foramen-Magnum-abnormalities; *Goldenhar-Syndrome-pathology;*Occipital-Bone-abnormalities<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  JOURNAL-ARTICLE<p>MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER:  94159744<p>UPDATE CODE:  199406<p>SUBSET:  AIM<p><hr><A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~pietsch/home.html">go to Shufflebrain main menu</A><p><A href="mailto:pietsch@indiana.edu"><B>web contact:</B>pietsch@indiana.edu</A></body></html>
