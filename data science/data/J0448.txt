1978 Mercury Cougar
<BR>
351M Motor - Paid $100.00
<br>
After cutting away a lot of metal around the fenders and swapping tires, the cars was ready for the demo derby.
<br>
About 1/2 way through the heat, the car stalled and wouldn't start.  Smoke started coming out from the battery.
<br>
Turns out I shattered a battery terminal into 3 pieces. I replaced the terminal and ran in the consulation heat.
<br>
Both sides of the frame had given way right in the middle of the car and were hanging down about 2" from the ground.
<br>
I decided to use the frontend, as much as possible.  Ended up putting the fan through the radiator.
<br>
The motor got hot, stalled and wouldn't start.  I was able to get it running in the pits and drove it on to the trailer.
