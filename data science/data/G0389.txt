My question deals with a famous example explaining the relativity of
time. Two twins say goodbye to each other before a rocket. One gets in,
blasts off at close the speed of light and when the onboard clock shows
she has been gone one year she returns to Earth to find that her twin
has aged 50 years. My question is this: can't you imagine that from the
standpoint of the spaceship, it was Earth that zoomed backward at near
the speed of light and therefore the Earthbound twin that should have
experienced a 'time warp'?<P>

<B>In this classic paradox, the roles of rocketeer and stay-at-home
are not interchangeable.  The reason is that the twin who flies off to
another star at nearly the speed of light must accelerate as she leaves
the Earth, then eventually decelerate to turn around, accelerate again
to come back home, and decelerate again to stop when arriving at Earth.
When accelerating and decelerating, the space-traveler is not at rest
with respect to the "inertial frame" of the universe, and indeed must
expend considerable energy (rocket fuel or whatever) to accomplish this.
While the twin on the rocket ship might look backward and imagine that
it is the Earth (and her brother there) that is accelerating away from
her, this is not actually the case -- the lazy brother on Earth just
sits there at rest with regard to the inertial frame of the universe
and lets his sister do all the work.  The "proof" of this is that the
sister will feel "G-forces" as her rocket accelerates, while her brother
won't feel any such thing, demonstrating that their situations are not
strictly reversible.<BR>

My question pertains to the blackhole in the universe. How many are
there? How are they formed? And it is my understanding that the
magnetic field prohibits light from passing thru thus enabling us from
seeing thru? Is this correct?<P>

<B>We don't know how many black holes there are in the universe -- while
the concept of the black hole has been around for quite some time, it
is only very recently that astronomers have found solid (if still somewhat
indirect) evidence that they truly exist.   It is believed that black holes
form when a very massive star (much more massive than our sun) exhausts
its nuclear fuel and collapses under the force of its own gravity.
During this collapse, the core of the star is crushed, achieving such
high density that its gravitational field prevents all light and matter
from escaping it.   It is gravity, not magnetism, that prevents us from
seeing a black hole directly.  However, this gravity has a powerful
effect on matter nearby the black hole, and observational evidence for
their existence comes from measurements of material (gas and/or starlight)
moving at tremendously high velocities in the vicinity.<P>

Ultra-massive black holes apparently also exist in the cores of some,
perhaps many, galaxies -- black holes with masses ranging from a million
to a billion times that of our sun.  Exactly how these formed, we do not
know: it may taken place during the original gravitational collapse of
material during the formation of the galaxy itself, or perhaps such
later when gas and other matter gets funneled to the center of the galaxy
due to interactions with other neighboring galaxies.  Recent Hubble Space
Telescope observations, as well as other data from ground-based telescopes,
have shown that their presence in some nearby galaxies is almost a certainty.<BR>

The way I understand it Einstein says that nothing can exceed the speed
of light.  If a Black hole sucks everything into it including light,
would not the things being sucked in be going faster then 186,000 per
second, owing to the fact of something like the venturi effect?<P>



<B>No, as the t-shirts say, "186,000 miles per second -- it's not just
a good idea, it's the law."   Even falling into a black hole, the speed
of light represents a maximum speed limit in the universe.  Objects
may accelerate toward the speed of light as they fall into a black hole,
but they cannot exceed it.<BR>

It is known that the universe is expanding from the implications of the
red shifts of observable light. What could be seen or found out if one
was to observe the shift of light further up the spectrum. For example,
is there such a thing as an infrared shift. (either in reality or
hypothetically.)What would the implications of this type of observation
be?  Also is there any evidence for anything beyond the obsevable
universe and if so how can it be studied if nothing can go faster then
the speed of light.<P>

<B>Light is just part of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic waves with wavelengths shorter than light are called
ultraviolet radiation, and shorter than this are the x-rays and gamma
rays.  At wavelengths longer than that of visible light we find infrared
radiation, and then microwaves and radio waves.<P>

The Doppler shift, or "red-shift," produced when an object is moving
away from us, affects all radiation -- not just visible light, but also
radio waves, microwaves, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, x-rays and
gamma rays.  All are shifted "redward," that is to say that their
wavelengths are "stretched" longer.  Blue light from a moderately distant
galaxy is shifted to become red light, while red light is shifted into
the infrared.  The infrared light from a galaxy is shifted too.  For
the most distant galaxies we know today, their visible light is
shifted all the way into the infrared, requiring special instruments
to observe them at those wavelengths, and their infrared light gets
shifted into radio wavelengths known as the "sub-millimeter" regime.<BR>

I have a couple of questions. First if the universe is expanding were
is it expanding to?  Next were is the Milky Way in the universe and
what is it's closest galaxy? How far away is it?<P>


<B>One can imagine two answers to your first question.  First, if the universe
is infinite, then it doesn't really "need" anything to expand into.
After all, two times infinity is still infinity!  An infinite universe
can keep expanding indefinitely and remain infinite all the time.
Note that the universe was infinite beginning immediately from the time
of the Big Bang -- it has *always* been infinite, even as it expands!<P>

The second answer requires one to imagine another dimension beyond the
four (three of space and one of time) which we inhabit.  Not an easy
task, imagining a dimension which we cannot perceive!  Let's think of
it by analogy.   Imagine, for a moment, that the universe is merely
two-dimensional, and is confined to the surface of a sphere.  (So think
of the universe as the surface of a balloon -- a universe in which we can
only move right, left, forward and backward along that surface -- up and
down don't exist in this imaginary world -- but "space" in this universe
is curved in another dimension which its inhabitants can't really perceive.)
If the balloon inflates, then this model "universe" expands -- the surface
of the balloon grows with time, and any two points on the balloon move apart,
just as galaxies in our universe expand away from one another.  The
inhabitants of this imaginary universe cannot perceive this extra dimension
into which the universe is expanding -- in fact, for them, it simply does
not exist, except perhaps as a mathematical construct.   But they might
find this extra dimension a useful idea when trying to explain how their
universe is expanding.  For us, it is the same way -- we may imagine a
higher dimension "into" which our universe is expanding.  <P>

Concerning your second question:   according to the Big Bang theory,
our galaxy, the Milky Way does not occupy any particularly special place
in the universe -- there is no center or edge of the universe to define
any such special place.  The Milky Way is a galaxy like billions of
others.  We do know quite a bit about its immediate neighborhood, however.
Galaxies tend to gather together in groups, and occasionally in rich
clusters of thousands of galaxies.  The Milky Way is situated in a rather
modest collection of a few dozen galaxies which we call (somewhat
unimaginatively) "The Local Group."  There are two fairly big galaxies in
the Local Group -- the Milky Way, and its somewhat larger neighbor,
the Andromeda Galaxy (also called M31).   There are quite a few smaller
galaxies in the Local Group, mostly quite small dwarf systems.
The closest galaxies to the Milky Way are two "big dwarfs" which
orbit it as satellites, bound by its gravity.  These are called the
Large and Small Magellanic Clouds: they cannot be easily seen in the
sky from the continental United States but are visible from the southern
hemisphere.   (They are named after Ferdinand Magellan, the first
European explorer to see them on his travels to the southern hemisphere).<P>

The Large Magellanic cloud is about 180,000 light years away, and the
Small Magellanic Cloud is about 220,000 light years away.  The Andromeda
Galaxy, M31, is about 2,300,000 light years distant.<BR>

I am aware of the experimental evidence supporting  Einstein's theory
explaining the bending of starlight as it traverses the sun's
gravitational field. But, conceptually I have great difficulty
accepting the idea of the theory, e.g, the warping of space surrounding
the sun due to its intense gravitional field. But, my instinctive
response always is how can you warp what isn't there? What is being
warped?<P>

Was the possibilty of weak interactions between gravitational and
photon fields ever considered?  Would this alternative approach
necessarily violate the relativistic requirement that only particles of
zero mass move at "c" velocities.? And. therefore, forbids the
existence of such interactions.<P>

Can you shed any light on my dilemma?<P>

<B>Curved space is quite difficult to visualize, it's true!  It is perhaps
easiest to do it by analogy.  Imagine a two-dimensional universe, where
beings live in a "Flatland" (there is a classic novel with this title
which imagines just such a thing) where there is only left and right,
forward and backward, but no up and down -- a universe like a sheet of
paper.   If that paper is "flat," then for those beings that live there
geometry would work in the classical fashion imagined by the Greek
philosopher Euclid -- the "Euclidean" geometry we learn in school.
But you could also imagine that this "Flatland" was curved -- for example,
like the surface of a sphere.  In this case, geometry behaves differently,
and objects following "straight line" trajectories on this surface will
move differently than they would if the surface was flat.   The
curved space envisioned by Einstein's theory of general relativity is
like this -- space itself can be curved, warped and distorted by the
presence of large masses, and light, which travels in "straight lines"
through space, can actually be bent as it passes by such masses
because space itself is curved in the vicinity.<P>

It is one of the great hopes of physics that a "unified theory" can
be formulated which joins together the four fundamental forces:  gravity,
electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.  Such a
theory would offer a complete explanation for the interactions between
gravity and (for example) photons of light.   Despite much effort
throughout this century, however, we have yet to formulate such a
complete theory.<BR>
