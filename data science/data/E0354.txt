<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Advice For New Newsgroup Users </H2>
<P>If you have never spent time using Internet newsgroups,
  here is a little background and some advice.&nbsp; I
  suggest you read this before posting messages for the first
  time.&nbsp; At a minimum, read the Posting Advice section
  below. 
</P> 
<H4>What Are Newsgroups? </H4>
<P>Newsgroups are message forums where people with common
  interests can post questions, answers, comments, opinions,
  and so on.&nbsp; In some ways, it is like e-mail. Just as
  anyone can send you an e-mail message, anyone can post a
  message to a newsgroup.&nbsp; Unlike your personal e-mail,
  anyone who is interested can read the newsgroup messages. 
</P> 
<P>There are literally thousands of newsgroups available on
  the Internet.&nbsp; They are generally divided into topics,
  or groups, devoted to specific areas of interest or to
  general mayhem.&nbsp; The ones devoted to specific
  interests are sometimes &quot;monitored,&quot; that is,
  there are people who read the messages and delete those
  that are unacceptable, e.g., contain profanity or are
  &quot;off-topic&quot; (i.e., the message deals with subject
  matter not appropriate for the newsgroup).&nbsp; Other
  newsgroups are unmonitored. &nbsp;Be aware that unmonitored
  groups may contain messages that you find offensive. 
</P> 
<P>Just as you must configure or attach to an e-mail
  server, or &quot;post office,&quot; you must attach to a
  newsgroup server to read the messages stored there.&nbsp;
  Not all newsgroup servers are available to the public at
  large.&nbsp; For example, Borland operates a public
  newsgroup server for anyone who cares to use it as well as
  a private server for internal use and for beta customers to
  share information.&nbsp; Further, not all servers carry all
  newsgroups.&nbsp; For example, Borland's server carries
  only newsgroups relating to Borland products. 
</P> 
<P>To participate in Borland's newsgroups, you will need to
  set up your newsgroup reader to attach to: 
</P> 
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">forums.borland.com 
</P> 
<P>See your browser or newsgroup reader help file for
  information about adding a newsgroup server.&nbsp; Borland
  also provides information on setting up your newsgroup
  reader at
  <A HREF="http://www.borland.com/newsgroups/newsinfo.html"
	TARGET="_top">http://www.borland.com/newsgroups/newsinfo.html</A>.
  
</P> 
<H4>Posting Advice (And A Few Personal Opinions) </H4>
<P>These are my tips for happy newsgroup participation and
  improving the chances of getting your programming questions
  answered.&nbsp; Be aware that none of these are absolute
  requirements and, further, some of these suggestions are
  simply my opinion.&nbsp; They are also slanted toward the
  Borland programming newsgroups (and, I suppose, other
  newsgroups where people pose questions and ask for
  answers). 
</P> <UL>
<LI> <B>Read The Posting Guidelines FAQ.</B>&nbsp; Before
you post your first question to a newsgroup, see if you can
find a &quot;posting guidelines FAQ.&quot;&nbsp; This will
explain any rules the newsgroup may have.&nbsp; For
example, Borland's posting guidelines prohibit profanity,
forbid HTML posts, discourage excessively long messages,
and do not allow posting messages with binary attachments
(that is, non-plaintext files attached to messages).&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://www.borland.com/newsgroups/guide.html"
 TARGET="_top">Read the Borland Newsgroup Posting
Guidelines</A> <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Browse First.</B>&nbsp; Spend some time reading
messages before posting to a particular newsgroup for the
first time.&nbsp; This will give you a chance to get an
idea what topics are typically covered by the newsgroup and
who posts there regularly.&nbsp; In fact, you might find
your question already posted by someone else and,
hopefully, answered. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Search The Archives.</B>&nbsp; Before posting a
question, you might want to search a newsgroup archive to
see if the question has been previously asked and
answered.&nbsp; DejaNews is one such archive, but there are
others.&nbsp; DejaNews archives pretty much all public
newsgroups and it is free, so point your browser to
<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/"
 TARGET="_top">http://www.dejanews.com/</A> and give it a
try.&nbsp; <B>Note:&nbsp;</B>
<A HREF="http://www.google.com"
 TARGET="_top">Google.com</A> has taken over the DejaNews
newsgroup archives.<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>RTFM (Read The Fine Manual).</B>&nbsp; If you want
to jump into a newsgroup and pass yourself off as an
expert, just watch for a couple of days.&nbsp; You will
find countless questions that are easily answered by
searching the VCL and Windows API help files that ship with
Borland's C++ Builder.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you wish
to start out admitting that you are not an expert, I
suggest that you do a little research yourself.&nbsp; At a
minimum, search the help files.&nbsp; If you do that, you
may not find the answer that you need, but you will
probably learn a lot of things not directly related to your
question and you will be much better prepared to understand
answers to more difficult questions. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Make Your Message Subject Meaningful.</B>&nbsp;
Most of the real experts monitor more than one
newsgroup.&nbsp; Their time, like yours, is precious, so
they frequently read only those messages which have a
subject line that &quot;interests&quot; them or sounds like
something that they can help with.&nbsp; To improve your
chances of getting a useful answer to your question, use
meaningful subject lines in your posts.&nbsp; For example,
if your question is about how to solve a problem with Rich
Edit controls, include &quot;Rich Edit&quot; in the
subject.&nbsp; <I>Do not</I> use non-descriptive subject
lines such as &quot;Urgent!,&quot; &quot;Help!,&quot;
&quot;How Do I Do This?,&quot; &quot;Must Have An Answer By
Monday,&quot; &quot;I Am Truly Lost!,&quot; or the like
without including the real topic.&nbsp; If you do, you are
reducing your chances of getting a useful answer to your
question. <BR>
&nbsp; </LI>
<LI> <B>Do Not Cross-Post.</B>&nbsp; Posting a question to
more than one newsgroup is called &quot;cross-posting&quot;
and is strongly discouraged.&nbsp; Post your question to a
single newsgroup and wait a couple of days for an
answer.&nbsp; If several newsgroups seem to be related to
your question, pick one and post your question there
initially.&nbsp; If you are really uncertain which
newsgroup is appropriate for your question, you should
still post a single question to a single newsgroup, but you
can include a request to &quot;please direct me to the best
newsgroup for this question if this is not the right place
to ask&quot; in the message.&nbsp; Rest assured that
someone will point you to the &quot;right&quot; newsgroup
if you are in the wrong place. <BR>
&nbsp; </LI>
<LI> <B>Watch Your Replies For Cross-Posts.</B>&nbsp; If
someone has posted a message to multiple newsgroups and you
are replying, you can easily cross-post the reply.&nbsp;
Most newsgroup readers automatically post replies to all of
the groups where the original message was posted.&nbsp; So,
when you are replying to a message, look at the list of
destination newsgroups and, if there is more than one, pick
the best one and remove the others. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Be Courteous.</B>&nbsp; We all have opinions and
newsgroups generally encourage everyone to feel free to
express them.&nbsp; With rare exceptions, no one is trying
to start an argument.&nbsp; If you watch closely, you will
find that those that try to be disagreeable are generally
met with silence.&nbsp; If you think that someone is
deliberately being rude, I suggest that you simply not
respond.&nbsp; If you feel compelled to respond, send your
message directly to the e-mail address of the person
posting the message.<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI><B>Never Post Private E-Mail In A Newsgroup.</B>&nbsp;
E-mail messages are private communications.&nbsp; Posting
any portion of such a message to a newsgroup without the
sender's permission is simply not acceptable.&nbsp; (If you
really, really must post any portion of a private e-mail
message, either get the sender's permission or remove all
information that might indicate who sent you the message.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI><B>Nerver Post Copyrighted Code In A
Newsgroup.</B>&nbsp; The companies that host newsgroups
frequently include in their newsgroup posting guidelines
terms that assert that the company has rights to use
anything posted in the newsgroup.&nbsp; Borland is one of
these companies that claims rights to all information
posted.&nbsp; So, if you did not write the code, do not
post it to a newsgroup.<BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Quote Selectively.</B>&nbsp; When someone posts a
response to a message, it is common practice to quote, or
copy, parts of the the original message in the
response.&nbsp; This is such a common practice that most
newsgroup readers -- and, for that matter, e-mail readers
-- have an option to automatically copy the original
message into the response.&nbsp; This is fine, but delete
the parts of the original message that do not really relate
to your response.&nbsp; For example, if you posted a
question, someone posted a response with source code to
solve your problem, and you are responding with
&quot;thanks for the response -- you solved my
problem,&quot; delete the source code from the
response.&nbsp; On the other extreme, please <I>do</I>
quote relevant portions of the message to which you are
responding. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Think Globally #1.</B>&nbsp; Keep in mind that you
are speaking to the world.&nbsp; If English -- especially
American English -- is your native language, remember that
it is not the native tongue for the majority of the world.
&nbsp;Frankly, you are lucky that so much of the rest of
the world bothers to learn your language.&nbsp; Be
thoughtful and respectful -- make it easy for those for
which English is a second language to understand you.&nbsp;
Try to: <BR>
&nbsp;<OL>
<LI> <B>Avoid abbreviations.</B>&nbsp; You may know that
&quot;I would've&quot; means &quot;I would have,&quot; but
non-English readers may not.&nbsp; Do not make them get out
their English textbooks.&nbsp; On the other hand, use your
own judgment -- Kenneth de Camargo, a diligent Netizen of a
non-English native tongue and frequent participant in the
Borland newsgroups, tells me that &quot;would've&quot; was
too easy.&nbsp; I am not so sure, since he is most lucid
(usually &lt;g&gt;) and uses better English than most
Americans, at least in newsgroup posts. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Avoid slang.</B>&nbsp; &quot;Ain't&quot; is
probably not understood worldwide.&nbsp; Let us hope that
it will never be considered acceptable English anywhere on
this planet. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Avoid colloquialisms.</B>&nbsp; &quot;Raining cats
and dogs&quot; is probably as funny to a Russian speaker as
&quot;laying a pig on your stoop&quot; is incomprehensible
to you.&nbsp; Again, Dr. de Camargo informs me that this
admonishment may be overly enthusiastic -- and again, I am
not so sure.&nbsp; Use your best judgment. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Be gracious.</B>&nbsp; Never make fun or jokes of
another person's lack of mastery of English.&nbsp; I should
not have to say it, but it does happen.&nbsp; Personally, I
am convinced that those who do such things fall into one of
two classes: (1) Those who never attempted to learn another
language (and, therefore, do not understand the difficulty
of learning a second language) and (2) those who tried,
failed miserably, and resent those who did not fail equally
as miserably.&nbsp; Do not give others reason to classify
you this way. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Ask for further elaboration.</B>&nbsp; If you did
not understand the question, try to help out.&nbsp; For
example, ask &quot;Do you mean [this] or [that]?,&quot;
&quot;Shall I suppose you request help with [your best
guess]?,&quot; and the like.&nbsp; It is better, in my
humble opinion, to try too hard to help than to try too
little. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Keep cool.</B>&nbsp; Most often, offenses arise
from mere misunderstanding.&nbsp; Some expressions may have
connotations that were not originally intended when
translated literally from one language to other, and across
cultural borders.&nbsp; I have observed that non-English
speakers sometimes think that &quot;bummer&quot; is
vulgar.&nbsp; Although it is not vulgar to Americans, the
fact that they find it *possibly* vulgar should demonstrate
to you that cultural differences run deep.&nbsp; You should
first assume that anything potentially offensive was not
meant that way.&nbsp; Remember that what is sacred or
profane has a wide degree of cultural variation. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Post Code.</B>&nbsp; Remember that program source
code is probably the clearest way to answer a non-English
speaker's question. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Remember that you are from a very, very small
world.</B>&nbsp; After all, the &quot;World Series&quot; is
not considered a &quot;world event&quot; by anyone outside
of the US. &nbsp;This, of course, has little relevance to
the subject at hand -- but Ken made me say it. &lt;g&gt;

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">[ Thanks to Dr. Kenneth R. de
  Camargo for many insights on this topic. ] 
</P> <UL>
<LI> <B>Think Globally #2.</B>&nbsp; If English is not your
native language and you are not proficient (good) with
English, please understand that many English-speaking
people, and the vast majority of Americans, never learn
even one other language.&nbsp; So please treat us as idiots
and post a sample of any code that you are having trouble
with.&nbsp; It is better for you to post a long message
stating a question three different ways than to assume that
a single sentence will be understood. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>State Questions (And Answers) Clearly.</B>&nbsp;
The most common reason for not getting a correct answer is
not stating the question clearly.&nbsp; Where possible,
post a very brief source code example of your
problem.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are trying to
understand something that is new to you, ask for links to
sites and sources of information rather than asking a
specific question.&nbsp; You can always come back to the
newsgroup to ask specific questions after learning the
basics.&nbsp; For example, if you are starting to learn
about Rich Edit controls, post a request for information
sites before asking how to implement multi-level undo/redo
in Rich Edit 2.0 controls. <BR>
&nbsp;</LI>
<LI> <B>Say Thanks.</B>&nbsp; If you post a question and
someone posts a response that solves your problem, take the
time to post a brief message of thanks.&nbsp; On the other
hand, if the proposed solution did not work, keep in mind
that the responder was trying to help and ask yourself if
your question was clearly stated.&nbsp; Post a response
saying thanks anyway and, if appropriate, explain your
problem again.&nbsp; This lets both the person responding
and anyone else following the thread (an original post and
all of the related replies) know that the response did --
or did not -- solve your problem. <BR>
