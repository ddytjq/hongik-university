      <P><I>-- November 25 and 26th, Sebring Florida, Central Florida
      Region SCCA regional race</I></P>

      <P>After doing years and years of high performance driving and
      instructing, I decided to take the new 2001 Corvette Z06 racing.
      Roll cage, fire extinguisher, seat, racing harness, tires and
      brakes are about all the modifications you can make to run the
      new Corvettes in SCCA class T1. After arriving on Friday morning
      for a test day trying out different brakes and tires, it was
      time for the Saturday morning qualifying. Due to a fairly severe
      rain on Friday night, the track was still a bit damp for the
      qualifying. Quite frankly, there were only 2 T1 cars in the field
      of T2, ITS, ITGT, ITA, SSP and SSA cars so I should have been
      quickest and was by over a second on the damp track, setting
      a time of 2:43.4. The rain on the plains of Sebring does not
      drain which makes fast driving a real pain! We were the 6th run
      group and didn&#146;t actually start the race until almost 5pm
      on Saturday afternoon. I started from the pole of a field of
      47 cars on the right side to prepare for turn 10 (yes 10, not
      1 due to the SCCA using the starting line in front of their timing
      and scoring trailer between 7 and 8). Once the green flag dropped,
      the 385 hp LS-6 spun up quickly from 2nd gear and then shifting
      to 3d as I kept the lead into 10. The ITGT (basically ITE) Camaro
      of Lee Arnold close behind. He stayed fairly close through the
      next few turns until the top end speed of the new Z pulled away
      down the back straight between turns 16 and 17. My speedo (using
      the 17 in tires) hit around 140 mph or so. Turns 17 and 18 are
      very tricky as there are about as many lines through the corner
      as there are cars on track and for the race I would downshift
      from 4th to 3rd after braking. I found out on Sunday that it&#146;s
      probably better to stay in 4th and carry speed around the corner.
      Once back around to Turn 1, the braking zone is very rough as
      is the corner itself. It&#146;s a blind, decreasing radius corner
      and it&#146;s necessary to get as close to the wall on the left
      as possible to have good exit speed and not run out of room at
      the exit. Several cars didn&#146;t get this right and ended up
      in the tire wall however. Do not turn in early here. Turns 4
      and 5 were still very slick and push is almost always a problem
      on the entrance, then power-on oversteer once you try to come
      out of there.</P>

      <P><BR>
      Heading down to the old hairpin, Sebring has changed the track.
      They have shortcut the hairpin and put a &quot;safety pin&quot;
      (their words, not mine). The turn is about as tight but the terminal
      speed just before braking is not as much and it does give a safety
      cushion in case you can&#146;t make the turn; simply straight
      line your braking zone and go all the way down to the hair pin
      and come back up. Top speed just before braking was around 120
      or so. Get the entrance to 7 (safety pin) right because it&#146;s
      leading to the front straight and a great passing zone (in the
      dry) into 10 again. After the first lap, I had about a 1-second
      lead on Lee and slowly stretched that over the next few laps.
      Once he realized he could not catch me and was under no real
      pressure himself, he backed off the pace&#133;as did I. We both
      set our fastest laps on the second lap of the race and then went
      into somewhat of a cruise mode for the rest of the race. His
      fastest lap was a 2:34.69, which was a new track record or his
      class. My fastest was a 2:33.68, which also was a new track record,
      despite a &quot;green track&quot; due to all the rain. I won
      the race by a margin of nearly 24 seconds!</P>

      <P>Sunday&#146;s rains were in the morning, but I did manage
      to get a 10-minute test session in the morning. On this session,
      I went 4 seconds faster than my new track record! I&#146;m also
      sure there&#146;s another 2 seconds to be had there with new
      tires, better brakes and lots of practice. On the last lap of
      the test session on Sunday the skies opened up and it rained
      the rest of the day. It actually started to dry a bit just before
      my afternoon race so I still had on those old Kumho tires (with
      no tread). As I was sitting on the grid with about 10 minutes
      before we rolled out, the skies opened up again. I somehow managed
      5th and kept the car on track (and undented) for the 30 minute
      experience. After the first 3 laps, I decided to do a bit of
      car testing and turned the active handling and traction control
      back on to see how it would do. Overall, it was a bit slower
      lap time wise than with it off and me controlling it, but it
      sure was a nice safety net due to the horrible conditions. I&#146;d
      like to have seen what would have happened had I put on the full-tread,
      stock street tires I had in the trailer! Oh well&#133; I had
      no error messages and the system definitely got a great workout.
      I highly recommend the new Corvette Z06!</P>

      <P>The track itself is very bumpy which makes threshold braking
      an adventure and snap oversteer a looming possibility at every
      corner, especially through 1. Turns 4 and 5 are absolutely diabolical
      in the rain. The car simply will not turn unless you have some
      spongy rain tires and a front drive car. Lots of standing water
      at 10 makes passing there nearly impossible, so in a driving
      rain, I think it&#146;s probably better to start on the LEFT
      at the beginning of a race. It&#146;s much easier to maintain
      your momentum around the outside than try to get turned and power
      out.</P>
