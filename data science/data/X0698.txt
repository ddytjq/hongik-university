<p class=black>It's time to re-visit and bring some more product reviews to our visitors. We are adding several more products to this review. We are trying to keep
you guys and gals up to date on what is available these days. I am sure there will always be some new "contraption" to try to achieve gains
when it comes to increasing one's vertical leap. Plyometrics, box jumps, jumping rope, calf raises, bounding, running, weight training. All
are valid. Which is best? I have yet to come to that conclusion. One last note, don't let cost stand in your way. Some of these products are incredible.
Enjoy the article.</p>

<p class="black">Strength Systems, Inc. created the concept of frontal platform shoes. When you visit their website you are confronted with over
100 products to choose from. They have provided different categories to choose from to make your search easier and more timely. I am not going to
review their website. But, I have to say that Strength Systems definitely offers the athlete many proven products. They have been gracious enough
to send PowerBasketball one of their newest products, their Strength® Weighted Vest and Shorts. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p class="black">Personally, I like this idea. Zip up the vest, pull the shorts on, add the provided weights, put them in. Go workout, run, whatever. I would
think the purpose of this "suit" is that you don't necessarilly need to change your workout to see greater gains. The added weight, of which you
can purchase additional units when you are ready, is placed strategically without becoming clunky. The "suit" is my New Year's resolution. I plan to get
back into shape. I have put on a couple of pounds over the past year. My morning run has gotten boring, this ought to spruce up my workout.
I can't wait to get started. Although, I better take my own advice and go slow and not try it all the first day. I will definitely keep everyone posted on my progress.

<p class="black">Yeah, I know, we have reviewed SkyFlex and their strength shoes. But this product is different. First, rather than lacing up new shoes
you strap the jumpsoles to the shoes you already have. Second, there is a hole on the bottom of the shoe that you place this little plug, the proprioceptor,
into. Whoa! No, I mean Wow! Unbelievable, jumpsoles taken to the next level. Our current test athlete complained that this may be the hardest workout
he has ever done. My legs are like "jello" after the workout was his comment I believe. This kid is good, real good. A high school senior and varsity football
starter, you would have to assume he is in shape. Standing at a "massive" 5'9" and weighing in at an incredible 165 lbs. This kid is a "monster". Well, he
was the leading tackler on the football team this year, averaging over 10 tackles per game. Why would this kid need to use JumpUSA's proprioceptor
system you ask? He wants to increase his foot speed and agility. We will be getting some preliminary results back after the first of the year
regarding Andrew's gains. </p>

This is a unique product. Yeah, you might look a little silly wearing this, but the science of the product is there. The workout and accompanying
video featuring Don Beebe are good. The video runs through Don Beebe's workout rather quickly and the section using the Speed Trainer is minimal.
However, I am here to tell you the product lives up to its claims. Put on some sweats over the top of the Speed Trainers and watch the gains.
<br><br>One of our athletes is giving them a try at this time. Once, we get some results back we can have some documented proof of the validity of this
product. I gave them a try for a week. I noticed a difference. Watch for more results.

<p class="black">Well, it's been a long time coming. The text may not seem like much. But many hours have gone into reviewing these products. From athletes
building the necessary boxes for the STS Strength of Jumping, to stop watch timing with the SkyFlex training shoes. I don't want to think
how many hours I have personally spent. However, here are some results for you to scan. I have added images and links to the individual products.
<br><br> Don't ask me to single out one program or the other. They all work great. They each have their own benefit. They are not alike except
for the results they boast. So, that means there are plenty of exercises to help improve your vertical leap. Each product comes complete with a workout
designed especially for themselves. They have no overlapping exercises. The advantage to this article. I am not quite sure. Maybe cost?
Some athletes have a hard time investing in their future. The most expensive program of the four, the SkyFlex plyometric shoes,
is probably the most exhausting workout. Maybe consider the workout? I think the important point is that everyone is looking for a
definitive answer to jumping higher. <strong>I am here to tell you, "There is not just ONE solution!."</strong> Good luck and enjoy the article.
<br><br>PowerBasketball would like to thank each of the companies for allowing us the opportunity to review their products. If you have any knowledge of any jump programs
and would like PowerBasketball to review them, <a href=":mailto:dpower@ircc.net"> please contact me. </a></p>

<p class="black">At one time in our lives, as athletes, many of us have thought about purchasing those expensive "plyo shoes". You know the ones. Those
funny looking shoes that make your heels come off the ground forcing to use your calves more than you ever dreamed. Well, I would like to say
that I had always been concerned about these shoes. It just did not seem like such a great concept. The idea of forcing one's heels up and
and throwing your body off balance. It's like learning to walk all over again.</p>
<p class="black">Well, I was wrong. Our test athlete did find it a bit difficult adjusting to the shoes, for the first 10 minutes. But these shoes really do work.
I should say I was pleasantly surprised. SkyFlex sent us their shoes along with their training program, a rigid yet fair workout. Our test athlete selected the horizontal
approach, rather than the traditional "vertical" program that most are after. The training program tested him on his leg strength as well as
his endurance. We followed the correct steps and tested him before we started. We used a 50 yard run rather than a 40 yard as suggested.
Our course is designed in 75 foot intervals. We ran him through a series of sprints and his average worked out to a 7.16 after 8 passes.
Next up, the dreaded "vertical leap". Again we took an average of 8 jumps and the average was 14 inches. Our athlete stands at 5'2"
with his shoes on, weighs in at 88 lbs., and is twelve years old. This kid stays in shape playing competitively ten months a year. As a point guard, his job to
get up and down the floor is most important. The reason for selecting the horizontal workout.</p>
<p class="black">The first week of training has been completed . First, the sprints. Eight sprints later his average
was down to 6.97. The vertical leap had also increased, to fifteen inches. Not bad. Now it's up to the athlete to continue in his efforts
to improve. As this athlete continues his progress, we will continue to add to this review. Keep up with us.</p>

<p class="black">Now this contraption is unique. The founder contacted me about testing his product and I accepted after talking to him
about his product. A pleasant experience to start. The next step was to put the product to the test. I was told I would be impressed.
I went back to the website and noticed some research on the calf isolator. If this product review sounds like you, you should definitely read the research.</p>
<p class=black>I know plenty of athletes that are constantly trying to improve themselves. Some of them want to jump higher, others shoot better,
and still others just want to improve their mental toughness for the game of basketball. The selected athlete stands at just under six foot tall
and weighs in at 185 lbs. He will be turning thirteen this fall. This kid is big. His goal, "Coach, I want to grab the rim". I told him
about the Sky-King calf isolator. He responded with an ecstatic, "bring it on coach".</p>
<p class=black>He has been working out diligently over the summer months. As I reflect back on his training, I realize the kind of enthusiasm
he still has for this. He started out playing around on an 8' goal height, no problem. We moved it up six inches, piece of cake. Six inches
more brought the rim up to 9'. He jumped up, his fingertips barely stroked the bottom of the rim. He could not believe it. Come on coach
let me try it again. He did, the same result. He just could not do it. This is where the Sky-King calf isolator comes in. We walked inside
and I got him to adjust the isolator to fit. The workout was simple enough. Just stretch as far as you can while you are using the "machine"
properly. He was ready after showing him the proper form and amount of sets and repetitions. A half hour later, he was out the door walking
home, very slowly. The isolator had taken its toll. His muscles were sore. I told him that was a good sign.</p>
<p class=black>Six weeks had passed. He was continuing to work out every other day, Monday-Wednesday-Friday, with the weekends off. A few
younger athletes had been shooting that afternoon so we had lowered the basket to 8 feet. Some of the "bigger" guys wanted to play so I
offered to raise the hoop. "Yeah, coach hurry up we want to play some 3-on-3.", they chanted. I did my duty and raised the hoop. The game
was getting pretty intense with big guys shoving each other all over the court. He broke free about the free throw line went up and dunked the
ball. I could not believe it. Had he really increased that dramatically? I asked him to do it again. The same result. He nearly pulled
the whole goal down with a monster windmill dunk ala "the Diesel", Shaquille O'neal. I knew it was to good to be true when my point guard
pointed out that the goal was only set at 9'6". My center was a bit disappointed when he found this out. So, I raised the hoop up to 10'.
He said he wanted to try again. He missed the rim by the length of his long fingers. He has promised me a great Christmas present, "Watch me,
coach, I am going to dunk it!". We will have to wait and see.</p>

<p class="black">The jump program that started this whole article. How would it stack up against the more expensive machines? You can read
our original review, <a href="airalert.html"> check it out.</a> the bottom line, as far as I am concerned, was does the program compare.
I would have to say, Yes. I have had alot of people contact me over the past year and a half about this program. Questions about tendinitis,
does it really work?, what are the exercises?, just to name a few. I assume that tendinitis is a possibility when you perform any type of
workout to increase your vertical leap. I don't want to steer people the wrong way. The athletes that I originally tested have not suffered
from any type of injury directly related to the Air Alert program. Actually, the fifteen year old from my original review is now dunking the ball.
Not bad, for a sophomore in high school standing 5'11". I am not trying to "hawk" one product and I sure don't get a cut from TMT Sports.
What can I say? Air Alert does work.<br><br>

<p class="black">Our original review of the Science of Jumping was probably a bit sketchy. We had an athlete back out on us and were
searching for someone. A junior on our school's varsity boy's basketball team said he was interested. He and his father proceeded to
watch the tape intent on the purpose of elevating him to new heights. They followed through and built the plyo boxes to the correct
dimensions. He was a bit out of shape and was hitting the weight room for upper body strength three times a week and on the off days was
following the program. His jumping ability was improving. Now, this may not sound like much. But, when a kid is 6'3" they should be able to
dunk. Wouldn't you think? Not this guy. A bit overweight, maybe twenty pounds for his size. Something was holding him back. It sure was not his
will. His goal was to improve his vertical leap over the summer. Well, it worked. I am hoping to watch this kid throw down a wicked two handed
dunk this season!
