				<P align=justify>Well-intentioned Canadians seem to have two reactions to thorny problems: throw money at them or attack them with some sort of a new law. </P>
<P align=justify>New laws and tax dollars are widely seen as the solutions to all of what ails this world. Few governments are willing to throw tax money at old problems these days, but some seem willing to cough up a new law at the drop of a hat - and a new law with Criminal Code penalties and teeth. That's how come we've got a totally ineffective national firearms registry that has so far cost us $700 million and solves no problems. </P>
<P align=justify>New laws are often not what they seem to be. Particularly in Canada, a new law no matter what its intent, is simply a pile of words on paper until it is interpreted by the courts. Bear that in mind for a bit while we look at the sticky question of cruelty to animals. </P>
<P align=justify>Is there a citizen alive who would stand up and object to severe punishment for those who willingly abuse animals? Think back a bit to some infamous cases. How about the puppy dragged to its death behind a pickup truck? Do you like the two jerks who videotaped themselves skinning cats alive, ostensibly for an "art project"? Or how about the starved and diseased dogs, seized over the past year from southern Ontario puppy mills? </P>
<P align=justify>Sections of the Criminal Code of Canada dealing with cruelty to animals are more than a century old and lack substantial penalties. The head cat-torturer, for example, was sentenced to 90 days in jail to be served on weekends. Maximum fines for cruelty to animals are six years in jail and a fine of $2,000. The fines, in particular, are simply a licence fee for those who want to mass produce puppies for gullible consumers. </P>
<P align=justify>Let's make some changes to the law to put some more teeth into its animal cruelty sections, say humane societies, animal welfare groups, animal rights groups and sane citizens. As Canadians we want to put an end to some of this wanton abuse. </P>
<P align=justify>That seemed to be everybody's intent, back in the late 1990s when the process got started. </P>
<P align=justify>Unfortunately, though, the animal rights people highjacked the agenda. Unable to get at agriculture, medical research, hunting and fishing...anything that makes use of animals, legitimately and legally, animal rights extremists engineered a backdoor approach. </P>
<P align=justify>The result was a badly flawed Bill C-17, which could have been used to restrict all sorts of legitimate animal uses in agriculture, research, hunting and fishing. </P>
<P align=justify>That's because of the gap between the words on paper and the reality of a new law as interpreted by the courts. Anglers, hunters, trappers, farmers and researchers predicted Bill C-17 was a law that could be interpreted to throttle all sorts of legitimate uses of animals and normal farm practices. </P>
<P align=justify>The resulting outcry stalled the bill, which died on the order paper. </P>
<P align=justify>Here's what happened next, according to Liz White, of Animal Alliance fame in a recent fund-raising letter, aimed at drawing dollars to the Alliance's political war chest:<BR><BR>"It started in the last federal election," she wrote. "Because of a commitment made by Minister of Justice Anne McLellan in the House of Commons, Environment Voters (identified by White as the political arm of the Animal Alliance) campaigned for her re-election. Under attack by hunters and gun owners and a cabal of extremist right wing groups, Ms. MeLellan was in a losing campaign. Environment Voters stepped in and championed her election. We ran the better campaign. Ms. McLellan won by 700 votes." </P>
<P align=justify>C-17 came back as Bill C-15B. Same sorts of flaws. No arguments about its intent, but serious doubts about how courts could be led to interpret it. Is it cruel to castrate bulls to make beef? Is de-horning cattle cruel. Is fishing a form of torture. Is taking a dog hunting abuse of dog and game? Should my dog and cat be forced onto vegetarian diets, or is that cruel? </P>
<P align=justify>Bill C-15B is now under further attack by a rural caucus of Liberal backbench MPs, which sees the dangers in the way the law could be interpreted and reads it as urban interests being thrust on rural Canada. </P>
<P align=justify>Liz White, however, predicts her day will be won and Bill C-15B will become the law of the land. Her job then will be to convince the courts that it should be interpreted from an animal rights perspective. </P>
<P align=justify>"Getting our politicians to pass good animal protection laws is about reward and punishment," she wrote to her supporters, "- rewarding them for doing a good job and punishing them for doing a poor one." </P>
<P align=justify>Speaking of election campaigns, she noted: "Win or lose, what's important is that you and I once again show the Liberal Party and all other parties that - unlike in the past - there are more votes in compassion than in cruelty. </P>
<P align=justify>"For the sake of the animals who touch our hearts, I pray that with these examples, I've convinced you that renewing your support for Animal Alliance will truly help the animals, including those who share your caring home." </P>
<P align=justify>Liz White, Animal Alliance, Environment Voters and all the other hard-core animal rights activists out there have only one agenda and that is to halt all use of animals, to eventually give them status equal to humans under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They won't stop until a rabbit, a deer and a rat have the same rights as my children and grandchildren. </P>
<P align=justify>Think I'm kidding? </P>
<P align=justify>Here's a May 18, 2002, despatch from the pages of the respected British newspaper, The Guardian. </P>
<P align=justify>Datelined Berlin, it reads: "Germany became the first country in the European Union to grant constitutional rights to its animals yesterday (May 17)." </P>
<P align=justify>By inserting three words "und die Tiere (and the animals) into the highest law of the land, Germany's politicians decreed that the state should protect "the natural foundations of life" for animals as well as humans. </P>
<P align=justify>"From now on," the Guardian says, "the German federal constitutional court will have to weigh animal rights against such factors as society's requirement for scientific research and the right to freedom of religion. This could translate into tighter restrictions on the use of animals for testing cosmetics or non-prescription drugs. It also appeared to put a question mark over a recent decision to allow butchers to practice ritual Muslim slaughter of animals." </P>
<P align=justify>Germany's Agriculture Minister says the vote does not give animals equal rights with humans. Wonder what the German courts will decide about that when the new status of rats and deer is tested in the law? </P>
<P align=justify>Why do I worry so much about new laws? </P>
<P align=justify>How would you feel about a Canada where the rights of your children were exactly the same as the rights of your pets </P>
<P align=justify>Think about it carefully before you offer any support to an animal rights organization. Investigate before you donate. </P>This article appeared in <A href="http://www.canada.com/Peterborough/" target=_blank>The Peterborough Examiner</A> on Sunday May 26, 2002.
