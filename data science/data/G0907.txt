    <P>The Leonid meteor shower takes place every year around November
    17 when Earth passes close to the orbit of comet Tempel-Tuttle.
    Usually not much happens. The Earth plows through a diffuse cloud
    of old comet dust that shares Tempel-Tuttle's orbit, and the
    debris burns up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere. A typical Leonid
    meteor shower consists of a meager 10 to 20 shooting stars per
    hour. </P>

    <P>
If this were always the case, the Leonids would
    be known to a small number of meteor enthusiasts only. Instead
    they are famous. At roughly 33 year intervals the Leonid meteor
    shower can blossom into what astronomers call a meteor &quot;storm,&quot;
    when <I>hundreds of thousands</I> of shooting stars per hour
    rain down from the sky. </P>

    <P>Leonid storms occur at intervals separated by multiples of
    33 years, the period of comet Tempel-Tuttle's orbit around the
    sun. Whenever the comet swings through the inner solar system
    it brings a dense cloud of debris with it, so that for 3 or 4
    years after its passage the Leonids can be very active. Curiously,
    there isn't a full-fledged storm every time Tempel-Tuttle passes
    by.</P>

    <P>
Sometimes there's simply a stronger-than-average shower, never
    quite rising to the level of a storm, and sometimes nothing much
    at all happens to mark the comet's passage. This capricious behavior
    makes predicting Leonid meteor storms a bit tricky. </P>

The last great Leonid meteor storm was in 1966. It was, predictably,
    somewhat unexpected. The comet had passed by Earth's orbit in
    1965, so astronomers were aware that something might happen.
    But, judging by the paucity of the 1899 and 1932 showers, it
    was widely thought that the orbit of the debris stream had been
    deflected so much by gravitational encounters with other planets (mainly Jupiter)
  that a close encounter with Earth's orbit was no longer
    possible. The best predictions suggested a strong shower over
    western Europe with 100 or so meteors per hour. </P>

    <P>Instead, there was an stunning display of shooting stars over
    western North America. This recollection by James Young at JPL's
    Table Mountain Observatory in California gives a sense of what
    the storm was like:</P>

      <P><I>&quot;This very noteworthy [1966] meteor shower was nearly
      missed altogether... There were 2-5 meteors seen every second
      as we scrambled to set up the only two cameras we had, as no
      real preparations had been made for any observations or photography.
      The shower was expected to occur over the European continent.
<BR>
<BR>
      The shower peaked around 4 a.m., with some 50 meteors falling
      per second. We all felt like we needed to put on 'hard hats'!
      The sky was absolutely full of meteors...a sight never imagined
      ... and never seen since! To further understand the sheer intensity
      of this event, we blinked our eyes open for the same time we
      normally blink them closed, and saw the entire sky full of streaks
      ... everywhere!&quot;</I></P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P>The 1966 return of the Leonids was one of the greatest displays
    in history, with a maximum rate of 2400 meteors per minute or
    144,000 per hour. </P>

Tempel-Tuttle visited the inner solar system most recently
    in late 1997 and early 1998. The subsequent Leonids display,
    in Nov. 1998, was marvelous as observers all over the world were
    treated to a <a href="ast27nov98_1.htm">dazzling display of fireballs</a> (shooting stars with <a href="http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/MAG.HTML">magnitudes</a> brighter than -3). Nevertheless, the
    1998 Leonids were a shower, not a storm. The maximum rate of
    meteors last year was about 250 per hour. Scientists have learned
    that if Earth crosses the orbit of Tempel-Tuttle <I>too soon</I>
    after the comets passage, then there is no storm, just a strong
    shower. Apparently that's what happened in 1998. In recent history
    no Leonid storm has ever occurred less than 300 days after Tempel-Tuttle
    passed by Earth's orbit. In 1998, Earth followed the comet to
    the orbit-crossing point by only 257 days [<A HREF="http://www.skypub.com/sights/meteors/leonids/9904awaitstorm.html">ref</A>].

    Arlt of the <A HREF="http://www.imo.net/">International Meteor
    Organization</A> noted that while the maximum activity came early,
    there was a secondary maximum when the Earth passed the comet's
    orbit (see left). This pattern is similar to that observed in
    1965, the year that preceded the great Leonids storm of 1966.

      to show a similar shape of activity as in 1966. The actual maximum

    <P>Joe Rao, a Leonids expert who lectures at New York's Hayden

      if this year's Leonids are richer in number, observers should
      not expect the same high proportion of fireballs that were seen
      in 1998. Instead, a more even mix of bright and faint meteors
      is likely. </I>[<A HREF="http://www.skypub.com/sights/meteors/leonids/9904awaitstorm.html">ref</A>]</P>

Rao bases his argument on historical precedent and the Earth-comet
    geometry. During the seven most recent Leonid storms when Earth
    crossed Tempel-Tuttle's orbit soon after the comet, the average
    distance between the comet and Earth was 0.0068 <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980122b.html">astronomical
    unit</a>. The average number of days between the 
comet's passage and the Earth's arrival
at the plane of the comet's orbit was 602.8 days. With the 1999 values of 0.0080 a.u.
    and 622.5 days, Rao says we ought to be in a prime position to
    see significant, if not storm-level, activity. </P>

    <P>Rao is also a meteorologist for News 12 Westchester, which
    seems a suitable occupation for predicting meteor showers. </P>

    <P>
In 1999, the
                   Earth will pass nearly three times 
as far from the comet's orbital path as it did in 1966 and
                   more than six times further than it did during 
the great storm of 1833. 
If the peak of the
Leonids arrives exactly when the Earth passes 
through the comet's orbital plane, Donald Yeomans of JPL
                   
            gives 01:48 UT on November 18, 1999 as the most likely time
for the 1999 maximum  [<A HREF="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/leonids.html">ref</A>].
That
    would make Europe and North Africa the best places to watch the
    show. However, Leonid meteor showers frequently arrive much earlier
    or later than predicted, so any place on the globe could be favored.

    <H2>A blast from the past reveals the future</H2>

    <P>The spectacular display of fireballs in 1998 was a treat for
    observers, but it posed some interesting questions for astronomers.
<BR>
<BR>
    According to David Asher of the Armagh Observatory and his colleagues,
    the intensity and duration of this exceptional event indicated
    that the Earth must have passed through an extremely dense, narrow
    stream of large dust grains and particles. The timing implied
    that these debris particles occupied an orbit somewhat different
    from the main stream, and that they left the comet's nucleus
    many hundreds of years ago. But in that case, how did the stream
    has hold together so tightly for so long? <BR>
<BR>
    
    To solve the problem, Dr David Asher and his co-workers calculated
    the motion of large dust grains ejected from comet Tempel-Tuttle
    at each of the last 42 occasions when it made its closest approach
    to the Sun. They checked to see whether any of the particles
    could explain the fireballs seen in 1998, and identified September
    1333 as the time when most of the observed particles must have
    been released. <BR>
<BR>
   <IMG SRC="../../images/leonids/leonid4_sm.gif" BORDER="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"

     SIZE="-1" FACE="arial,helvetica">: A short video segment showing
    a Leonid fireball as seen from the stratosphere. It was recorded
    by a digital video camera carried aloft by a NASA weather balloon
    on Nov. 17, 1998. More images and video may be
seen at <a href="http://www.leonidslive.com">LeonidsLive.com</a>. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
 The particles were kept in a tight stream by a process known
    as &quot;gravitational resonance.&quot; A similar phenomenon
    gives rise to the fine structure seen in Saturn's rings. In
    this case, grains ejected from the comet in 1333 were kept in
    step by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Instead of spreading
    around the whole orbit, they were nudged by periodic "kicks" from
    Jupiter's gravity into a rather short arc of large particles,
    distinct from the 'normal' stream of small particles ahead of
    and behind the comet. Their calculations showed that in November
    1998 most of the resonant arcs missed the Earth by a wide margin,
    but the arc of particles released in 1333 cut right through the
    Earth's orbit, and the calculated time for when this happened
    matched the observed fireball maximum to the hour. <BR>
<BR>
    Armagh and co-workers are not expecting a repeat performance
    of bright fireballs in November in 1999. All the resonant strands
    in the meteoroid stream will be well past Earth in space. However,
    a strong 'normal' display is likely, peaking at about 2 a.m.
    on November 18th, due to meteoroids ejected from Comet Tempel-Tuttle
    in the years 1866, 1899 and 1932, which have not yet had time
    to disperse around the comet's orbit. <BR>
<BR>
    Rob McNaught of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics
    at the Australian National University and colleagues have
 examined the motions of Tempel-Tuttle
    debris particles ejected from the comet within the last 200
years. Their calculations predict that the maximum hourly rate of
    meteors in 1999 will be 1000 to 1500 per hour -- not exactly
    a major storm, but still a remarkable display -- and that the
    best years to observe could be in the next millennium when hourly
    rates might reach 10,000 - 35,000 in 2001 and 25,000 in 2002.
These conclusions differ from most other 
recent studies which predict greatest
activity during the years 1998 - 2000, but the Leonids do not always
adhere to conventional wisdom.
