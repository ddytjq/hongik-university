<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Is space curved? 
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The three well known <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Friedmann.html">
Friedmann</a> models provide <em>one way</em> to answer the  question about
curvature<strong>:</strong> whether space in the universe is curved or not
depends on the density (so much matter per unit volume).   If the density
is <em>equal to</em> a certain <strong>critical value</strong> - equivalent
to one or two hydrogen atoms per cubic meter - there is no curvature<strong>
:</strong> the three spatial dimensions we clearly recognize remain orthogonal
at all eras<strong>;</strong> this is the Euclidean "flat" model. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Should the density be <em>less than</em> critical density, the universe
is "open" and its space is negatively curved.    A slice of this model is
saddle-shaped, and the sum of the three angles of a triangle on this surface
is a little <em>less than</em> 180&ordm; .   On the other hand, if the density
is <em>greater than</em> the critical value, the universe is "closed" and
its space is positively curved.    A comparable slice resembles the surface
of an expanding sphere, and the sum of three angles of a triangle here is
a little <em>greater than</em> 180&ordm;. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The three Friedmann models have enormous appeal because they're so
easy to understand.  They also predict the ultimate fate of the universe<strong>:</strong> it will expand forever only if the density is less than or equal
to the critical value.   Otherwise the days of an  expanding universe are
numbered  because this high density model will expand only to certain  maximum
size and then contract into a "big crunch" ("big bang" in reverse) at some
future date  at least tens of billions of years from today. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Until recently, cosmology has been described as the quest for two
numbers: (1) Hubble's constant, which measures the rate of expansion of the
universe, and (2) the deceleration parameter which indicates how fast the
rate of expansion is slowing down.   To this long revered pair (whose determination
was considered the cosmic "holy grail"), a search for a <em>third</em> number
is currently underway<strong>:</strong> a cosmological constant which causes
    <em>acceleration</em> in the rate of expansion. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The "age" of the universe is the length of time it has been expanding
from the original singularity - the collapsed dimensionless state from which
everything started to expand - and the best guess is that the universe has
been expanding for something like 13 to 14 billion years, and not too likely
to go beyond a billion years in either direction from this rather well defined
range.   Confining the research to the determination of just the first two
numbers is not sufficient to describe the universe as we see it<strong>;</strong>
 the most reasonable estimates of Hubble's constant and the deceleration
parameter make the universe too young. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To increase the
age of the universe to a comfort level more consistent with current observations, the notion that there <em>must</em> be a parameter which offsets the deceleration due to gravity has been recently recycled.   (Einstein originated the idea of a "cosmological constant" - that is, a force opposed to gravity - early in the twentieth century, and then discarded it.)   
    </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>However, neither <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Einstein.html">
Albert Einstein's</a> theory of relativity nor <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hubble.html">
Edwin Hubble's</a> expanding universe impose any restrictions on the topology
(structure) of the universe.   Although the universe is almost always depicted
as an expanding sphere - a "slice" of which can have negative, zero, or positive
curvature - that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it is.   And even though
Friedmann's three mutually exclusive varieties have the most popularity,
other models are seriously considered in which the character of space differs
markedly from the Friedmann models. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If you check some of the sites in the <a href="links.html">Collection
of Links</a> file, you'll get the flavor of some of the intriguing alternate
models and realize that there have been knowledgeable and sophisticated "noncomformists"
all along. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In the following essays, I'm gong to concentrate exclusively on the model which I think is most likely to replace the Friedmann models, if they ever <em>are</em> replaced.   It's one you've probably heard mentioned several
times before<strong>:</strong> it's that "finite but unbounded universe"
which, like your typical mother-in-law, keeps hanging around. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The history of this long suspected model is rather interesting.   Among the solutions of Einstein's general theory of theory was one which, in its simplest terms, supposed that a spherical surface was "embedded" in higher dimensional space.   Alexandr Friedmann discovered this solution first, and it was rediscovered a few years later by two other mathematicians, Robertson and Walker.   Sometimes their joint solution is called the "Robertson-Walker (RW) metric"; at other times all three names are attached and it's referred as the "Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric".    
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But the RW (or FRW) metric is simply the cosmological equivalent of what is known in topology as "Riemannian space".   The most unusual aspect of this model - whatever name you call it - is that it incorporates a fourth spatial
dimension which, while not having the same character as the first three spatial
dimensions, exists in a way which causes the three obvious spatial dimensions
to become globally curved. 
    </p>

    <blockquote> <font color="red">[From time to time I'll insert commments

to the "mainstream" or an addition to older text.   Here is an example of the typical  nomenclature used in modern cosmology:  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26A...364..894L&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=3bf93a82e127347">

In other words, you're going to find out how the universe could <em>start off</em> as a "closed cosmic hypersphere" (with Riemannian or RW or FRW space) and <em>stay</em> that way.
<p>
Since the derivation of this model is through topology, I generally prefer the mathematical lingo - such as "Riemannian hypersphere" or "Riemannian space" - rather than the RW or FRW metric, more commonly used in cosmology.] </font> </blockquote>
  <a name="limits"> </a>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To repeat, a fourth spatial dimension <strong>cannot</strong>
 have the same character as the  first three spatial dimensions or our physical
world would not behave the way it does.    Gravity and light intensity, which
vary as the <em>inverse square</em> of the distance in  three-dimensional
(3D) space, will change as the <em>inverse cube</em> of the distance in  four-dimensional
(4D) space if the fourth spatial dimension behaves <em>exactly</em> like
the  first three. 
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Nothing like this has been observed, and so we can safely assume
that a fourth  spatial dimension does <em>not</em> have a character comparable
to the (x,y,z) dimensions with  which we're familiar.  </p>

      <p> </p>
<blockquote>      
<ol>
 <strong>
        <li> A very small fourth spatial dimension.</strong> 
          <p>  While the foundations for non-Euclidean geometry were laid by several excellent mathematicians in the 19th century - such as <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Gauss.html">Gauss</a>, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Bolyai.html">Bolyai</a>, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Riemann.html">Riemann</a>, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Lobachevsky.html">Lobachevsky</a>, and <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Clifford.html">Clifford</a>  -  the possibility of extra-dimensional space received the largest impetus in the early 20th century through a brilliant insight of an unknown Prussian mathematician named <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kaluza.html">Theodor Kaluza</a>.   In 1919 Kaluza wrote a letter to Albert Einstein postulating that, should there be a fourth spatial dimension, then Einstein's theory of gravity and Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic radiation could be combined.   (The Kaluza link above mentions this as the <em>fifth</em> dimension, after three spatial dimensions and one time dimension.   Today Kaluza's idea is usually referred to as the fourth <em>spatial</em> dimension.)
</p>
          <p> It took Einstein until 1921 before he replied to Kaluza's remarkable
suggestion with a belated agreement.     </p>
          <p> But if there <em>was</em> a fourth spatial dimension, why didn't
we <em>notice</em> it? </p>
          <p> A Swedish mathematician, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Klein_Oskar.html">
Oskar Klein</a> had also been thinking independently about a fourth spatial
dimension during the 1920s.   When he became aware of Kaluza's little known
work on the same topic, Klein proposed a solution still accepted in modern
physics<strong>:</strong> a fourth spatial dimension <em>did</em> exist,
but in packets of space too small for us to detect.   A  "compactified" unit
of such space is usually called the "<a href="http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/projects.old/classes/ma8/papers/dstanke/Project/Superstrings.html">
Kaluza-Klein bottle</a>", and it is the basis for today's string theory in
physics.   (The linked file was created by Dr. David Stanke while he was
at Brown University.) </p>
          <p> Today many physicists believe that the Kaluza-Klein bottle
contains more dimensions than just the fourth one<strong>;</strong> usually
ten spatial dimensions are assumed, sometimes even twenty six! </p>
          <p>    
        </li>
<br>
<strong>
        <li> A very large fourth spatial dimension.</strong> 
          <p> An alternative mode for a fourth spatial dimension, much less
emphasized by the physicists on the string theory bandwagon, is described
in a typical undergraduate topology course.   To understand its nature in
topology, consider a spherical surface<strong>:</strong> although its curved
spherical surface always seems flat in the local vicinity, there is a third
less obvious spatial dimension which causes the two easily recognized spatial
dimensions to lose their apparent orthogonal relationship over larger areas
of the surface.   The real motion of a position on an expanding spherical
surface is confined to a radius at right angles to the surface from the inaccessible
center.   But to the inhabitants on its surface, the positions <em>seem</em>
 constrained to move along only the two spatial dimensions they recognize
without trouble.   </p>
          <p> The same thing happens in Riemann's four-space hypersphere,
but in another dimension.   Three spatial dimensions are obvious to its inhabitants
and seem to exist at right angles to each other.   Not noticed by its inhabitants,
a less obvious fourth spatial dimension causes the three clearly recognizable
spatial dimensions to lose their apparent orthogonal relationship eventually.
  On a global scale the four-space hypersphere has curved space, although
it doesn't <em>seem</em> to be curved in the local vicinity any more than
the lower-dimensional spherical surface does. </p>
          <p> When a universe with a fourth spatial dimension is referred
in the popular literature, it is  <em>this</em> model - the one studied in
a typical topology course - that is referred to, and I will tell you how
to derive this model within the framework of the "big bang theory".
 </li>
      </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It is interesting to note that Kaluza never attached a "size" to the hypothetical extra dimension.   Although the most popular cosmological model at the time was a Riemannian hypersphere and Kaluza's idea would have been consistent with a "large" dimension in that model, by the mid 1920s it appears the trend was toward a very "small" extra dimension.     </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But what model would have emerged if the astronomical community had assumed Kaluza's insight was actually a "large" fourth spatial dimension that would have confirmed Einstein's early intuition that the universe was most likely to be a "closed cosmic hypersphere" of the Riemannian variety.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>As amazing as it sounds after the better part of a century, this is still an open question and it is a question I will try to answer in these essays.       
 <a name="unknowns">  </a> </p>
       
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>I will not pretend there is anything <em>new</em> in this 4D structure<strong>;</strong> in fact, the four-space hypersphere was first described by the
German mathematician, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Riemann.html">
Georg Bernhard Riemann</a> in his doctoral thesis in 1851.   His mentor was
the eminent <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Gauss.html">
Johann Karl Friedrich Gauss</a>, unquestionably the greatest mathematician
in first half of the nineteenth century and apparently the first scholar
in the scientific era to suspect that the structure of the universe might
not be <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Euclid.html">Euclidean</A>.   
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote> <font color="red">[Incidentally, the first Freudenthal
reference in the Riemann link above describes what I am going to do in this
series of essays.   The very latest data - with some links provided at the start of Essay #3 - indicates that the universe is probably flat, but leaves the door slightly open for a closed universe, if only <em>barely</em> closed.   If you are persistent, you will learn about <em>one</em> version of a "closed universe" described in these essays and see how several anomalies in deep space might be indicating a substantial departure from what most of us have always assumed to be ordinary Euclidean space.] </font> </blockquote>
 <a name="Einstein">  </a> 
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Riemann's hypersphere was the first <em>formal</em> description
of finite but unbounded space.   As already mentioned, Einstein used Riemann's idea to
derive the first "modern" model of the universe, a "static" - that is, non-expanding
- hypersphere which reigned for a little over ten years until Edwin Hubble
announced that the universe <em>was</em> expanding in 1929.   Then this early
hyperspheric model fell by the wayside in the 1930s, when the conventional
cosmological wisdom accepted the notion that one of Friedmann's three variations
was probably the best "fit" for an expanding universe.    </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But as often a hyperspheric universe of one sort or another has
been mentioned as at least a <em>possibility</em>, there are still several
unanswered questions about it, such as<strong>:</strong> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <ul>
 
          <li>Considering what we know about an expanding universe, what
specific assumptions do we make to get a Riemannian four-space hypersphere
(five-space, with time)? </li>
          <li>What is the nature of space in this Riemannian model and how
does it differ from the conventional Friedmann space? </li>
          <li>Is there any observational evidence that favors either Friedmann
space or Riemannian space? </li>
          <li>Is there such a thing as a formal <em>proof</em> that this
vaguely hypothesized and often suggested "finite but unbounded" model actually
exists?    That we unambiguously have Riemannian space instead of Friedmann
space? 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
You'd think that these questions would have been answered a long time ago
and that the answers would appear frequently in FAQ files (Frequently Asked
Questions) or in textbooks. 
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Unfortunately you'd be wrong<strong>;</strong> this is not the
case. </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The answers are not especially complicated, but they involve
two disciplines<strong>:</strong> topology and cosmology.   Since I'm assuming
you're somewhat familiar with the big bang model but don't know that much
about hyperspheres, <a href="hierarchy(1).html">Essay #1</a> describes the
4D (four-dimensional) hypersphere by showing how this structure is related
to its lower-dimensional Euclidean cousins<strong>:</strong> the 2D (two-dimensional)
circle and the 3D (three-dimensional) spherical surface.   This essay also
shows an easy way to visualize the four-space hypersphere by using a subtle
trick in 3D Euclidean geometry.     </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Even though space in a 4D hypersphere <em>seems</em> "spherical"
nearby, exactly how will its   global curvature affect our perception if
we look out far enough?    <a href="perceptions(2).html">Essay #2</a> explains
the very strange observations we'll encounter if we look far enough into
the hypersphere to notice the difference between this space and the conventional
"flat" or Euclidean space.   If actually observed in the universe these anomalies
could, in fact, provide us with a pretty good clue that we <em>do</em> inhabit
this often hypothesized "finite but unbounded" model.  </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In particular, the second essay discusses how a very interesting
position called an "antipode"  would affect our observations if discrete,
luminous objects were near it.   Without stretching credulity too far, several
current observations in deep space actually hint that an antipode <em>might</em>
 be close enough to affect what we see.   Although an antipode could in theory
exist within the visible universe in the closed Friedmann model (provided
the density is much higher than we think it is), the most logical deduction
is that an antipode close enough to affect what we see results from the global
curvature caused by the existence of that long suspected, but ever elusive,
fourth spatial dimension (in Riemann's hypersphere).  </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left><a href="hubhor3.html">Essay #3</a> answers three questions<strong>
:</strong> </p>
<blockquote>        
<ol>
 
          <li>Given what we know about the expanding universe, what assumption
is necessary to get the "closed cosmic hypersphere" <em>with</em> a (large)
fourth spatial dimension? </li>
          <li>Is that assumption realistic? </li>
          <li>Since we'll encounter the antipode at least once in this model,
at what range can we predict it's most likely to occur? </li>
        </ol>
 </blockquote>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Strictly from a topological viewpoint, I believe there <em>is</em>
 a persuasive argument given  in Essay #3 favoring a universe with an "ultra-uncompactified"
fourth spatial dimension, that is, a fourth spatial dimension that exists
in a way that causes the three obvious spatial dimensions to lose their apparent
orthogonal relationship on a large scale.   It depends precisely on how we
define the singularity.   The basic principle is expressed via a very succinct
- and as far as I know <em>original</em> - <a href="hubhor3.html#theorem">
extra dimension theorem</a>. </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left><a href="homden4.html">Essay #4</a> asks which model best explains
the homogeneous nature of space in the universe and shows why our measurements
of the Hubble parameter and the critical density may be too high if the universe
        <em>is</em> a hypersphere and we erroneously assume we occupy a Friedmann
universe. </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The subsequent four short essays - well, Essay #7 on quasars is of intermediate
length, but worth it (I hope!) - give a very cursory overview of several unusual phenomena
in deep space and suggest that a variety of observations <em>might</em> be
consistent with an antipode in the hyperspheric model.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Assuming you're a disciple of  convention, I can't blame you for being skeptical because a concept like this is simply not part of the cosmic curriculum, except as some vague theory usually stuck in an obscure appendix (that you wouldn't even study because you'd know there's no chance you'll get a question on it in any pop quiz or final examination).   But if you look at the anomalies and statistics fairly and start noticing the ever longer litany of head scratching about a variety of oddities in deep space, you'll see the idea goes much further than you think it does.   </p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The first three essays <em>on theory</em> are pretty much "by the numbers" and make
logical deductions based on the simple equation defining the Riemann's 4D
hypersphere.   Essays #5 through #8 give a brief overview of the anomalous observations
in deep space (that is, <em>applications</em>).   These essays indicate that several peculiar observations at high red shifts might actually be consistent with that often hypothesized "finite but unbounded" universe.
</p>
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>And do not be surprised if you ask the same pair of questions I've asked myself many times<strong>:</strong> Are the numbers trying to tell us something?   Or are we trying to read something into the numbers that isn't there? </p>  
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Finally, there are two cautions<strong>:</strong>   </p>
        <ul>
 
          <li> You and I are Euclidean descendants in a line that goes back
about 2,300 years and are understandably xenophobic with respect to any structure
"beyond" our conventional 3D world. &nbsp; That's unfortunate because the
4D hypersphere is not that complicated mathematically or geometrically. &nbsp;
I suggest you place implicit trust in what the numbers are telling you, even
if it seems nonsensical at first in our normal Euclidean world. &nbsp; You'll
find sufficient hand holding in the first three essays and the linked appendices
(essentially extended footnotes) to lead you to a much better understanding
of this model.&nbsp; 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>The general consensus - almost unshakable - is that all observations
occur in one of the three Friedmann models, which include three spatial dimensions
and one time dimension.   It's almost impossible to become a bona fide member
of the cosmological "priesthood" these days without embracing this convention.
 <p> </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Since the original 4D Riemannian hypersphere is around a century and a half old and, whatever the current cosmological fad, fancy, or gospel happens to be, this particular "finite but unbounded" model has never disappeared entirely, I'm just tossing out a freewheeling "it's high time to look at this thing and see if it works".
