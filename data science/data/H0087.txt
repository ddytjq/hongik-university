| Dear Ms. Flora Taylor:
| 
| I am finally a new Sigma Xi member starting this year, but I have subscribed
| to American Scientist for many years and greatly enjoy your book reviews.
| 
| As a kind of hobby I maintain a list of left handed DNA images:
| 
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| Although most images were correct, your recent issue made it into the list
| (item #95 of 2000).  That image is not on the web, but I would like to
| include it on my page.  Could you send me the image and give me permission to
| use it on the page?  I would add any copyright notice that you require.
| 
| Thank you.
| 
| Sincerely yours,

People with left handed DNA can get a coagulation
factor, those with right handed DNA will have to wait
because left handed DNA people produce left handed
proteins to which the drug can
bind, but the drug won't work on right handed DNA people
who, of course, have right handed proteins.
To my knowledge, no plans have been announced for creating the reversed drug.

| Dear Tom,
| 
| Thanks again for your note on the links. We'll sort that out as soon as out
| IT man comes back from an 'assignment' in the U.S.
| 
| Apologies for mixing up the two sites - and indeed the two images are
| different.
| We have been using these images for a long time now (since 1997 in fact --
| should they be in your bumper 1997 list?--) and are in the process of
| phasing them out - indeed you refer to the fact that an enlarged view of the
| website image can be seen in the link when we had already reduced the size
| of this image to fit in with our new designs.
| While your second site does appear to be poking fun at us, implying that our
| link names are suggestions for a new nomenclature, we can take a joke, and I
| am happy to grant permission for the use of this image.
| 
| Best wishes and Happy Hunting for further images,
| 
| Gerald Martin.

"Small Number of

Humans".
Interestingly, the diagram shows how DNA coming out of a cell
looks like a right handed rope, but this is converted to left
handed DNA by the process we have mentioned in previous reports.
Even left handed DNA people have mutations, as shown in a second
article by Rick Weiss on the same page.

As reported in

<a href =
"http://www.sciam.com/2001/0401issue/0401patents.html"
>(April 2001, p.37)</a>,
a patent battle has broken out
over the ownership of
left handed DNA sequences.
Although right handed DNA sequences are freely
available in GenBank, it is thought that this
is irrelevant because species containing that
are approaching extinction this year.

The
<a href =
"http://www.adis.com/journals/ajpharmacogenomics/index.html"
>American Journal of PharmacoGenomics</a>
is a new journal devoted to the specialized but rapidly
growing field of drugs that interact ONLY with humans
that have left handed DNA.
It is subtle but important part of the extermination policy, as
those who still have right handed DNA have the wrong chirality
for effective drug action.
(The image came from Photodisc.)

Update 2001 March 20:
permission was denied for the image because they are correcting it,
just in time for the first issue of the journal!

| Dear Dr Schneider
| 
| Thank you for pointing out that the DNA strand on our cover is incorrect.
| Permission to use the image is not granted since we are taking immediate
| steps to correct it.  The first issue of the new journal will not be
| published until next month so we will correct the cover also.
| 
| Our source was Photodisc which you already have on your site and we bought
| this image in good faith.
| 
| We will forward you the corrected gif as soon as we have it.
|

| Hi,
| 
| You wrote me asking if you could use the lefthanded DNA from the =
| Newsweek cover. In fact we built the DNA righthanded (not because we =
| knew, but just looking at some reference picture) and either the =
| photographer or the photoshop person flipped it. Newsweek called me to =
| ask about it because someone told them it was wrong, perhaps that was =
| you - so I already knew it was printed backwards. I am happy for you to =
| publish it but the photographer and Newsweek both have rights to the =
| image. You should ask the Newsweek cover editor. I don't know who =
| photographed it. Good luck

I responded:
| Hmm.  I'm rather confused about which image this is related to.

| Tom,
| 
| Ok. We do have two DNAs on the web site. The second one is at: =
| http://jhmodels.com/pages/Newsweek.htm.

| 
| Again, for my part it's fine to add them to your web site.

decodes left handed DNA.
Is this really left handed?
It requires some interpretation (decoding).
Because of perspective,
objects closer to the viewer are larger.
The vertical line is probably in the center of the DNA.
If these two statements are true, the image is a left handed helix.

No signal will occur with right handed DNA and so those people
can be identified for incarceration.

| Ok, if Jonathan would like me to do that AND Mark gives me permission for the

I assume that someone there gets Genetic Engineering News. Check out the
T-shirt on page 62 of the November 1 issue.
(I still like the idea...)

<p>
For your first visit to the
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html">Left Handed
Hall of Fame</a>
 page I suggest that you follow the story
over <a href = Leftwhole.html>all of the years</a>.
After that you can look at each year individually
from the table below.
Note:  just because a year has gone by does not mean
we haven't found more examples for that year!

<h1>1997 and 1998 were bumper crop years<br>
and 1999 beat them more than 2 fold.
2000 was a record year, thanks to help from
friends around the world
(60 of the 97 cases, 63%!).
2001 will exceed even that record!
