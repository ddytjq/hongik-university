<p align="center"><b><i><font size="6">Welcome to My Truck Page...</font></i></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3"><i>Here are a few pictures of my 4x4 pickup
and a little info about the truck.. Hope you enjoy your time here and the
pictures...For the Past 3 Years I have been trying to get a vehicle financed but
have came across a stumbling part due to stupidity when I was younger which
screwed up my credit.. I tried several Dealerships in the Calgary Alberta Area
and had been turned down from everyone, even when they said we can finance
anyone, Well started to wonder if the so called sales men really tried.. Well I
was reading a newspaper in Calgary and came across a ad in there from a
dealership and gave them a call.. To my shock I actually got a salesman that was
willing to work with me to get me into a vehicle, we played telephone tag for a
week and he said you need to do this to get this truck, So I did what he asked
for me still wondering if this will work out and well I kept my word to him and
he did to me and 2 weeks later he got me into a truck I wanted... This
dealership took a chance with me and gave me a chance and this sale man worked
with me and wanted to sale.. This Dealership was <a href="http://www.eastsidechrysler.com/" target="_blank">Eastside
Chrysler</a> and that Salesman Was Brent Vargo, I thank them immensely for
working with me and ask anyone if they looking for a vehicle please go see them
when you are in the Calgary Area and Tell Brent Bill Erickson sent ya..</i></font></b></p>
