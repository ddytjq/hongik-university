<p> <img alt="A" align="left" src="/pictures/letters/A.gif" width= "47"
height="46" />nti-evolutionist Ashby Camp has penned a <a
href="http://www.trueorigin.org/theobald1a.asp">critique</a> of these "<a
href="/faqs/comdesc/">29 Evidences of Macroevolution</a>," which can be found
posted at <a href="http://www.trueorigin.org/index.asp">TrueOrigin</a>. Camp's
critique is well-written, very thorough, and quite lengthy (the criticism is
longer than the original article). Although I intend to address Camp's concerns
in totality, currently I can only devote a limited amount of time to this
effort. In the meantime, this partial response will suffice. I would like to
thank Camp for his congenial criticism. It has given me the impetus to rework
and expand the "29 Evidences," and the result is a more comprehensive, clearer,
and stronger article. </p>

<p> My response has been two-fold. First, I have incorporated new material into
the original essay that specifically addresses many of Camp's points, and thus
much of his response is now superfluous. Second, in the following sections I
rebut the more egregious errors found in Camp's criticism, especially ones that
would interrupt the flow and thrust of the original article if they were
included there. In the following response, Camp's words are indented in <span
class="grey">grey boxes</span>, set apart from mine. Material that Camp has
quoted in his criticism is also in the <span class="grey">grey boxes</span>,
surrounded by quotes, and followed by the pertinent external reference. </p>

<p> Mr. Camp's critique is error-ridden in various ways, and is primarily
characterized by: </p>

<ol>
<li>Straw man arguments</li>

<li>Red herrings</li>

<li>Self-contradictions</li>

<li>Equivocation</li>

<li>Two wrongs make a right</li>

<li>Fallacies of accident and converse accident</li>

<li>Ignoratio elenchi</li>

<li>Naive theological assumptions</li>

<li>Insufficient knowledge of basic biology, molecular biology, biochemistry
and genetics</li>

<li>Misunderstanding of the scientific method</li>

<li>Forwarding of untestable competing "hypotheses"</li>

<li>Mischaracterization of evolutionary theory</li>

<li>Misleading mis-quotes</li>

<li>Fallacies of accent</li>

<li>Distortion of scientific controversies</li>

<li>Arguments from authority</li>

<li>False analogies</li>
</ol>

<p> The repeated use of these errors and others in Camp's "Critique" will be
abundantly clear in the following rebuttal. </p>

<p> <b>Note:</b> Since the time I wrote this reply, Mr. Camp has responded to
this in a shorter article entitled "<a

<p> Although Camp is most likely simply trying to paraphrase the point
succinctly, he distorts the intent in doing so. The prediction is more specific
than the above. To quote from the original <a href="section1.html#pred1"
target="_blank">prediction 1</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Some of the macroscopic properties that characterize all of life are (1)
replication, (2) information flow in continuity of kind, (3) catalysis, and (4)
energy utilization (metabolism) .... all living species today should
necessarily have ... inherited the <i>structures</i> that perform these
functions. The genealogical relatedness of all life predicts that organisms
should be very <i>similar in the particular mechanisms and structures</i> that
execute these basic life processes." (emphasis added) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Which traits should be in common was and is expressly stated - the
structures and mechanisms that perform the four basic life functions. </p>

<p> Camp does not consider his paraphrase to be a <a

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">

come from the same gun because they have one or more traits in common?
Specifying the traits (striations) does not affect the nature of the argument
... </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> "Encompassing" a claim is not stating the claim, just as the United States
is not Colorado. Camp's gun-and-bullet example certainly is a straw man. We
cannot infer that two bullets came from the same gun if they have just any two
traits in common. For instance, two bullets might be both made of lead or they
might both weigh the same. Can we thus infer that they both came from the same
gun? No - that inference is only valid when it is based upon traits that are
caused by a particular gun, such as specific striations. Rephrasing the
argument as Camp does is a <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/straw.htm">straw man</a>, since
the rephrased argument is a weaker form of the real argument, and since the
weaker form is much easier to criticize. Specifying the traits certainly does
change the nature of the argument, because the valid inference is solely based
upon <i>certain types</i> of traits (for bullets, those traits caused by a
specific gun; for common descent, those traits strongly constrained by
gradualism). </p>

<p> Camp's clear use of the <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/straw.htm">straw man fallacy</a>
so early in his "Critique," and his subsequent confusion regarding its
definition and usage, does not bode well for the efficacy of the remainder of
his article. </p>

<h3>Conflation of mechanism with gradualism</h3>

<p> Camp writes: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> Unless one inserts an additional premise imposing a limit on the degree to
which descendants can vary (which would require specification of a mechanism of
descent), the claim of common ancestry does not require that all of the
descendants share one or more traits. There is no <i>logical</i> reason why
completely novel organisms could not arise in one or more lineages. Absent
specification of a mechanism of descent, which Dr. Theobald purposefully
avoids, there is no way to tether the traits of the descendants to those of the
common ancestor. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In fact, there <i>are</i> limits on the degree to which descendants can
vary. The constraint of gradualism is inherent in the theory of universal
common descent - a point made explicitly in the original article. To quote from
the introduction: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "... macroevolution is proposed to occur on a geological timescale and in a
gradual manner .... Gradualness concerns genetically probable organismic
changes between two consecutive generations, i.e. those changes that are within
the range of normal variation observed within modern populations." </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Elsewhere in his criticism (e.g., <a href=
"http://www.trueorigin.org/theobald1b.asp#6" target="_blank">footnote 6</a>),
Camp bemoans the article's indifference to mechanism in explaining the evidence
for common descent. Throughout the article, it is assumed that the fundamentals
of biology (such as genetics, molecular biology, and developmental biology) are
correct, especially those not directly dealing with the origin and evolution of
biological adaptations. In creation-evolution debates this is not especially
controversial; nearly all anti-evolutionists, including those who believe in
special creation, also make this assumption. Though gradualism is not formally
a mechanism of evolution (like natural selection or Lamarckism could be),
gradualism does indeed put severe constraints on possible macroevolutionary
phenomena, and it also constrains any possible mechanisms. Thus, Camp is
incorrect when he says: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> ... universal common ancestry is compatible with <i>all</i> mechanisms of
common descent, including divine direction. So if God chose to have a reptile
give birth to a bird, for example, that would be consistent with an
"amechanistic" argument for universal common ancestry. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> A modern reptile giving birth to a modern bird is not gradual; it is
saltation, since such changes between two consecutive generations are not
genetically probable - they are not "within the range of normal variation
observed within modern populations." This is not to say that God could not have
created species independently and miraculously, yet gradually. While there
currently is absolutely no scientific evidence for such an idea, <i>gradual</i>
Divine direction of evolution is indeed consistent and compatible with common
descent. In <a href="http://www.trueorigin.org/theobald1b.asp#1"
target="_blank">footnote 1</a>, Camp paradoxically criticizes the constraint of
gradualism: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> In restricting the mechanism of macroevolution to observable degrees of
genetic variation, Dr. Theobald lets in the back door the very debate about
mechanism that he tossed out the front. He thereby assumes the burden of
proving that accumulated observable variation can account for universal common
ancestry. Since he makes no attempt to meet that burden but rather repeatedly
disavows the relevance of any particular mechanism of modification, I assume he
did not intend to specify accumulated observable variation as the mechanism of
macroevolution, despite what his definitions may suggest. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> As stated earlier, though gradualism is not a mechanism, it does indeed
constrain possible explanatory mechanisms. Common descent is not concerned with
exactly <i>how</i> adaptive change has happened, but <i>whether</i> it has
happened and <i>whether it is consistent</i> with normal observed genealogical
processes. Camp is wrong to say that the sufficiency of "accumulated observable
variation" to account for universal common descent is left unaddressed. This
requirement was and is explicitly considered in Part 5, "<a href=
"section5.html">Change and Mutability</a>," specifically in predictions 
<a href="section5.html#pred22">22</a>,
<a href="section5.html#pred23">23</a>,
<a href="section5.html#pred24">24</a>,
<a href="section5.html#pred28">28</a>,
and <a href="section5.html#pred29">29</a>. </p>

<h3>The <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/accent.htm">Fallacy
of Accent</a></h3>

<p> Camp has replied: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> ... one must recall that Dr. Theobald claimed in his article to prove
universal common ancestry "independent of <i>any</i> explanatory mechanism."
... The point, however, is that the requirement of gradualness restricts the
universe of mechanisms. So if one's argument for common ancestry assumes
gradualism, one is not arguing for common ancestry "independent of <i>any</i>
explanatory mechanism." Rather, one is making an argument for common ancestry
that is dependent on gradual explanatory mechanisms. ... Rather than
acknowledge that he overstated his case, Dr. Theobald ignores his contradictory
statements and blames me for not knowing that he really meant to restrict the
explanatory mechanisms to gradual ones. If that was his intent, he should not
have claimed that he was arguing for common ancestry "independent of any
explanatory mechanism." He was trying to have his cake and eat it too. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> The statement that "the evidence and the conclusion [of common descent] are
independent of any explanatory mechanism" was made on the very last page of the
article. By placing it there, I assumed that the reader had in fact read the
introduction and the rest of the article. At first, I was at a loss for
understanding how Mr. Camp could so blatantly misrepresent the stance on
mechanism put forth in the "29 Evidences." However, now it is clear Mr. Camp
himself wrongly assumes that "any" is equivalent to "all." Saying that common
descent is independent of any explanatory mechanism is not the same as saying
that common descent is independent of <i>all possible</i> explanatory
mechanisms (see definitions 1a, 2a, 2c, and 3b for <a
href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?any"><i>any</i></a> in the
Merriam-Webster Dictionary, or the first two definitions of <a
href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/cmd_search.asp?searchword=any
&amp;dict=B"><i>any</i></a> in the Cambridge International Dictionary of
English). Camp misleadingly places emphasis upon the word "any." I did not
emphasize the word "any" as Camp did when he quoted my statement; this is an
example of the <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/accent.htm">fallacy of
accent</a>. Even if one incorrectly interprets the somewhat ambiguous word
"any" as "all," all mechanisms are not valid <i>explanatory</i> mechanisms. The
gradualistic restriction of explanatory mechanisms is and was explicitly made
numerous times throughout the "29 Evidences" (e.g. all of <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section3.html">Part 3</a> is
devoted to the direct consequences of this concept - note the quote at the
heading). The concept of gradualism and the resulting constraints pervade the
article. Indeed, Camp <i>is</i> to be blamed for not knowing a basic and
explicit element of an argument which he is criticizing. Must every definition
and concept be re-explained in every paragraph? Camp has provided us with yet
another classic example of an anti-evolutionist pulling a comment out of
context and interpreting it in opposition to the author's intent, with complete
disregard for other pertinent, explicit, and clarifying statements. </p>

<h3>A Misunderstanding of Evolutionary Fundamentals</h3>

<p> Camp continues with ReMine's words: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> "Second, even if life originated precisely once, then evolutionary theory
would still not predict biologic universals. Shortly after life's origin,
nothing prevented life from branching and leading separate lineages to higher
life forms entirely lacking the known biologic universals. </p>

<p> Third, evolutionary loss and replacement processes could prevent biologic
universals. If one organism is a distant ancestor to another, then nothing in
evolution predicts the two must share similarities. If evolution were true,
then distant ancestors and descendants (as well as sister groups) can be
totally different." (<a href="#Remine1993">Remine 1993</a>, p. 92-93) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Here Camp again dismisses the fundamentals of biology and the constraint of
gradualism. Common descent <i>does</i> predict specific biological universals,
since any significant change (any "loss and replacement processes") in the
structures that perform the four basic life functions would result in nonviable
organisms; these structures cannot be lost nor can they be replaced (although
they can be expounded upon). Once life attained these specific structures (by
whatever process), they were essentially frozen. Gradualism constrains life
from "branching and leading separate lineages to higher life forms entirely
lacking the known biologic universals." Of course "distant ancestors and
descendants ... can be totally different" - totally different <i>except</i> in
the structures that perform the four fundamental functions of life. </p>

<p> Common descent does not predict that these structures must be identical,
just that the similarity must be statistically significant, and that there must
be viable intermediates between the variations. For instance, because the
genetic code is degenerate, common descent does not predict an <i>identical</i>
genetic code in all organisms. However, all known genetic codes are extremely
similar, with an extremely high degree of statistical significance. In fact,
common descent does not require that all organisms even have a genetic code. If
life evolved from something that lacked a genetic code, then there must have
been a series of organisms with transitional codes, beginning with no code at
all. It is at least possible that such organisms could still be alive today.
But if common descent is true, then the genetic codes of these organisms would
be less complex versions of the modern genetic code and would retain
statistically significant similarity to the modern universal genetic code. This
is a testable prediction, in principle. </p>

<p> That said, the main important point of "prediction 1" is this - we can make
very strong <i>a posteriori</i> predictions about biological universals by
combining common descent with what is known. As a scientific analogy, Newton's
Theory of Universal Gravitation does not predict planets, nor does it predict
the present trajectories of planets. But given the known measured trajectory of
an existing planet, we can use Newton's theory to predict what the trajectory
will be in the future and what it must have been in the past, and these
predictions can be confirmed or falsified. Likewise, given the fact that we now
know that all organisms studied to date, including bacteria and birds, have a
very similar glycolysis metabolic pathway (or genetic code), we can use common
descent to predict that all undiscovered or unexamined organisms that fit
between bacteria and birds in the standard phylogenetic tree will also have a
similar glycolysis metabolic pathway (or genetic code). Because of common
descent, we predict this even though this prediction is not functionally
necessary - many other equivalent glycolysis pathways or genetic codes could
function equally well. Because of common descent, we know that certain types of
organisms will be extremely similar in the biological universals before we
actually go and check the organisms to see what their structures really look
like. Thus, Hunter is incorrect when Camp quotes him saying: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> "Consider how evolutionists would react if there were in fact multiple
codes in nature. What if plants, animals, and bacteria all had different codes?
Such a finding would not falsify evolution; rather, it would be incorporated
into the theory ... " (<a href="#Hunter2001">Hunter 2001</a>, p. 38) </p></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> <a id="genetic_code" name="genetic_code"></a>First, common descent
<i>does</i> predict that the genetic codes should be similar <i>a priori</i>.
Hunter is speculating about how evolutionists would have reacted in a
hypothetical historical scenario in which we did not find highly similar codes
between organisms. In reality, we can never know how biologists would have
reacted to that, since that hypothetical scenario did not happen. What
<i>is</i> known, however, is that the scientists who cracked the genetic code
in the 1950's and 1960's worked under the assumption that the code was
universal or nearly so (<a href="#Judson1996">Judson 1996</a>, p. 280-281).
These scientists, which included Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner, George Gamow,
and several others, all made this assumption and justified it based upon
evolutionary reasoning, even in the complete absence of any experimental
evidence. In fact, this assumption was instrumental in their success in solving
the code. For instance, in 1957, nearly ten years before the genetic code was
finally solved, Sydney Brenner published an influential paper in which he
concluded that all overlapping triplet codes were impossible if the code was
universal (<a href="#Brenner1957">Brenner 1957</a>). This paper was widely
considered a landmark work, since many researchers were leaning towards an
overlapping code. Of course, it turned out that Brenner was correct about the
nature of the true code. In 1961, five years before the code was deciphered,
Crick and others also concluded that the code was (1) a triplet code, (2)
non-overlapping, and (3) that the code is read from a fixed starting point
(i.e. the "start" codon) (<a href="#Crick_etal1961">Crick et al. 1961</a>).
These conclusions were explicitly based on the assumption that the code was
essentially the same in tobacco, humans, and bacteria, though there was no
empirical support for this assumption. These conclusions turned out to be
correct. In fact, in 1963 - <i>three years before the code was finally
solved</i> - Hinegardner and Engelberg published a paper in <i>Science</i>
specifically explaining why the code must be universal (or nearly so) if
universal common descent were true, since most mutations in the code would
likely be lethal to all living things. Note, Hinegardner and Engelberg did
allow for some variation in the genetic code, and predicted how such variation
should be distributed if found: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "... if different codes do exist they should be associated with major
taxonomic groups such as phyla or kingdoms that have their roots far in the
past." (<a href="#HinegardnerEngelberg1963">Hinegardner and Engelberg 1963</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Their evolutionary prediction was correct, since the minor variations in
the standard genetic code are indeed associated with major taxonomic groups
(vertebrates vs. plants vs. single-celled ciliates, etc.). </p>

<p> Second, we now know from experimental research that many plants, many
animals, and many bacteria all have extremely similar genetic codes. There is
no known biological reason, aside from common descent, for why the genetic
codes of different species should be similar. Any new discovery of a plant,
animal, or bacteria with a radically different genetic code would be a highly
unexpected result if common descent is true, and thus such a discovery would be
a strong falsification. </p>

<h3>The Logical Fallacy of <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/equiv.htm"> Equivocation</a></h3>

<p> Camp continues with Hunter's quote: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> "There is nothing wrong with a theory that is comfortable with different
outcomes, but there is something wrong when one of those outcomes is then
claimed as supporting evidence. If a theory can predict both A and not-A, then
neither A nor not-A can be used as evidence for the theory. When it comes to
the genetic code, evolution can accommodate a range of findings, but it cannot
then use one of those findings as supporting evidence." (<a
href="#Hunter2001">Hunter 2001</a>, p. 38.) </p>
</td> 
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Hunter's logic concerning "A and not-A" is strictly correct, but it is
misapplied. In this case, evolution does not predict "both A and not-A" - it
predicts "both A and B." Hunter <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/equiv.htm"> equivocates</a> by
misidentifying "A and not-A" with a <i>range</i> of predicted outcomes. A range
of outcomes ("A and B") does not necessarily encompass <i>all</i> possible
outcomes ("A and not-A") - thus the <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/equiv.htm"> equivocation</a>. If
a theory predicts both A and B, then either A or B <i>can</i> be used as
evidence for the theory. All scientific theories predict a range of outcomes.
For example, Newtonian physics predicts that projectiles will follow elliptical
paths, parabolic paths, or linear paths, contingent upon the relevant
conditions. Newtonian physics thus predicts A, B, and C, and any of A, B, or C
can be used as evidence for Newtonian physics. This point is important, since
Camp uses this same argument again, incorrectly, in his conclusion. Hunter's
claim that "there is something wrong when one of those [different] outcomes is
then claimed as supporting evidence" is clearly false as a blanket statement
about scientific theories. To rewrite Hunter's incorrect statement: when it
comes to the genetic code, evolution predicts a range of findings, and it can
use any of those findings as supporting evidence. That's how science works.
</p>

<p> Camp further obfuscates the prediction of biological universals by
introducing hypotheses concerning the origin of the universal ancestor. He
writes: </p>

biochemically distinct from modern forms confirms that evolution does not
predict biologic universals. Robert Shapiro, for example, entertains the
possibility of finding living relics of an original protein-based life form
that lacked DNA and RNA. (Shapiro, 293-295.) Likewise, A. G. Cairns-Smith
thinks that descendants of ancient crystalline clay organisms may be all around
us. He states: "Evolution did not start with the organic molecules that have
now become universal to life: indeed I doubt whether the first organisms, even
the first evolved organisms, had any organic molecules in them at all."

<p> First, exactly how the universal ancestor originated and evolved is not
within the realm of common descent; common descent concerns all evolution and
descent from the <i>last</i> common ancestor to the present. Secondly, and most
importantly, these speculative hypotheses have no influence upon certain
predictions of universals, such as the genetic code. The genetic code is a
mechanism to translate nucleic acid information (DNA and/or RNA) into protein.
Shapiro's original life form lacked DNA and RNA - it did not have a genetic
code. Cairns-Smith's crystalline clay organisms had neither protein nor nucleic
acid - thus neither did they have a genetic code. The universality of the
genetic code was proposed based upon two facts: all known life carries genetic
information in nucleic acids, and all known life performs metabolic functions
with proteins. All known life thus has a genetic code. If all known life is
also united by common descent, it must also be united by a universal genetic
code. As recounted above, this was the exact reasoning of Francis Crick, Sydney
Brenner, George Gamow, and Marshall Nirenberg when they were cracking the
genetic code. Camp, and other anti-evolutionists like ReMine, can carp and
criticize - yet the fact remains that real evolutionary biologists, doing hard
science, made predictions and got phenomenal results based upon common descent
and the deduction of biological universals. </p>

<p> On the other hand, ReMine argues that biologic universals are a prediction
of his message theory of creation, which "says all life was constructed to look
like the unified work of a single designer." (ReMine, 94.) So evolution does
not predict the unity of living things, but at least one theory of creation
does. Of course, the biochemical similarity of living things fits easily within
a creation framework. </p>
</td>

</blockquote>

<p> Of course biochemical similarity fits easily in a "creation framework."
Anything can fit in the creation framework. This is precisely why present
anti-evolutionary creationist theories are unscientific; they are not open to
falsification. They are not even real theories or hypotheses. If there were no
biochemical similarity, would that be inconsistent with the "creation
framework"? ReMine's "message" hypothesis is close to being scientifically
valid, but it is much too vague to be tested. What does a "unified work" look
like? How would the biological world look if it were a "divided work"? Can
ReMine quantify "appearance of unity"? Would independent researchers, perhaps
from different cultures and countries, deduce the same predictions from this
"message hypothesis"? Surely not - how something "looks" in terms of unity is
subjective; it is not an objective property of life. How are we to distinguish
between a single designer and multiple designers? Does Microsoft Word or an
iMac or a Nissan Pathfinder look like the result of a single designer or
multiple designers? A more fundamental problem is that ReMine's "message"
hypothesis is not mutually exclusive with common descent, though he and Camp
both seem to think that it is. Many world religions consider the existence of
physical laws, such as the theory of universal gravitation, to be evidence that
the universe is the unified work of a single Designer. In principle, couldn't a
single designer have used evolution to make all of life look like a unified
work? Of course; ReMine's conjecture and common descent could both be true.
</p>

<h3>Naive Theology and Poor Biochemistry</h3>

<p> Camp continues his discussion of how well he believes that creationism can
explain biochemical similarities by quoting this fine piece of "scientific"
creationist reasoning from Duane Gish: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> "A creationist would also expect many biochemical similarities in all
living organisms. We all drink the same water, breathe the same air, and eat
the same food. Supposing, on the other hand, God had made plants with a certain
type of amino acids, sugars, purines, pyrimidines, etc.; then made animals with
a different type of amino acids, sugars, purines, pyrimidines, etc.; and,
finally, made man with a third type of amino acids, sugars, etc. What could we
eat? We couldn't eat plants; we couldn't eat animals; all we could eat would be
each other! Obviously, that wouldn't work. All the key molecules in plants,
animals, and man had to be the same. The metabolism of plants, animals, and
man, based on the same biochemical principles, had to be similar, and therefore
key metabolic pathways would employ similar macromolecules, modified to fit the
particular internal environment of the organism or cell in which it must
function." (Gish, 277.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Both Gish and Camp obviously feel that God is extremely limited in
ingenuity. Gish's contention is ridiculous; why couldn't God have created
plants with one certain type of amino acids and animals with another type, and
simply given animals the enzymes that metabolize plant amino acids? Wouldn't
that be clever design? Obviously, that <i>would</i> work, and all the key
molecules in plants, animals, and man did not have to be the same. Now, I am
not stating that God should have made things this way, but I am certainly
questioning the naive theological assumption made by Gish and Camp that God was
incapable of creating things this way. </p>

<h3>Another straw man</h3>

<p> Camp ends his criticism of Prediction 1 with this straw man: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The claim that all organisms have one or more traits in common is true in
the sense that all living things necessarily have the traits by which life is
defined, but that is simply a tautology - living things all have the traits of
living things. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> As at the beginning, Camp's paraphrase is incorrect. The above claim is not
the prediction of biological universals; the prediction is that structures
which perform the basic functions that characterize life should be similar.
Living things have the functions of living things (a tautology), but because
all things are related by heredity (i.e. common descent), living things also
should have similar structures and mechanisms that perform these basic
functions (a deduction from common descent). It is possible that living things
could all have the basic functions that characterize life while also having
very different, chemically and structurally unrelated mechanisms that perform
these basic functions. The prediction of biological universals is, therefore,
not tautologous. And, as a deduction of common descent, the prediction of
biological universals is testable, confirmable, and falsifiable. Furthermore,
this prediction has been confirmed and has not been falsified. Like any good
scientific theory, the possibility exists that it may be falsified in the
future by the acquisition of new data, though this is highly unlikely since all
other evidence confirms the validity of common descent. </p>

<h2><a id="pred2" name="pred2"></a>Prediction 2: A nested hierarchy of
species</h2>

<h3>Misrepresentation of Evolutionary Theory and Erroneous Logic</h3>

<p> Camp's argument is simply that descent by modification from a common
ancestor does not predict a nested hierarchy. Camp is just plain incorrect
here; all genealogical processes produce nested hierarchies. Think of your own
family tree - your grandparents might have several kids, each of those kids
(your aunts, uncles, and parents) have their own families, each of the children
in those families (like you) may have their own children and even your children
can have their own families. Each family is nested within another family, which
in turn is nested within another family, and so on. Camp attempts to explain
himself in his refusal to accept this basic concept: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Common descent can explain or accommodate nested hierarchy ... but it does
not predict it. There are mechanisms of descent from a common ancestor that
would yield a different pattern. If common descent can yield either nested
hierarchy or something else, then the presence of nested hierarchy does not
count as evidence of common descent. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp claims that different patterns can result from common descent - it
would be nice if he could give us an example. I infer that the reason he does
not give us examples is because they do not exist. If Camp means that
"randomness" is a pattern (stretching the term "pattern"), then, yes, under
certain conditions common descent predicts that some characters of species will
be random with respect to each other. However, as has been discussed already,
most theories in science predict multiple outcomes contingent upon the relevant
conditions. This is not a problem for any scientific theory. Camp's last
statement above is clearly false; it is the same error discussed above in
Hunter's "A and not-A" claim. Common descent can predict two different outcomes
and it can still use either of those outcomes as supporting evidence. </p>

<h3>Another Misunderstanding of Evolutionary Theory</h3>

<p> Camp has since <a
href="http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_ac_01.asp#b3">replied</a> to this criticism:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> ... the claim that the hypothesis of universal common ancestry makes a
falsifiable prediction that organisms will exhibit a pattern of nested
hierarchy is incorrect. Indeed, Dr. Theobald acknowledged in both prediction 2
and the response to my critique that Lamarck's organic progression would yield
a non-nested pattern of organisms. ... since Lamarck's organic progression (to
pick one example) admittedly does not predict a nested hierarchy, a nested
hierarchy is not evidence of common descent via Lamarck's organic progression.
Therefore, it is not evidence of common descent regardless of "whether
Darwinism, Lamarckism, or something else is the true mechanism of evolutionary
change," which is the proposition being argued by Dr. Theobald. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote> 

<p> Although Camp still does not provide us with an example of a non-nested
pattern generated by common descent, he does think that Lamarck's organic
progression would predict a non-nested pattern. Camp is correct. However, Camp
does not understand the difference between Lamarckism (or inheritance of
acquired characters), which is an evolutionary mechanism, and the Lamarckian
organic progression, which is not an evolutionary mechanism but is a
descriptive macroevolutionary theory. <i>Of course</i> Lamarck's organic
progression does not predict a nested hierarchy - it is mutually exclusive with
common descent. Lamarck's organic progression is a competing theory, and common
descent and the organic progression cannot both be true. However, Lamarckian
evolution (by inheritance of acquired characters) could, in principle, be a
mechanism of change that drives common descent by gradual modification. Camp's
discussion here just proves my point. If we observed a pattern like that
predicted by the organic progression, it would strongly indicate that common
descent was false and that the organic progression was true. In other words,
Lamarck's organic progression predicts a non-nested pattern - if we observed
that pattern, it would falsify common descent. </p>

<h3>Poor Logic and Outdated Science</h3>

<p> Camp then tries to support this misunderstanding with another quote from
Hunter: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> "It has been known since Aristotle that species tend to cluster in a
hierarchical pattern, and in the eighteenth century Linnaeus saw it as a
reflection of the Creator's divine plan. Obviously this pattern does not force
one to embrace evolution." (<a href="#Hunter2001">Hunter 2001</a>, p. 107.)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> It seems clear to me that Hunter is implying that since the hierarchical
pattern of species was known before the theory of common descent was proposed,
then the hierarchical pattern cannot be used as evidence for common descent.
According to such logic, Newton's Theory of Gravity is also suspect. It has
been known since long before Aristotle that apples fall to the ground when
dropped. Some people before Newton, such as Aristotle, thought that apples were
attracted to the ground because they were primarily made of the "earth"
element. Obviously this pattern (falling) does not force one to embrace the
inverse square law. It should be clear that the fact that people were wrong
about physical explanations in the past is not an argument against modern
scientific theories. </p>

<p> However, in private correspondence, Hunter has vociferously objected to my
interpretation of his comments given above. Hunter claims that he was simply
pointing out that alternative "theories" can explain the observed nested
hierarchy. For such a point to be valid, the alternate "theories" would need to
be of equal scientific rank as the theory of common descent. To my knowledge,
neither Aristotle nor Linnaeus proposed any hypothesis concerning the nested
hierarchy, and neither of them ever made any testable predictions based on any
hypothesis proposed to explain the nested hierarchy. In contrast, common
descent has certainly been proposed as a hypothesis which predicts the nested
hierarchy, and many predictions based upon universal common descent have been
made and tested by evolutionary biologists within the past 140 years. As such,
the philosophical and theological ideas of Aristotle and Linnaeus do not
compete scientifically with the formal hypothesis of common descent.
Furthermore, there is no reason why the theological significance Linnaeus
attached to the nested hierarchy should exclude common descent; it is of course
possible for a theist to see the theory of common descent, and the hierarchy
which it predicts, as a reflection of the Creator's divine plan, much as Sir
Isaac Newton saw his laws of motion, and the ellipses and parabolas which they
predict, as evidence of the Creator's hand in our universe. </p>

<h3>Another Red Herring: 19th Century Science is Not Modern Science</h3>

<p> Hunter's quote continues: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> "Also, Darwin's law of natural selection does not predict this pattern. He
had to devise a special explanation - his <i>principle of divergence</i> - to
fit this striking pattern into his overall theory." (<a

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Branching or divergence of species (i.e. speciation) is an inherent part of
common descent. Darwin's <i>principle of divergence of character</i> was his
particular explanation for speciation, for how varieties eventually evolve to
become separate species. It was not "devised" as a "special explanation";
Darwin cogently argued that it was a necessary result of natural selection. </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for the more
organic beings diverge in structure, habits and constitution, by so much the
more can a large number be supported on the area, of which we see proof by
looking to the inhabitants of any small spot, and to the productions
naturalised in foreign lands. Therefore, during the modification of the
descendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all
species to increase in numbers, the more diversified the descendants become,
the better will be their chance of success in the battle for life. Thus the
small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend
to increase, till they equal the greater differences between species of the
same genus, or even of distinct genera." (From the summary of Chapter 4,
<i>Natural Selection</i>, Darwin 1872, p. 169) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> However, Darwin's specific principle is unnecessary for common descent to
produce a nested hierarchy - all that is necessary is speciation and change in
characters, regardless of cause. Most importantly, the views of this 19th
century naturalist, though interesting historically, are of no consequence
whatsoever for the validity of modern evolutionary theories. Camp's insertion
of Darwin's views into a debate about modern science is a red herring (or a
straw man, either one). Camp has replied: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> According to Dr. Theobald, Darwin's principle of divergence is simply
another name for ("is otherwise known as") common descent. The principle of
divergence was an addition to the bare notion of common descent that "Darwin
believed necessary to account for the diverging, tree-like relationships of
organisms" (quote from the Darwin Project at the University of Cambridge, <a
href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Departments/Darwin/intros/vol6.html"
>http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Departments/Darwin/intros/vol6.html</a>).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> As stated above, Darwin's "principle of divergence of character" is 19th
century science, not modern science, so the point is moot. That said, Camp is
incorrect. The following discussion is solely for clarification of Darwin's
views. </p>

<p> Darwin's principle of divergence was not "an addition to the bare notion of
common descent" - if anything, it was an addition to the bare notion of natural
selection. In fact, Darwin saw the "principle of divergence" as a
<i>deduction</i> from natural selection acting on closely related populations
in different environments. As Darwin states in his introduction to <b>The
Origin of Species</b>, </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "This fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some
length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural selection
almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life,
and leads to what I have called divergence of character." (<a
href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, pp. 21-22) </p>

<p> "Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of
character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of
life." (<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, pp. 169-170) </p>

<p> "... it [the pattern of nested hierarchies] is explained through
inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction
and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram." (<a
href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p. 170) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> It is possible to have common descent without natural selection, and it is
possible to have natural selection without common descent. Darwin's principle
tied the two together. As stated above, Darwin's "principle of divergence of
character" was his particular explanation for how natural selection led to
speciation, as Darwin wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between
varieties and species, namely, that the amount of difference between varieties,
when compared with each other or with their parent-species, is much less than
that between the species of the same genus. But when we come to discuss the
principle, as I call it, of divergence of character, we shall see how this may
be explained, and how the lesser differences between varieties tend to increase
into the greater differences between species." (<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin
1872</a>, pp. 84-85) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> In Chapter 4, Darwin formally introduces and explains his "principle of
divergence of character." There he clearly postulates it as a consequence of
natural selection working on similar populations in different environments,
thus leading to speciation. Darwin begins his section on the principle of
divergence with a question: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "The principle [of divergence] is of high importance, and explains, as I
believe, several important facts. In the first place, varieties, even
strongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the character of species [...]
yet certainly differ far less from each other than do good and distinct
species. Nevertheless according to my view, varieties are species in the
process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient species. How,
then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the
greater difference between species?" (<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p.
143) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Darwin answers this question with his principle of divergence, and he
explains how it can act in both domesticated and wild organisms. Then, he uses
his proposed concepts of (1) speciation by the principle of divergence and (2)
change by natural selection to demonstrate how a branching tree-like genealogy
of species will naturally develop: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "After the foregoing discussion [of the principle of divergence], which has
been much compressed, we may assume that the modified descendants of any one
species will succeed so much the better as they become more diversified in
structure, and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings.
Now let us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of
character, combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction,
tends to act. </p>

<p> The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather
perplexing subject. ..." (<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p. 148-150)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Darwin then describes common descent using his <a
href="CDhierarchy.html">famous figure</a>, the <a
href="CDphylogeny.html">tree-like phylogeny</a>, which graphically represents
the predicted nested hierarchies. Note that the nested hierarchy is a
consequence of only speciation and change in character, which Darwin explained
by use of the principle of divergence and natural selection, respectively. From
this discussion it is clear that Camp is incorrect to state that the "principle
of divergence was an addition to the bare notion of common descent." The
principle of divergence was combined with evolution by natural selection to
<i>deduce</i> common descent with nested hierarchies. In fact, anytime there is
speciation, that is also common descent, so in a sense the principle of
divergence <i>is</i> common descent (though it is a special case caused by the
action of natural selection on different populations in different
environments). </p>

<h3> More Misrepresentation of Evolutionary Theory and Misunderstanding of the
Scientific Method: </h3>

<h4>Walter ReMine's Views of the Nested Hierarchy</h4>

<p> Camp appears to be confused about whether common descent must include
branching of species or not: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Even a mechanism of descent that includes branching events does not ensure
a nested pattern. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> If multiple species evolved from a common ancestor, how could they have
arisen without branching? "One" turning into "two" necessarily includes a
branching event. Divergence (i.e. speciation) is thus <i>inherent</i> in the
concept of common descent. Again, think about a family tree. Genealogies branch
and diverge. The very essence of common descent is that all species are related
like individuals in a genealogy. </p>

<p> Camp then quotes ReMine in support of his misunderstanding of the
prediction of nested hierarchies: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> "The pattern of descent depends on the extent that evolved characters are
later lost. Suppose losses are significant, and characters are replaced at a
high rate. Then there is no reason to expect a nested pattern. Descendants
could be totally different from their distant ancestors and sister groups, with
little or no semblance of nested similarities linking them." (ReMine, 343.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> ReMine is partially correct, yet errs large. If rates of evolution are
fast, then the cladistic information indeed can be lost given enough time,
since the cladistic information would be essentially randomized. The faster the
rate, the less time needed to obliterate the information in biological
characters about the historical branching pattern of evolution. Slowly evolving
characters let us see farther back into time; faster evolving characters
restrict that view to more recent events. This is a difficulty that biologists
must deal with in reality. But, importantly, it is also a prediction of common
descent. Given a certain rate of evolution, we can determine how long it will
take for cladistic information to be lost. ReMine forgets that "rate of
evolution" vs. "time since divergence" is relative; thus, in some time frame we
will always be able to observe a nested hierarchy if common descent is true.
Furthermore, we know empirically that background mutation rates vary by orders
of magnitude from locus to locus in the genomes of species. This fact means
that hierarchies should be observed at many biological levels, since some genes
evolve faster or slower than others. </p>

<p> ReMine thinks that since there are certain conditions under which a
prediction of our theory will not be observed, then observing the prediction is
not a confirmation of our theory. If this were true, we could never confirm any
scientific hypothesis, not just common descent, since there are always certain
conditions under which we will be unable to observe some consequence of a
theory. </p>

<p> All ReMine is saying is that, under certain conditions, common descent
predicts that hierarchical structure will be randomized. It is unclear why this
is a problematic feature of the theory of common descent. Under certain
conditions, Newtonian theory predicts that objects will not follow elliptical
orbits, but that they will follow parabolas. Are we thus supposed to conclude
that observing the elliptical orbits of the planets cannot be used as evidence
for Newtonian theory? No, and the same is true for common descent. This is the
same error as Hunter's "A and not-A" discussion addressed above. ReMine simply
does not understand how the scientific method works. </p>

<p> Camp has since contested my criticism of ReMine's arguments: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> This is a mischaracterization of ReMine's position. ReMine is not claiming
that fulfillment of a theory's falsifiable prediction (e.g., the mutual
attraction of two masses decreases in proportion to the square of the distance
between them) is nullified by an inability to test the prediction under certain
circumstances (e.g., where the attraction is predictably below measurable
limits). </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> The phrase "inability to test" is misstated. We can <i>always</i> test - it
is only <i>after</i> testing that we compare the results to our predictions.
Camp's misstatement is just a further indication of an underlying
misunderstanding and unfamiliarity with scientific practice. If we assume that
something is untestable beforehand then we are assuming the truth of our theory
- we are not testing it. How could we know that the attraction between two
objects is "predictably below measurable limits" unless we are already assuming
that the Theory of Gravity is true? We cannot; we must test that prediction and
see if we really are unable to measure the attraction when, using our theory,
we predict that the attraction should be too small to measure. What Camp must
mean here, to make sense scientifically, is "inability to observe a given
prediction." In fact, this <i>is</i> exactly what ReMine is claiming - there is
no mischaracterization. ReMine claims that fulfillment of a theory's
falsifiable prediction (e.g., the observation of a "nested pattern") is
nullified by an inability to observe the prediction under certain circumstances
(e.g., when the hierarchy is predictably randomized because "losses are
significant, and characters are replaced at a high rate"). As stated above,
this claim is identical to Hunter's "A and not-A" equivocation. Theories
predict a range of outcomes; observing one of those outcomes and not the others
(contingent upon the relevant conditions) is still evidence for the theory. </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> Rather, he [ReMine] is claiming that nested hierarchy is not a falsifiable
prediction of common ancestry because the theory includes without restriction
processes that work against that pattern. Those processes can be invoked in any
blend to account for any non-nested pattern that is observed. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Well, ReMine is <i>also</i> making this claim. However, ReMine and Camp are
both incorrect in stating that it is problematic to invoke processes that "work
against" a prediction of a theory. For example, with Newton's Theory of
Gravity, there are plenty of things that can be invoked to account for
anomalous results. For instance, naively, feathers and bowling balls supposedly
fall at the same rate. If dropped from the same height, they should hit the
ground at the same time - that is, if the theory is correct. But we all know
that is untrue. Feathers fall more slowly, and we invoke another process, air
resistance, to explain why feathers fall in a way not predicted by the theory.
But there is more - electrons and protons do not follow the gravitational
inverse square law either. We invoke electric charge to explain that.
Refrigerator magnets also "violate" the Theory of Gravity. Here we invoke a
process, magnetism, that works against the patterns predicted by Newton's
theory. In some cases, like three- or four-body problems, we admit that
Newton's theory fails to give an exact answer. When we are only considering two
objects, like the Sun and the earth, we can solve the equations of motion
exactly. But add just one more element, like the moon, and the equations are
impossible to solve (though the answers can sometimes be approximated). In
other cases, as with the orbit of Mercury, we drop Newton's theory altogether
and invoke relativistic effects. </p>

<p> In reality, <i>all</i> scientific explanations are complex, except in the
most unrealistic, contrived situations found in carefully controlled laboratory
environments. In a lab, we can remove the air from a container and watch a
bowling ball and a feather fall at the same rate. In contrast, we cannot
simplify things like that when we try to calculate the terminal velocity of a
falling body in our atmosphere. As stated elsewhere here, processes cannot "be
invoked in any blend to account for any [...] pattern." Complex explanations
are required to be reasonable and to conform to empirically observed processes
- they are not invoked "without restriction." All the processes that ReMine and
Camp complain about have been empirically observed, and they are testable
propositions. Evolutionary biology, thus, is no more problematic than any other
scientific discipline. To repeat, ReMine simply does not understand how the
scientific method works. </p>

<p> Mr. Camp uses an additional quote from ReMine with the intent to criticize
common descent and the prediction of nested hierarchies: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> "Evolution does not predict a hierarchical pattern. Simple processes of
loss, replacement, anagenesis, transposition, unmasking, or multiple biogenesis
would prohibit such a pattern. Since hierarchical patterns (such as cladograms
or phenograms) are not predicted by evolution they are not evidence for
evolution." (<a href="#ReMine1993">ReMine 1993</a>, p. 444.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> However, Camp has misquoted ReMine. ReMine is not specifically referring to
common descent in this passage; he is writing about evolution <i>in
general</i>. ReMine keeps common descent and evolution distinct (as he should).
For instance, multiple biogenesis is not common descent. This is clear from the
very next sentence that follows the quote above: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Life's hierarchical pattern (as displayed in cladograms and phenograms) is
too indirect to establish even the special case of common descent." (<a
href="#ReMine1993">ReMine 1993</a>, p. 444.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> ReMine considers common descent to be a special case of evolution, which of
course it is. But his point that common descent is not a <i>necessary</i> case
of evolution is senseless. It is analogous to criticizing the inverse square
law because it <i>could</i> have been an inverse cube law or an inverse
factorial law. He might as well say - "Gravity does not predict elliptical
orbits. Since elliptical orbits are not predicted by gravity then it is not
evidence for gravity." Which he could have followed with - "Elliptical orbits
(as displayed by planets and projectiles) are too indirect to establish even
the special case of the inverse square law." Despite ReMine's protestations,
nested hierarchies are measurable features of organisms - their presence or
absence can be quantified and evaluated with statistics. The prediction of a
nested hierarchy follows directly from the hypothesis of common descent. </p>

<a id="ReMine_nested" name="ReMine_nested"></a>

<p> Furthermore, ReMine is incorrect in claiming that "loss, replacement,
anagenesis, transposition, unmasking, or multiple biogenesis would prohibit" a
hierarchical pattern. Of course, multiple biogenesis could, but we are not
considering multiple biogenesis, we are considering universal common descent.
The other processes mentioned all <i>create</i> hierarchical patterns, since
character losses, replacements, anagenetic changes, transpositions, and
reversals (unmasking events) are all inherited by descendants of an ancestor.
For example, if all apes are descendants from a long-tailed primate common
ancestor that lost its tail, then all apes will lack tails, while other
primates will have tails. If an ape acquired a gene by transposition into the
germ-line, then all descendants of that ape would inherit that transposition.
If some non-ape primate then had a short tail replace its long tail, then all
descendants of the short-tailed primate would inherit that short tail. The
result is a nested hierarchy. </p>

</pre>

<p> These "simple processes" are the very types of things that make nested
hierarchies. </p>

<p> Since this was written, Camp has <a
href="http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_ac_01.asp#b3">replied</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> There are various ways in which existing organisms could descend from a
common ancestor and not exhibit a nested hierarchy. Anagenesis, loss of
characters, replacement of characters, transposition of characters, atavism
(masking and unmasking), and convergence all work against a hierarchical
pattern, and the bare hypothesis of universal common ancestry says nothing
about the rate or prevalence of those processes. They can be invoked in
whatever blend is necessary to explain whatever pattern is found. Therefore,
the claim that the hypothesis of universal common ancestry makes a falsifiable
prediction that organisms will exhibit a pattern of nested hierarchy is
incorrect. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Notice how Camp's reply avoids all of the points which were made against
his argument. Camp does not provide us with an example of a non-nested pattern
produced by common descent. He reiterates the claim that various processes
destroy a nested pattern, when in fact those very processes <i>create</i> a
nested pattern. These processes cannot be "invoked in whatever blend is
necessary to explain whatever pattern is found." Yes, "bare" common descent may
not state anything specifically about these processes, but universal common
descent <i>is</i> constrained by gradualism, as has been explained many times
over. We know empirically the maximum rates of anagenesis, character loss, and
character replacement - such processes can be used in scientific explanations,
of course, but there are limits on what rates can be used. This was already
addressed specifically in predictions <a href= "section5.html#pred22">22</a>,
<a href= "section5.html#pred23">23</a>, <a href= "section5.html#pred24">24</a>,
<a href= "section5.html#pred28">28</a>, and <a href=
"section5.html#pred29">29</a>. Furthermore, we also know that convergence
happens (it is a prediction of natural selection and is observed regularly in
the wild and in the lab). However, true structural convergence, in which
distantly related taxa perform the same functions with the same underlying
structures, is rare relative to divergence. In fact, when considering DNA
sequence evolution, we can calculate very precisely what rates of convergence
are reasonable and what rates are highly unlikely. </p>

<h4>Michael Denton's Views of the Nested Hierarchy</h4>

<p> Camp then goes on to quote another confused anti-evolutionist, Michael
Denton, in support of his assertion that common descent does not predict a
nested hierarchy: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> "In the final analysis the hierarchic pattern is nothing like the
straightforward witness for organic evolution that is commonly assumed. There
are facets of the hierarchy which do not flow naturally from any sort of random
undirected evolutionary process. If the hierarchy suggests any model of nature
it is typology and not evolution. How much easier it would be to argue the case
for evolution if all nature's divisions were blurred and indistinct, if the
<i>systema naturalae</i> was largely made up of overlapping classes indicative
of sequence and continuity." (<a href="#Denton1986">Denton 1986</a>, 136-137.)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In evolution, "sequence and continuity" are truly only displayed in the
time dimension. Horizontal slices of time may hint at continuity, especially
between closely related species - but branching and divergence from a common
ancestor predicts nested hierarchies at any given time, not a continuum. Denton
just doesn't understand what common descent is (or didn't at the time he wrote
this passage). Common descent is the hypothesis that all species are strictly
genealogically related. That means that species should be organizable into a
family tree. It is very easy to see that a family tree gives nested hierarchies
at any given single point in time. Someone, like Denton, who doesn't understand
even the most fundamental evolutionary concepts really has no business
criticizing evolutionary theory. If all of nature were "blurred and
indistinct," if the "<i>systema naturalae</i> was largely made up of
overlapping classes," this would not indicate common descent, it would indicate
something like Lamarck's organic progression or the medieval view of the "great
chain of being." Camp has replied to these comments: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Next, Dr. Theobald chides me for quoting "another confused
anti-evolutionist," Michael Denton. As an aside, I find it fascinating that,
according to Dr. Theobald, Denton "doesn't understand even the most fundamental
evolutionary concepts." It is fascinating because one often hears that nothing
in biology makes sense except in light of evolution. And yet, Denton, being
ignorant of the most fundamental evolutionary concepts, managed to earn a Ph.D.
in developmental biology (in addition to an M. D.), to write or co-author over
seventy articles in professional journals, and to work for decades as a
genetics researcher. Apparently knowledge of evolution is irrelevant to a
career in science. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> I am confident that Michael Denton has contributed greatly to scientific
knowledge in his area of expertise. Yet, Camp's logic here is wanting. Someone
can have a successful scientific career, especially in an applied field,
without understanding the theory behind the science they practice. Plenty of
people drive cars and fly in planes who understand not a thing about how cars
and planes work. Most people who consider themselves "computer literate" don't
really understand how computers do their thing at the most basic level (and I
count myself among them). I can program in Basic, Perl, and some C++ and Java -
but that doesn't mean I understand how to make a functional silicon computer
chip. Even silicon chip designers often know extremely little quantum
mechanics, even though electromagnetic theory and quantum mechanics ultimately
explain the behavior of all electronic devices. Likewise, someone can be a good
medical doctor without understanding why the drugs they prescribe work
effectively, and someone can do plenty of good biological research without
understanding evolutionary biology. Nevertheless, nothing in computing makes
sense except in the light of microchip technology, nothing in microchip
technology makes sense except in the light of quantum mechanics, nothing in the
automobile industry makes sense except in the light of mechanics and
thermodynamics, nothing in aviation makes sense except in the light of
aerodynamics, nothing in medicine makes sense except in the light of
biochemistry, and nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of
evolution. </p>

<p> It is not to the benefit of Camp's argument that he uses quotes from
Denton's book, <b>Evolution: A Theory in Crisis</b>. This book is so ridden
with errors, false "facts," illogic, and uninformed dialectical rubbish that it
is hard to understand how Camp could find any use in it. As one of a myriad of
examples, immediately preceding the paragraph quoted by Camp above, Denton
writes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "There is another stringent condition which must be satisfied if a
hierarchic pattern is to result as the end product of an evolutionary process:
<i>no ancestral or transitional forms can be permitted to survive</i>." (<a
href="#Denton1986">Denton 1986</a>, p. 136, emphasis in the original). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> This is obviously false and nicely illustrates the wanton ignorance
concerning basic evolutionary concepts displayed in this book. This passage is,
additionally, directly pertinent to the present discussion of nested
hierarchies. Denton immediately follows the above statement with: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "This can be seen by examining the tree diagram above on page 135. If any
of the ancestors X, Y and Z, or if any of the hypothetical transitional
connecting species stationed on the main branches of the tree, had survived and
had therefore to be included in the classification scheme, the distinctness of
the divisions would be blurred by intermediate or partially inclusive classes
and what remained of the hierarchic pattern would be highly disordered." (<a
href="#Denton1986">Denton 1986</a>, p. 136) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The absurdity of these statements is evident when one includes the
ancestors X, Y, and Z in Denton's nested hierarchy figure. All the ancestors
(including a hypothetical transitional connecting species, <span
class="red-text">W</span>) fit in the existing nested hierarchy just fine,
without blurring the distinctness of divisions or contributing disorder to the
hierarchical pattern. If Denton could not even work out the simple evolutionary
predictions based upon his very own figures and examples, it is no wonder that
he thought that "the hierarchic pattern is nothing like the straightforward
witness for organic evolution that is commonly assumed." </p>

<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Dr. Theobald's disparaging comment notwithstanding, Denton's point about
the nested hierarchy observed in nature has merit. The discreteness or
discontinuity of the groupings does not flow naturally from a random,
undirected evolutionary process. One must explain why the morphological space
between the groups exists, as opposed to the divisions being blurred and
indistinct. The point is not that evolutionists cannot explain it but that it
is something that requires an explanation. </p>
</td>

</blockquote>

<p> If that is the point then it is a moot one for our present discussion. All
natural phenomena require an explanation, scientifically. Is there supposed to
be something problematic about that? In fact, "discreteness or discontinuity of
the groupings" <i>does</i> "flow naturally from a random, undirected
evolutionary process." Extinction is an observable fact, both in the fossil
record and in the present. Extinction is all that is needed to cause
discontinuity (though other processes can also be involved). Extinction is also
largely random and undirected. </p>

<p> Interestingly, it appears that Denton may have finally rectified his
misunderstanding about nested hierarchies and common descent, since in his
latest book he unconditionally assumes the validity of the nested hierarchy,
common descent, and the "tree of life" (<a href="#Denton1998">Denton 1998</a>,
pp. 265-298). For example, in the chapter entitled <i>The Tree of Life</i> from
<b>Nature's Destiny</b>, Denton discusses the phylogeny of several closely
related species (the primates) and directly contradicts his previous
misstatements presented by Camp above: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "In the case of primate DNA, for example, all the sequences in the
hemoglobin gene cluster in man, chimp, gorilla, gibbon, etc., can be
interconverted via single base change steps to form a perfect evolutionary tree
relating the higher primates together in a system that looks as natural as
could be imagined. There is not the slightest indication of any discontinuity."
(<a href="#Denton1998">Denton 1998</a>, p. 277) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> This was written by the same man who scribed: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Each class at a molecular level is unique, isolated and unlinked by
intermediates. Thus, molecules, like fossils, have failed to provide the
elusive intermediates so long sought by evolutionary theory." (<a
href="#Denton1986">Denton 1986</a>, p. 290) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> One wonders how Camp can feel justified in quoting Denton's past confusions
about common descent. Camp has responded to this: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Dr. Theobald apparently misunderstands Denton's point in the quote, as he
claims that Denton subsequently contradicted himself in opining that the
hemoglobin gene cluster in primates was not discontinuous. Just because Denton
believes there is no discontinuity requiring an explanation in that particular
instance does not mean he denies there is discontinuity elsewhere. So Dr.
Theobald's comment ("One wonders how Camp can feel justified in quoting
Denton's past confusions about common descent") is misguided. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Contrary to Camp's later protestations, here Denton is not referring to
primate DNA as an exception - he now sees it as an example of a generality of
life. That is why Denton prefaces this case with "for example." One wonders if
Camp has read Denton's new book. </p>

<h3>Unsupported Theology and Projection</h3>

<p> At this point, Camp leaves science and enters into theological arguments:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The notion that the nested hierarchy of organisms is incompatible with
creation is based, not on science, but on the unprovable theological assumption
that if God created life he would do it in some other way. As biologist Leonard
Brand explains: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> The hierarchical arrangement of life illustrated in Fig. 9.6 has been used
by Futuyma (1983) and others as evidence that life must have evolved. They
believe that if life were created, the characteristics of different organisms
would be arranged chaotically or in a continuum, not in the hierarchy of nested
groups evident in nature. If we think of that concept as a hypothesis, how
could it be tested? Actually, to state how a Creator would do things and then
show that nature is or is not designed that way is an empty argument. Such
conjecture depends on the unlikely assumption that we can decide what the
Creator would be like and how he would function. (Brand, 155.) </p>
</blockquote>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In fact, no theological assumptions or arguments are made at all in the
essay. The "29 Evidences" is not an argument against creation - it is the
scientific argument for common descent, no more, no less. The evidence for
common descent can only be evidence against creation if one believes the two
are mutually incompatible. A belief that Divine creation and common descent are
mutually exclusive alternatives is indeed a theological assumption, and it is
one that Ashby Camp makes, not I. If Camp has independent evidence that a
Creator has created life to result in a nested hierarchical classification, let
him present that evidence. If the hypothesis that a Creator created in this
manner is testable and falsifiable, let Ashby Camp tell us how. Personally, I
agree with Brand when he says that "to state how a Creator would do things and
then show that nature is or is not designed that way is an empty argument. Such
conjecture depends on the unlikely assumption that we can decide what the
Creator would be like and how he would function" (<a href="#Brand1997">Brand
1997</a>, p.155). Camp also concurs, as he says that predictions about how God
would create are "based, not on science, but on the unprovable theological
assumption that if God created life he would do it in some [specific] way." The
creation hypothesis that a Creator created life with nested hierarchies is not
scientific; as Brand and Camp note, it is untestable. It is highly ironic that
Camp has tried to turn a fatal weakness of creationism into a weakness of the
theory of common descent. </p>

<p> Throughout his criticism, indeed in every section, Camp relentlessly
accuses me of making theological assumptions which I do not make. Frankly, I
find this to be highly offensive, since in reality it is Ashby Camp who makes
the theological assumptions and then projects his bias on me. I personally
believe that an omnipotent, omniscient Creator could have created in any manner
that he chose. For a theist, the pertinent question is not "what is an
omnipotent Creator capable of?" but rather "how exactly did/does the Creator
create?". The first question is purely theological, and as such is left
unaddressed in the "29 Evidences"; in contrast, the second question is one that
science can answer (given the assumption of a Creator). </p>

<p> The "29 Evidences" concerns <i>scientific</i> evidence only - that means
<i>only</i> hypotheses which can be tested against hard empirical evidence,
<i>only</i> hypotheses that can be either confirmed or falsified in principle.
Unfortunately, Camp forwards numerous meaningless, untestable "creation
hypotheses" throughout his critique, apparently under the self-deceiving
illusion that they have some relevance to the present issue. However, in the
quoted section above, Camp states outright that conjecture about how a Creator
created is not scientific, because such conjecture cannot be tested and because
we cannot know the Creator's intent in the first place. Thus, every alternative
"creation hypothesis" that Camp proffers is scientifically meaningless by his
own admission. </p>

<p> Camp has written in defense of his unsubstantiated theological accusations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> Dr. Theobald next charges me with wrongful imputation of a theological
assumption. ... </p>

<p> First, everyone realizes that universal common ancestry is compatible with
certain theories of divine creation (e.g., theistic evolution). However, it is
incompatible with the claim that the founding members of various groups were
created separately by God. That claim is a specific case of non-universal
common ancestry. So "29 Evidences for Macroevolution" is an argument against
creation in that sense. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> If Camp is correct, then <i>all</i> scientific theories and conclusions are
arguments against some creation "theory." Amos 4:13 states that God creates the
wind (the Hebrew verb for "create" here, "bara," is the same as that in the
first chapter of Genesis). Does that mean that meteorology is an argument
against Divine creation? Someone who reads Amos "literally" could argue that
God separately creates all winds. Thus, appeals to "highs" and "lows" or "cold
fronts" and "warm fronts" are all arguments against the separate creation of
winds. In fact, by Camp's logic, all scientific theories are arguments against
God's direct Divine intervention in some phenomenon that we observe. If
electromagnetic theory is true, that means that God does not miraculously cause
magnets to stick to refrigerators or cause positively charged things to attract
negatively charged things. Though I disagree, suppose for the sake of argument
that Camp is correct that scientific conclusions are necessarily arguments
against direct Divine action. Just because we conclude something does not mean
that we <i>assumed</i> that conclusion in the premises of our argument. Just
because one could conclude from the "29 Evidences" that God did not separately
create species does not mean that was an assumption of the argument. Camp's
first point, thus, does nothing to support his accusation that I have made
certain theological assumptions (against special creation) in the arguments
presented in the "29 Evidences." </p>

<p> Note, however, that Camp is strictly incorrect to state that common
ancestry is necessarily "incompatible with the claim that the founding members
of various groups were created separately by God." As I pointed out earlier in
the discussion here of <a href="#pred2">Prediction 2</a>, God could have
created all species independently and miraculously, yet gradually - a
theological position compatible with universal common descent. <i>Gradual</i>
Divine direction of evolution is consistent with universal common descent, even
thought there is currently no scientific evidence for such a belief. This
concept has been pointed out before by other evolutionary biologists - see, for
instance, the conclusion of Kathleen Hunt's <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional/"> Transitional
Vertebrate FAQ</a>, in the discussion of possible <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional/part2c.html#
models">consistent models</a>, especially "<a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional/part2c.html#
model5">model 5</a>." So, Camp does not simply assume that Divine creation and
common descent are necessarily mutually exclusive alternatives; Camp also makes
the additional theological assumption that God could not have created species
(founding members and/or others) independently <i>and</i> gradually. In
contrast, no such theological assumptions (or conclusions) are made in the "29
Evidences." </p>

<h3> More Unfamiliarity with the Scientific Method </h3>

<p> Camp continues in defense of his accusations: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Second, if evidence is compatible with separate creation by God
(non-universal common ancestry), it is not probative of the contrary
proposition (universal common ancestry). Since one can judge nested hierarchy
to be incompatible with separate creation by God only if one assumes that God
would not separately create organisms in a nested hierarchy, the inference of
universal common ancestry from the evidence of nested hierarchy contains a
latent theological assumption. Because Dr. Theobald is unaware of this, he
takes great umbrage at what he perceives to be my erroneously attributing the
assumption to him. His pique is unwarranted. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Yes, I am piqued, and it is certainly warranted. Once again, Mr. Camp
persists in accusing me of making a theological assumption which I do not make.
Nowhere in the "29 Evidences" is it stated that "God would not separately
create organisms in a nested hierarchy" or anything similar. Nowhere is it
stated or implied that God would or would not create or do anything in
<i>any</i> manner. Of course God could have created organisms in a nested
hierarchy. It is also possible that little pink fairies created all organisms
in a nested hierarchy. The reason those concepts are left unaddressed is
because there is no scientific evidence for them. If there is scientific
evidence for them, then perhaps Mr. Camp should present it. </p>

<p> Yet again, Camp's sophistry evidences ignorance of the scientific method.
The first sentence in Camp's quote above is false. In science, evidence can be
compatible with a hypothesis and still be "probative of the contrary position"
(for those, like me, who are unfamiliar with the words "<a
href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?probative">probative of</a>" - here
it means "evidence for"). Camp insists that the "evidence is compatible with
separate creation by God," which of course it is, but that is a moot point as
far as science is concerned. Scientific theories are not judged simply by their
compatibility with the evidence and data. All physical evidence and data are
<i>compatible</i> with an infinite number of unscientific "hypotheses." As a
simple extreme example, I could hypothesize that the entire universe was
miraculously created 5 minutes ago, with everything already set in place to
appear as if it were much older (our memories included). Such a hypothesis is
completely compatible with the available evidence and data. Go ahead, prove me
wrong! And there lies the rub - this hypothesis is not scientific because there
is no possible evidence that could stand in contradiction to its predictions.
Any and all evidence is compatible. It is untestable in principle, even though
it is logically consistent with the data - but we since cannot test it, we have
no reason to conclude that it is likely, and thus it is not scientific.
Ironically, Camp himself went to great lengths to make this very point about
special creation and the nested hierarchy. Camp stated: </p>

<p> Obviously Camp agrees that there is no way to prove this theological
assumption wrong. It is not scientific. This is true even though it is
<i>logically consistent with the evidence</i>. The "29 Evidences," however,
concerns not what is simply logically consistent with the data. The "29
Evidences" concerns scientific evidence, testable hypotheses, and scientific
conclusions. Supposedly, <i>that</i> was also the object of Camp's criticism.
Camp began his rebuttal with these words: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> In "29 Evidences for Macroevolution," Dr. Theobald sets forth the evidence
that he believes proves scientifically that all organisms share the same
biological ancestor. In this critique, I argue that his evidence is
insufficient to establish that proposition. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In contrast to his claims, Mr. Camp is clearly preoccupied with
establishing the trivial, unscientific fact that special creation by miraculous
means is logically "compatible" with the evidence. His "Critique" of the
scientific evidence concerns unprovable theological assumptions, not science.
</p>

<p> Camp continues with his original critique: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> It may be that the nested hierarchy of living things simply is a
reflection of divine orderliness. It also may be, as Walter ReMine suggests,
that nested hierarchy is an integral part of a message woven by the Creator
into the patterns of biology. (See, e.g., ReMine, 367-368, 465-467.) The point
is that the hierarchical nature of life can be accommodated by creation theory
as readily as by evolution. Accordingly, "[i]t is not evidence for or against
either theory." (Brand, 155.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Creation theory can, to my knowledge, accommodate any possible outcome and
is therefore untestable, unfalsifiable, and unscientific. If Camp has an
opposing view and has examples of observations that would falsify creation
theory, let him present them. Common descent, on the other hand, cannot
accommodate any outcome; common descent predicts observable nested hierarchies.
If rates of evolution are extremely fast (or extremely slow), nested
hierarchies will be observed only for very recently diverged taxa (or for very
distantly related taxa). Fortunately, we observe a range of evolutionary rates
in different characters and thus observe nested hierarchies at many levels in
biology. It is worth pointing out here that it is in fact possible to have a
"reciprocal" pattern from nested hierarchies. Mathematically, a nested
hierarchy is the result of specific correlations between certain characters of
organisms. When evolutionary rates are fast, the characters become randomly
distributed with respect to one another, and the correlations are weakened.
However, the characters could also be anti-correlated in theory - it is
possible for them to be correlated in the opposite direction from what produces
nested hierarchies, as discussed in <a href="section1.html#pred2">Prediction
2</a>. The observation of such an anti-correlated pattern would be highly
inconsistent with common descent, regardless of evolutionary rates. </p>

<h3>Confusion about Evolutionary Theory</h3>

<p> Camp concludes his criticism of this point with an attack on the very
notion of cladistic classification: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Dr. Theobald's claim that "specially designed objects like buildings,
furniture, cars, etc." cannot be classified in a nested hierarchy requires
elaboration. In terms of mere classification, it is incorrect. Buildings and
vehicles have both been used as examples of nesting (<a
href="#Ridley1993">Ridley 1993</a>, 52-54; Fastovsky and Weishampel, 51-53;
Brand, 165-166). </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp's assertion stems from a misunderstanding, one that is addressed in
detail in the new version of the "29 Evidences" under <a href=
"section1.html#pred2" target="_blank">prediction 2</a>. Some authors have used
more familiar objects for illustrating nested hierarchies; however, these are
only for explanatory purposes and are not meant to be strict analogies. Of
course buildings and cars can be arbitrarily sorted into nested hierarchies.
The point is that they do not form <i>natural</i> nested hierarchies; they do
not meet the mathematical requirements of nested hierarchies. Camp seems not to
understand this point, in spite of the fact that one of his favorite
anti-evolutionists explains it clearly: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Any system of objects can be forcibly classified into a nested hierarchy.
Some systems do not have to be forced, rather they display a nested pattern
with clarity without having to be coerced. Life has such a pattern. There are
no tetrapods that are not based on the vertebrate body plan. There are no
amniotes that are not based on the tetrapod body plan. There are no mammals
that are not also amniotes. These are the familiar examples, and many more can
be given. They are powerful generalizations. Life is like nested Chinese boxes
of subsets within subsets within subsets. Life is comprised of nested
similarities. This significant pattern must be explained." (<a
href="#ReMine1993">ReMine 1993</a>, p. 344) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> And common descent explains it. </p>

<h3>A Classic <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/quotcont.html">Out-of-Context
Quote</a></h3>

<p> Camp concludes this misunderstanding with a quote from a well-known
evolutionary biologist, which only appears to support his point: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> "Any set of objects, whether or not they originated in an
evolutionary process, can be classified hierarchically. Chairs, for
instance, are independently created; they are not generated by an
evolutionary process: but any given list of chairs could be
classified hierarchically, perhaps by dividing them first according
to whether or not they were made of wood, then according to their
colour, by date of manufacture, and so on. The fact that life can
be classified hierarchically is not, in itself, an argument for
evolution." (<a href="#Ridley1985">Ridley 1985</a>, 8.) </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp carefully and quite misleadingly omits the very next sentence: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "The argument for evolution comes from a particular property of the
classificatory hierarchy, the kind of traits that define it." (<a
href="#Ridley1985">Ridley 1985</a>, 8.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Ridley goes on to make a good qualitative argument for the uniqueness of
genealogically generated nested hierarchies, of how life's nested hierarchy is
not "forced." Ridley was not arguing that organisms do not fall into natural
nested hierarchies, as Camp implies. By omitting the additional sentence which
I have provided, the Ridley quote appears to mean something other than it did
in the original context. Thus, this is a classic example of the fallacy of <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/quotcont.html">quoting out of context</a>.
Furthermore, Ridley was of course unaware of the more rigorously defined
mathematical differences between "pseudo"-hierarchies of things like cars,
chairs, or buildings and the real hierarchies of organisms or languages,
because the mathematics for examining cladistic hierarchical structure was
first worked out six years later, in 1991. Outdated science is not an argument
against modern theories. What would Camp think if I were arguing against the
existence of X-rays and, in support of my position, quoted Lord Kelvin when he
said, "X-rays will prove to be a hoax"? </p>

<p> Camp has since <a
href="http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_ac_01.asp#b3">replied</a> to this criticism
of his argument given above: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> I wrote that "[i]n terms of mere classification," the statement was
incorrect. To back up the claim that such specially designed objects can indeed
be classified in a nested hierarchy (regardless of whether they possess genuine
hierarchical traits), I pointed out that they are often used as examples of
nesting. </p>

<p> It is in that context that I quoted Ridley. The point was that "[a]ny set
of objects, whether or not they originated in an evolutionary process, can be
classified hierarchically" (emphasis supplied), not that all sets of objects
possess bona fide hierarchical traits. I omitted Ridley's statement that life
exhibits a genuine hierarchy because it was irrelevant to my point. So Dr.
Theobald has quoted me out of context in accusing me of quoting out of context!
He then builds on his confusion in suggesting that I intentionally sought to
mislead people ("Camp carefully and quite misleadingly omits the very next
sentence"). </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote> 

<p> First, I never suggested that Camp intentionally sought to mislead people.
I <i>did</i> claim that Camp "carefully" omitted an important part of Ridley's
statements, and Camp has admitted to that. I also claimed that omitting that
sentence is misleading, which it is. It makes it appear as if Ridley meant
something different from what he intended. Whether Camp <i>intentionally</i>
wrote that line to mislead people is something only Camp himself can know.
Second, I did not quote Camp out of context. I included Camp's sentence "In
terms of mere classification, it is incorrect." Third, it is now quite clear
that Camp understands that there are important differences between artificial
and "<i>bona fide</i>" nested hierarchies: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> ... I was not quoting Ridley to deny there is a difference between
artificial and genuine hierarchies but only to support my contention that
specially designed objects can be classified in a nested hierarchy ... </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> So what? That is a very trivial point; someone could artificially classify
pennies as "square rabbits", too. It is of course valid to state that pennies
cannot be classified as squares or rabbits, because pennies obviously do not
satisfy the requirements of geometrical squares or biological animals. The
comment that Camp was contesting was the first line of the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> Real world examples that cannot be classified as [nested hierarchies] are
elementary particles (which are described by quantum chromodynamics), the
elements (whose organization is described by quantum mechanics and illustrated
by the periodic table), the planets in our Solar System, books in a library, or
specially designed objects like buildings, furniture, cars, etc. That certain
organisms merely are similar to each other is not enough to support
macroevolution; the nested classification pattern that satisfies the
macroevolutionary process is very specific. ... Most existing species can be
organized rather easily in a nested hierarchical classification. This is
evident in the use of the Linnaean classification scheme. ... As a specific
example (see Figure 1), plants can be classified as vascular and nonvascular
(i.e. they have or lack xylem and phloem). Nested within the vascular group,
there are two divisions, seed and non-seed plants. Further nested within the
seed plants are two more groups, the angiosperms (which have enclosed,
protected seeds) and the gymnosperms (having non-enclosed seeds). Within the
angiosperm group are the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. ... Few species
are ever found that combine characteristics of different nested groupings. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Again, Mr. Camp has taken a quote out of context and used the resulting
ambiguity to infuse it with a meaning contrary to its intent. Specifically,
this is a <a href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/accent.htm">fallacy
of accent</a>. When someone says "X cannot do Y," it does not necessarily mean
that "it is impossible for X to do Y" - it can also mean that "it is
impermissible for X to do Y" (see the definition of <a
href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?can"><i>can</i></a> in the
Merriam-Webster dictionary). It is of course clear from the context in the
above passage that <i>can</i> was used in the second sense, since the reasons
why some objects have genuine hierarchical characteristics and others do not
was explained. </p>

<p> In this light, it is quite curious that Camp made such a fuss over the fact
that someone could artificially categorize certain non-hierarchical things in
nested hierarchies. That was not the point made in <i>Prediction 2</i> of the
"29 Evidences" - so why include the Ridley quote to begin with? The point was
simply that species form natural nested hierarchies, while chairs, books, the
planets, the elements, and fundamental particles do not - and Camp evidently
agrees. Was it a mistake to expect that Camp's arguments and supporting quotes
were actually intended to be directed against the evidence for common descent?
That is of course what I assumed when I read the Ridley quote, and I suspect
many other readers made the same assumption (after all, Camp stated that was
the purpose of his "Critique.") </p>

<h2><a id="pred3" name="pred3"></a>Prediction 3: Convergence of independent
phylogenies</h2>

<h3>More Misrepresentation of Evolutionary Theory</h3>

<p> Common descent predicts that independent determinations of phylogenetic
histories should be similar. Once again, Camp denies that this is a prediction
of common descent. However, this time, his basis for denial is that he thinks
this prediction has been falsified, and since scientists do not toss out common
descent, this must not be a prediction of common descent. Camp's error lies in
his belief that this prediction has been falsified. Camp says: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The important point is that it is not a prediction of the hypothesis of
common ancestry that phylogenies constructed from comparisons of biological
molecules will match phylogenies constructed from comparisons of morphology.
This is obvious from the fact molecular and morphological phylogenies often are
inconsistent, and yet the hypothesis of common descent is not considered
falsified. The discordant data are simply accommodated by the theory. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp is correct that often independently determined phylogenies are not
exactly the same (i.e. they are incongruent). But in science, independent
measurements of some value (such as a physical constant like the charge of the
electron, the mass of the proton, or the speed of light) are never exact. There
always exists some error in the measurement, and all independent measurements
are incongruent to some extent. Of course, the true value of something is never
known for certain - all we have are measurements that we hope approximate the
true value. Scientifically, then, the important relevant questions are "When
comparing two measurements, how much of a discrepancy does it take to be a
problem?" and "How close must they be to be a strong confirmation?" Scientists
answer these questions with probability and statistics. This issue is
specifically addressed in the revised version of the "29 Evidences" under <a
href= "section1.html#pred3" target="_blank">prediction 3</a>. The upshot is
that the degree to which even the most incongruent trees match is
extraordinary. Penny and Hendy have done a detailed statistical analysis of the
significance of similar phylogenetic trees, and here is their conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Biologists seem to seek the 'The One Tree' and appear not to be satisfied
by a range of options. However, there is no logical difficulty in having a
range of trees. There are 34,459,425 possible trees for 11 taxa (<a
href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>), and to reduce this to the order
of 10-50 trees is analogous to an accuracy of measurement of approximately one
part in 10<sup>6</sup>." (<a href="#PennyHendy1986">Penny and Hendy 1986</a>,
p. 414) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> For a more realistic universal phylogenetic tree with dozens of taxa
including all known phyla, the accuracy is orders of magnitude smaller
(better). </p>

<p> So Camp is incorrect on two counts. First, common descent does indeed
predict that independently determined trees should be similar - if there really
is a true genealogical tree of species, how could this not be the prediction?
This is exactly why all the scientists that Camp quotes are concerned about
incongruent trees. Second, the trees <i>are</i> stunningly similar - even the
most incongruent ones. Incongruent trees are a "problem" in the sense that we
biologists wish to attain perfection in our science, and incongruent trees are
imperfect. Even so, the differences are just much too minor to falsify common
descent; to the contrary, they confirm this prediction of common descent to a
much higher degree than is found in any other scientific discipline. </p>

<p> Camp has offered a defense of his erroneous views: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> Dr. Theobald misses the point in arguing that even the most incongruent
phylogenies match to an extraordinary degree. Since his evidence is the alleged
fulfillment of a falsifiable prediction, the issue is not the degree to which
phylogenies match but the degree to which the bare hypothesis of common
ancestry demands that they match. Without some constraint on the operation of
processes that work against congruity, which constraint the hypothesis does not
provide, nonmatching phylogenies are compatible with the hypothesis. There is
no falsifiable prediction of congruity. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Perhaps Camp did not read my reply, since "the degree to which the bare
hypothesis of common ancestry demands that [independently derived phylogenies]
match" is clearly stated: <b>they must match with statistical significance</b>
(for more discussion see <a href="section1.html#pred3">Prediction 3</a>). This
requirement has been stated, tested, and fulfilled in the primary scientific
literature on several occasions (<a href="#Baldauf_etal2000">Baldauf et al.
2000</a>; <a href="#PennyHendy1986">Penny and Hendy 1986</a>; <a
href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>; <a href="#Penny_etal1991">Penny
et al. 1991</a>). Since it was possible, indeed highly probable, for
phylogenies to match without statistical significance or to <i>mis</i>-match
with statistical significance, the prediction of congruity is easily
falsifiable if common descent is false. Camp is clearly wrong on this account,
and he has failed to even address the issue. </p>

<h3>A Self-contradiction - the <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/incon.htm">Fallacy of
Inconsistency</a></h3>

<p> Unfortunately, Camp's argument is fundamentally flawed at a much deeper
level. Camp contradicts himself; in his eagerness to "disprove" common descent,
Camp simultaneously argues for two opposing views. Camp states: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> ... molecular and morphological phylogenies often are inconsistent, and yet
the hypothesis of common descent is not considered falsified. The discordant
data are simply accommodated by the theory. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> and follows with this a few paragraphs later: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The availability of such ad hoc adjustments for resolving incongruities
makes the claim of falsifiability an illusion. Any result can be accommodated
by the theory by revising one or more of the underlying assumptions. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Why is there any discordant data if any result is changed at will with
<i>ad hoc</i> revising of the assumptions? These statements are contradictory,
and obviously both cannot be true. In fact, both are false. Camp has objected
to my analysis here: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> ... there is no contradiction in saying that inconsistent molecular and
morphological phylogenies are discordant data and saying that such
inconsistencies can be accommodated by ad hoc adjustments. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> However, that was not Camp's original claim. He was claiming that
inconsistent phylogenies exist <i>in the scientific literature</i> and that
incongruities are generally resolved in practice by <i>ad hoc</i> adjustments
("the obvious point that assumptions are adjusted to accommodate discordant
data"). That claim is obviously self-contradictory, since phylogenies in the
scientific literature cannot be both inconsistent and congruent simultaneously.
Note that, if this is <i>not</i> really what Camp meant, then he has no valid
point. Just because inconsistencies <i>can</i> be accommodated, in principle,
by invoking <i>ad hoc</i> arguments does not mean that scientists actually do
so or that this kind of 'assumption-adjusting' is considered fair game. In
principle, all possible conflicting observations in any scientific discipline
can be made consistent with any theory by invoking <i>ad hoc</i> arguments
(formally known as the Duhem-Quine thesis). Therefore, if Camp actually meant
this, it is an argument that is not specific to evolutionary biology, since it
can be applied to all of science. If Camp is attacking all of science, he
should clearly admit as much and not pretend that his arguments are specific
for evolutionary biology. But, as detailed below, Camp is incorrect on both
counts regardless. First, though strictly incongruent phylogenies exist, the
vast majority of phylogenies are consistent <i>within error</i> and with
statistical significance - which is what counts in science. Second, <i>ad
hoc</i> adjustments are not used liberally - their use is severely constrained
by gradualism and by what has been empirically observed. Camp ignores both of
these facts. </p>

<h3>A Malign Accusation Based on Misunderstanding of the Scientific Method and
Evolutionary Methods</h3>

<p> Biologists cannot "adjust the assumptions" to give any desired result. Camp
is making the slanderous claim that biologists unethically manipulate their
data to result in a predetermined outcome. Here's a test: if Camp's malign
accusation is true, he should be able to adjust the assumptions of a
phylogenetic analysis to result in a tree of my choice. Using any molecular
data of his choice, Camp should be able to generate a phylogenetic tree with a
standard tree-building program (such as PAUP, Phylip, MacClade, etc.) that
places chimps closest to fish, humans closest to birds, cows closest to
insects, and bacteria closest to marsupials, specifically as shown below: </p>

<pre>

      \/  /
       \ /
        V
        |
</pre>

<p> The truth is that Camp will be unable to meet this challenge. All
scientists, including biologists, must deal with this annoying thing called
"reality." Real data cannot be arbitrarily fit to any model with equal success.
Even more importantly, scientists do not uncritically accept <i>ad hoc</i>
assumptions. Valid assumptions must be reasonable and independently testable.
</p>

<p> Mr. Camp has addressed this challenge: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> For making the obvious point that assumptions are adjusted to accommodate
discordant data, Dr. Theobald falsely accuses me of slandering biologists with
the charge that they "<i>unethically manipulate their data</i> to result in a
predetermined outcome" (emphasis supplied [by Camp]). </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> This is no false accusation. Unjustified, <i>ad hoc</i> manipulation of
data is unethical behavior in science, especially if it is used to make data
appear to agree with a predetermined outcome, as Camp claims. If Camp believes
biologists do this, he is obligated to provide an example of where researchers
have intentionally used <i>ad hoc</i>, scientifically unjustified revisions of
the underlying assumptions of a phylogenetic analysis in order to make
discordant phylogenies appear more congruent. Since Camp is claiming that this
is a <i>general</i> feature of evolutionary phylogenetic analysis (and not just
a rare, exceptional behavior), he should be able to provide <i>many</i>
examples from throughout the modern peer-reviewed scientific literature
(preferably from articles less than 5-10 years old). In the event that Camp is
unable to do this, I strongly suggest that he retract his slander. </p>

<h3> <a href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/twowrong.html">Two Wrongs make a

<p> Camp, however, has attempted to justify his accusations: </p>

<p> Does it matter? Does Camp believe his statements are justified simply
because other people have done the same? Camp's question is an overt use of the

</blockquote>

<p> Whether anyone accused them of slander is beside the point. However, Camp
claimed <i>more</i> than the above. Camp didn't just claim that these <i>ad

<i>are</i> invoked by biologists to manipulate the outcomes of their analyses.
Camp's question misses the point altogether. </p>

<p> In any event, Schwabe and Warr wrote those comments over fifteen years ago.
Mountains of molecular data have been acquired and analyzed since then, and new
techniques and technologies have been developed. It is possible that Schwabe
and Warr's statements were applicable at the time - but, regardless, they are
certainly inapplicable now (see the <a href="#schwabe_warr">discussion of
Schwabe and Warr's article</a> below). </p>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In other words, Camp admits he is unable to meet the specified challenge.
By doing so, Camp concedes that it is untrue that "Any result can be
accommodated by the theory by revising one or more of the underlying
assumptions". As clearly evidenced by the exchange above, <i>that</i> was the
point being discussed here - not that any "phylogeny would be compatible with
the bare hypothesis of universal common ancestry." This last point, which Camp
urges is <i>the</i> point, is silly. It is of course true in an extremely
trivial sense - <i>if</i> we ignore all other relevant data and the
requirements of common descent on our planet. But we cannot ignore this data,
since the only way we can test the theory of common descent is with real
evidence from our world. All individual pieces of data, in isolation, are
consistent with any theory. However, theories are tested with specific data
from specific cases which are compared with each other - a basic scientific
point that is completely lost on Camp. We test common descent in the real
world, on this planet, with the organisms that we observe here - not with some
fictional concoction from Camp's head. It is analogously true that a specified
value of 6x10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup> for the
universal Newtonian constant of gravitation would be compatible with the bare
hypothesis of universal gravitation. But the true value is (approximately)
6.673x10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>, and the
specified hypothetical value is massively inconsistent with all current
measurements which have approximated this universal constant. Again, we test
universal theories with specific data from independent measurements in the real
world - a fundamental aspect of the scientific method with which Camp is
clearly unacquainted. </p>

<p> The fact remains that the specified phylogeny given above is massively
inconsistent with the morphological phylogeny and all known molecular
phylogenies, and the specified phylogeny cannot be constructed with any known
molecular sequences using current phylogenetic reconstruction programs,
regardless of how the assumptions are adjusted. This is exactly what one would
predict if common descent is true, and this is precisely why common descent is
a falsifiable hypothesis. My specified tree <i>could</i> be compatible with
common descent in a different world - but in <i>our</i> world it is
incompatible with common descent, and the real data do not support such a
fictitious phylogeny. </p>

<p> In discussing incongruent phylogenies, Camp uses a favorite quote of
"scientific" creationists by Christian Schwabe and Gregory Warr (Camp gets
Schwabe's name wrong - it is not "Christopher"): </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> Two years earlier, Schwabe and Gregory Warr were equally blunt in their
criticism of molecular phylogenies. They saw the field of molecular evolution
as being mired in subjectivity driven by an <i>a priori</i> commitment to
universal common ancestry. They wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> We believe that it is possible to draw up a list of basic rules that
underlie existing molecular evolutionary models: </p>

<ol>

<li>All theories are monophyletic, meaning that they all start with the
<i>Urgene</i> and the <i>Urzelle</i> which have given rise to all proteins and
all species, respectively.</li>

<li>Complexity evolves mainly through duplications and mutations in structural
and control genes.</li>

<li>Genes can mutate or remain stable, migrate laterally from species to
species, spread through a population by mechanisms whose operation is not fully
understood, evolve coordinately, splice, stay silent, and exist as
pseudogenes.</li>

<li>Ad hoc arguments can be invented (such as insect vectors or viruses) that
can transport a gene into places where no monophyletic logic could otherwise
explain its presence.</li>

</ol>

<p> This liberal spread of rules, each of which can be observed in use by
scientists, does not just sound facetious but also, in our opinion, robs
monophyletic evolution of its vulnerability to disproof, and thereby its
entitlement to the status of a scientific theory. The absolute, explicit and
implicit, adherence to all the monophyletic principle and consequently the
decision to interpret all observations in the light of this principle is the
major cause of incongruities as well as for the invention of all the genetic
sidestepping rules cited above. (Schwabe and Warr, 467.) </p> </blockquote>

<p> Camp quotes Schwabe and Warr without providing any hard evidence to back up
their claims. Schwabe and Warr wrote these statements nearly twenty years ago,
when we had only a tiny fraction of the presently known molecular sequences (in
1984 we had less than three-hundredths of one percent of the number of
sequences <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/genbankstats.html
">known in 2001</a>). Frankly, Schwabe and Warr were wrong. Just because a
scientist makes an argument does not mean that his argument is correct. Just
because it is published does not make it correct. Publication in peer-reviewed
journals is only the first step of scientific peer-review. Just because a
scientific argument might have been correct 18 years ago does not mean it is
correct today. Schwabe and Warr stated their case, but the evidence acquired
since has not supported their views. Science is weighed and measured with hard
evidence and specific examples. Does Camp give any to support Schwabe and
Warr's claims? No. </p>

<p> Let's examine Schwabe and Warr's claims. First, it is untrue that "All
theories are monophyletic ...". The hypothesis of the universal common ancestry
of species is not the same as universal common ancestry of proteins and/or
genes. In fact, it is virtually certain that genes and proteins have arisen
independently many times throughout evolutionary history. We know of many
mechanisms for creating proteins and genes <i>de novo</i>. For instance, we
have observed the evolution of a completely novel protein in bacteria by
mutations which translate a gene in a new reading frame. The resulting protein
has no similarity to the initial one (<a href="#Ohno1984">Ohno 1984</a>).
Second, increases in complexity due to gene duplications and mutations have
been observed in the wild and the lab (<a href="#Copley2000">Copley 2000</a>;
<a href="#Futuyma1998">Futuyma 1998</a>, p. 274; <a

and Lange 1994</a>; <a href="#Salamone_etal2002">Salamone et al. 2002</a>). For
example, <i>Flavobacterium</i> recently evolved the ability to metabolize the
exclusively man-made chemical nylon as its sole carbon source. This ability
required the duplication and mutation of genes for three different enzymes (<a
href="#Negoro_etal1994">Negoro et al. 1994</a>; <a href="#Ohno1984">Ohno
1984</a>; <a href="#Okada_etal1983">Okada et al. 1983</a>). These results have
also been duplicated in the lab (<a href="#Prijambada_etal1995">Prijambada et
al. 1995</a>). Some of these studies have demonstrated that new enzymes have
evolved with increased specificity for their substrates (<a
href="#Salamone_etal2002">Salamone et al. 2002</a>). This is not <i>ad hoc</i>
nor is it "liberal" - it is factual. Third, we observe stochastic (random)
mutation of genes regularly (which means we expect that often, simply due to
chance, genes will not mutate), we regularly observe lateral transfer (<a
href="#Dowson_etal1994">Dowson et al. 1994</a>; <a

spread through populations (yes, even when mechanisms are not well understood)
(<a href="#Raymond_etal2001">Raymond et al. 2001</a>), we find silent genes, we
find splicing genes (<a href="#HastingsKrainer2001">Hastings and Krainer
2001</a>), we find pseudogenes (<a href="#Mighell_etal2000">Mighell et al.

href="#Strachan_etal1985">Strachan et al. 1985</a>; <a
href="#LambHelmi1982">Lamb and Helmi 1982</a>). Again, none of this is
<i>ad hoc</i>, nor is it "liberal" it is factual. Fourth, countless times we
have observed viral vectors insert genes where monophyly could not explain it
(<a href="#HindmarshLeis1999">Hindmarsh and Leis 1999</a>; <a
href="#UrnovitzMurphy1996">Urnovitz and Murphy 1996</a>). Neither is this <i>ad
hoc</i> - it is factual. Finally, Schwabe and Warr state that biologists
resorted to "the invention of all the genetic sidestepping rules cited above"
in order to explain their observations. That is preposterous. Biologists did
not "invent" these mechanisms; they were empirically discovered both in the
wild and in the lab over the past few decades. Now, over fifteen years after
Schwabe and Warr wrote these words, we have delineated these various processes
in considerable detail, both mechanistically and structurally at the molecular
level. </p>

<p> Camp has replied: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> The bare hypothesis of universal common ancestry places no constraint on
the operation of these processes. It therefore makes no falsifiable prediction
that molecular phylogenies will converge on the standard morphological
phylogeny. So, contrary to Dr. Theobald's assertion, it is not that I believe
the prediction has been falsified. Rather, I believe the claim of
falsifiability is an illusion. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> As stated many times over in this reply and in the "29 Evidences,"
gradualism severely constrains the operation of all evolutionary processes. If
we invoke any of the processes that Schwabe and Warr are concerned about, they
must be used in a manner consistent with what has been observed. We cannot use
any and all rates of mutation - for example, some rates are too high to be
reasonable (e.g. greater than an average of 10<sup>-6</sup> per base per
generation in mammals). Contrary to Schwabe and Warr's overstated claims, it is
not <i>ad hoc</i> to explain observations with mechanisms that have been
observed. It is not a "liberal spread of rules." It <i>is</i>, however, good
scientific practice. In many, probably most, cases these proposed mechanisms
are independently testable. For example, horizontal gene transfer by viral
insertion into a host genome leaves easily recognizable tell-tale signs in the
sequences surrounding the inserted gene. If a gene has been inserted by a viral
vector, these tell-tale sequences should be there. In fact, it would be
unjustified and <i>ad hoc</i> to be aware of all these observations over the
past 50 years of various genetic mechanisms and to argue that they were not
important in the past 3.5 billion years of evolutionary history. Camp, Schwabe,
and Warr appear to be miffed that biology is complex, and that there are many
ways for genes to be transmitted between organisms besides linear inheritance
between generations. But this is real science, the real world, real biology -
the real world is not simple, and biology is the most complex of sciences.
Biological data demand complex explanations. Just because a scientific
explanation is complex does not mean it is unfalsifiable. Very clear,
unambiguous ways exist to falsify common descent, and demonstrating pervasive,
highly incongruent phylogenies is one of them, in spite of these various
mechanisms which could be used to explain relatively minor incongruencies. For
more explanation, refer to <a href= "section1.html#pred3"
target="_blank">prediction 3</a>. </p>

<p> Furthermore, Schwabe and Warr grossly overstate the importance of known
incongruent phylogenies. As addressed in <a href= "section1.html#pred3"
target="_blank">prediction 3</a> and as illustrated by the Penny and Hendy
comment above, incongruent data in phylogenetic analyses are much less
problematic than incongruent data in other scientific fields, such as particle
physics and gravity. As stated above, in reality the known incongruent trees
are a "problem" only in the sense that we biologists wish to attain perfection
in our science, and incongruent trees are imperfect. </p>

<p> Camp's fallacious <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/authorit.html">appeal to authority</a>
falls apart upon even cursory inspection. It is yet another example of using
outdated (and marginal) science in an attempt to bolster a flawed argument.
</p>

<h3>Insufficient Knowledge of Basic Molecular Biology and Genetics</h3>

<p> Camp even doubts that correspondence between molecular and morphological
phylogenies is evidence for common descent: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Even if a morphological phylogeny was matched closely by multiple
molecular phylogenies, that would not prove that the groups in question
descended from a common ancestor. The molecular differences could be linked to
the morphological differences for some other reason. </p>
</td>
</tr>

</blockquote>

<p> Though Camp's point is valid, it already has been addressed extensively in
<a href="section1.html#pred3" target="_blank">Prediction 3</a>, <a
href="section4.html#pred17">Prediction 17</a>, and <a href=
"section4.html#pred18" target="_blank">Prediction 18</a> of the "29 Evidences."
It is relatively simple to find genes or parts of genes (the molecular
evidence) that are not functionally linked to morphology. </p>

<h3>Confusion about Evolutionary Theory</h3>

<p> Camp goes on to quote Hunter concerning this point: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Hunter illustrates the point this way: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> Penny obtained his trees by culling those that were most parsimonious -
that is, he selected the trees that showed the least amount of evolutionary
change to represent the history of life. The first problem is that Penny's
method works perfectly fine on things we know did not come about via Darwinian
evolution. For example, Penny's method would also claim that automobiles
evolved from one another. </p>
</blockquote>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> As pointed out above, Hunter is incorrect. Hunter makes the bold claim that
"Penny's method would also claim that automobiles evolved from one another" in
the absence of any evidence to support that claim. Automobiles might give a
most parsimonious tree (though this is not assured), but even if they do, the
resulting tree will be bunk. It will not satisfy the mathematical requirements
for nested hierarchies, and the reasons are explained in <a href=
"section1.html#pred2" target="_blank">Prediction 2</a>. If Camp and Hunter
think otherwise, they should determine a phylogenetic tree of cars, using
standard phylogenetic programs, that has statistically significant high values
of cladistic hierarchical structure. To really drive the point home, they could
derive two trees independently, and then show that they match with statistical
significance. If they are correct, they could easily prove their point - but in
reality they will be unable to do so. </p>

<h3><a id="cartalk" name="cartalk"></a>A <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/falsean.htm">False
Analogy</a></h3>

<p> Camp continues with Hunter's quote: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Consider a group of vehicles, beginning with a small economy car and
increasing in size to larger cars and to minivans and large-sized vans. One
could quantify several aspects of the vehicle designs, such as tire size,
steering mechanism, engine size, number of seats and so forth. Presupposing the
evolutionary paradigm and searching for parsimonious relationships, we would
find that most of the design measures suggest the same relationship. The
smaller vehicles have smaller tires, manual steering, smaller engines, and
fewer seats. The larger vehicles have larger tires, power steering, larger
engines, and more seats. In other words, the groupings suggested by the
different design measures (tire size, steering mechanism, engine size, etc.)
tend to be similar. But of course, the family of automobiles did not evolve
from one another via random mutations. The groupings of the design measures are
a natural result of engineering and have nothing to do with Darwinian
evolution. How then can Penny's results provide "strong support" for evolution?
(Hunter, 40.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Hunter's example is erroneous for another reason - he has obviously chosen
characters that are not independent. This is a big "no-no" in cladistic
analysis, and it is a rudimentary issue that is addressed early on in any
introductory text on phylogenetic analysis. When using characters of organisms
in a cladistic analysis, biologists attempt to use characters that are as
functionally and developmentally independent of one another as possible. For
instance, the size of an animal is only one character. Of course larger animals
will in general have larger bodies, larger legs, and larger heads, just as in
Hunter's example larger cars have larger tires, larger engines, etc. To be
valid, "largeness" cannot be counted more than once. The very obvious solution,
which is regularly used by biologists, is to measure the <i>relative</i> sizes
of different characters. For instance, having a femur/tibia ratio of 3 is a
different character from having a femur/tibia ratio of 1/2, regardless of the
overall length of the bones. Biologists know that they must normalize for size,
and instead they concentrate on structural details. Hunter's example is a
classic straw man. </p>

<p> Penny's analysis (<a href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>) used
five genes, four of which are functionally independent; thus, the result that
trees made from several different independent genes match with statistical
significance is indeed extremely strong support for common descent. For
Hunter's analogy to be valid, he would have to claim that phylogenetic trees
made only with cars' steering wheels will match phylogenetic trees made only
with cars' tires and trees made only with cars' headlights and trees made only
with cars' engines and trees made only with cars' transmissions. Obviously,
such a claim would be false, since cars with similar tires (e.g. similar
width/diameter ratio, manufacturers, tread, color, materials, etc.) do not
generally also have similar engines (e.g. similar manufacturer, injection
systems, cylinder arrangement, orientation, etc.), or headlights (e.g. similar
shape, brightness, manufacturer, bulb type, position, number, etc.), or
transmissions, or steering wheels. </p>

<p> Even if Hunter's analysis used independent characters, it would still be
erroneous for another basic reason: cars do not self-replicate. Hence, we
cannot validly infer a genealogical relationship between cars. However that
possibility exists with organisms, which <i>do</i> self-replicate. </p>

<p> Thus, Hunter's <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/falsean.htm">analogy is false</a>
for multiple reasons. Hunter's example of how cars' characters can be analyzed
to infer a phylogeny is quite different from how real organisms' characters are
analyzed by biologists when inferring a phylogeny. </p>

<a id="similarity" name="similarity"></a><h3>Insufficient Knowledge of Basic
Molecular Biology and Genetics</h3>

<p> Camp believes that "it would not be surprising from a creation perspective
to find that biochemical similarities increase in relation to other
similarities of the creatures being compared," and he quotes anti-evolutionists
Duane Gish and Leonard Brand in support: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> "We know, for instance, that man is more similar to a chimpanzee than he is
to a bat; that he is more similar to either a chimpanzee or a bat than he is to
a crocodile or a flea. Man, chimpanzee, and the bat are mammals. The
creationist would expect, therefore, that his protein, DNA, and RNA molecules,
those macromolecules that are among the most important molecules in metabolism,
would be more similar to those of the chimpanzee and to those of the bat than
to those of the crocodile or the flea." (Gish, 277-278.) </p>

<p> "Anatomy is not independent of biochemistry. Creatures similar anatomically
are likely to be similar physiologically. Those similar in physiology are, in
general, likely to be similar in biochemistry, whether they evolved or were
designed." (Brand, 156.) </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Both are wrong. There is no known biological reason, besides common
descent, to suppose that similar morphologies must have similar biochemistry.
At first, the statements made by Gish and Brand may seem obviously correct to
the layperson, but all of molecular biology refutes this "common sense"
correlation. In general, similar DNA and biochemistry give similar morphology
and function, but the converse is not true - similar morphology and function is
not necessarily the result of similar DNA or biochemistry. The reason is easily
understood once explained; many very different DNA sequences or biochemical
structures can result in the same functions and the same morphologies. As a
very close analogy, consider computer programs. Netscape works essentially the
same on a Macintosh, an IBM, or a Unix machine, but the binary code for each
program is quite different. Computer programs that perform the same functions
can be written in most any computer language - Basic, Fortran, C, C++, Java,
Pascal, etc. and identical programs can be compiled into binary code many
different ways. Furthermore, even using the same computer language, there are
many different ways to write any specific computer program. In the end, there
is no reason to suspect that similar computer programs are written with similar
code, based solely on the function of the program. This is the reason why
software companies keep their source code secret, but don't care that
competitors can use the program - it is essentially impossible to deduce the
program code from the function and operation of the software. The same
conclusion applies to biological organisms, for very similar reasons. </p>

<p> Leonard Brand is evidently ignorant of this basic conclusion from modern
genetics and molecular biology, since Camp quotes him stating: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> "An alternate, interventionist hypothesis is that the cytochrome <i>c</i>
molecules in various groups of organisms are different (and always have been
different) for functional reasons. ...If we do not base our conclusions on the
<i>a priori</i> assumption of megaevolution, all the data really tell us is
that the organisms fall into nested groups without any indication of
intermediates or overlapping of groups, and without indicating
ancestor/descendant relationships. The evidence can be explained by a separate
creation for each group of organisms represented in the cytochrome <i>c</i>
data." (Brand, 158-159.) </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Brand's entire argument is predicated upon his first sentence - "An
alternate, interventionist hypothesis is that the cytochrome <i>c</i> molecules
in various groups of organisms are different ... for functional reasons."
Brand's hypothesis is uncharacteristically testable, which is fortunate. If we
can demonstrate that cytochrome <i>c</i> molecules from different organisms are
not different for functional reasons, then his argument is moot. In fact, it
has been shown that the human cytochrome <i>c</i> protein works just fine in
yeast (a unicellular organism) that lacks its own native cytochrome <i>c</i>
gene, even though yeast cytochrome <i>c</i> differs from human cytochrome
<i>c</i> over 40% of the protein. Even the cytochrome <i>c</i> genes from tuna,
pigeon, horse, <i>Drosophila</i> fly, and rat all function well in yeast that
lack their own native yeast cytochrome <i>c</i>. Furthermore, extensive genetic
analysis of cytochrome <i>c</i> has demonstrated that the majority of the
protein sequence is unnecessary for its function <i>in vivo</i> (a point
covered in detail in the original version of the "29 Evidences" under <a href=
"section4.html#pred17" target="_blank">Prediction 17</a>). Obviously, Brand's
"alternate hypothesis" is false, as is the rest of his argument. The cytochrome
<i>c</i> gene is not exceptional in this regard - similar results have been
found for all other ubiquitous genes tested. Biochemically, the reason for this
observation is easily explained. Most of the sequence of a protein, like
cytochrome <i>c</i>, is used for structural elements. As long as these
structural parts of the protein fold into the same structure, the exact
sequence is inconsequential. From X-ray crystallographic studies of the atomic
structures of proteins, we know that many of the amino acids in any protein are
not even used for structure and that many different amino acid sequences can
fold into the same structure. Thus, since structure determines function, we
fully expect that proteins with very different sequences will give the same
function, and that is exactly what we observe. Accordingly, as explained
earlier and contrary to Camp's argument, there is no reason to assume (aside
from common descent) that similar morphologies and functions are due to similar
molecular elements. </p>

<h3>Another <a href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/redherrf.html">Red
Herring</a>: Insufficient Knowledge of "Neo-Darwinism"</h3>

<p> Camp finds yet another "problem" with the cytochrome <i>c</i> data and its
implications for common descent: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The cytochrome <i>c</i> data on which Dr. Theobald relies present some
puzzles from a neo-Darwinian perspective. First, the cytochromes of all the
higher organisms (yeasts, plants, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds,
and mammals) exhibit an almost equal degree of sequence divergence from the
cytochrome of the bacteria <i>Rhodospirillum.</i> In other words, the degree of
divergence does not increase as one moves up the scale of evolution but remains
essentially uniform. The cytochrome <i>c</i> of other organisms, such as yeast
and the silkworm moth, likewise exhibits an essentially uniform degree of
divergence from organisms as dissimilar as wheat, lamprey, tuna, bullfrog,
snapping turtle, penguin, kangaroo, horse, and human. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Though mechanisms of adaptive evolutionary change are not addressed in the
"29 Evidences," Camp inserts a <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/redherrf.html">red herring</a> here and
shifts the subject by questioning the efficacy of "neo-Darwinism" to explain
the degree of divergence observed in the cytochrome <i>c</i> sequences of
various organisms. Camp's line of argumentation regarding rates is off the
point. Common descent states nothing specifically about evolutionary rates,
whether they must be fast, slow, variable, or constant, and the most commonly
used phylogenetic methods make no rate assumptions. Common descent is, in
general, consistent with a large range of evolutionary rates, as long as the
rates satisfy the requirement of gradualism. Explaining rates is the specific
realm of genetic mechanisms, such as genetic drift, neutral theory, natural
selection, gene flow, sexual selection, mutation, etc. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, Camp's discussion of cytochrome <i>c</i> rates is flawed and
is not based in a working knowledge of the fundamentals of modern genetics or
molecular biology. One of the main consequences of the functional redundancy of
protein sequences (discussed in preceding paragraphs) is "neutral" evolution.
The neutral theory describes the genetic behavior of mutations in protein and
DNA sequences that have no, or very slight, selective effects. As mentioned
above, about 70% of the cytochrome <i>c</i> protein is redundant. Changes in
this 70% have virtually no effect upon function, and thus no selective effect -
this 70% is selectively "neutral." One of the major predictions of the neutral
theory is that the overall rate of evolution in neutral regions (where
"evolution" means change in sequence) will be equal to the background rate of
mutation. Mutations are largely due to factors that are relatively constant
between different organisms, such as chemical and physical events (such as the
spontaneous breaking or formation of bonds in DNA) and "errors" in the
ubiquitous DNA repair machinery. Thus, neutral theory predicts that neutral
rates of evolution should be nearly constant between organisms for functionally
equivalent genes. It directly follows that the divergence of cytochrome
<i>c</i> sequences should be nearly equal between two organisms and their last
common ancestor. For example, according to the theory of common descent,
bacteria, horses, and insects all share a common ancestor in the remote past.
If rates of neutral evolution have been constant since that common ancestor,
then the cytochrome <i>c</i> proteins of bacteria, horses, insects all should
have evolved by the same amount since their last common ancestor. Accordingly,
the divergence of cytochrome <i>c</i> between bacteria and horses should be
nearly the same as the divergence between bacteria and insects. This is the
answer to Camp's next question: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Why would the sequence divergence of cytochrome <i>c</i> between bacteria
and horses be the same as the divergence between bacteria and insects? The
presumed evolutionary lineage from the ancestral cell to a modern bacterium
differs radically from the presumed evolutionary lineage from the ancestral
cell to a modern horse, both of which differ radically from the presumed
evolutionary lineage from the ancestral cell to a modern insect. How could a
uniform rate of divergence have been maintained through such radically
different pathways? According to Michael Denton, a molecular biology
researcher, "At present, there is no consensus as to how this curious
phenomenon can be explained." (<a href="#Denton1998">Denton 1998</a>, 291.) </p>
</td>

</blockquote>

<p> And, as we have shown earlier, Michael Denton knows very little basic
evolutionary theory<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>. <a id="footnote1back"
name="footnote1back"></a>The most likely reason why the rate of divergence has
been quite uniform in all these "radically different" lineages is that
cytochrome <i>c</i> does the exact same thing in all these lineages (it
transports electrons in the fundamental cellular process of oxidative
phosphorylation), and the mutations that do not destroy or change the function
of cytochrome <i>c</i> are necessarily neutral. A better question is "why would
the rate be <i>nonuniform</i> in these different lineages?" Contrary to Camp's
suggestion, there is a consensus explanation for the cytochrome <i>c</i>
sequences provided by neutral theory, the one just explicated above in
simplified form. Wesley Elsberry gives a more detailed explanation of the
cytochrome <i>c</i> data in "<a href=

that the consensus explanation for cytochrome <i>c</i> sequence divergence does
not involve natural selection, but only uses neutral theory, mutation, and
purifying selection. To my knowledge, none of these standard genetic theories
has been seriously criticized by anti-evolutionists (especially the
"scientific" creationists). </p>

<p> An inquisitive person might ask further: "Should the divergence between the
cytochrome <i>c</i> sequences from different organisms be exactly equivalent?"
And the answer is no - mutation, recombination, and sexual reproduction are all
stochastic processes (i.e., they have a large probabilistic element to them).
We expect, even with exactly equivalent background rates of mutation, that
amounts of divergence will be similar, but not equivalent. As with any
stochastic process, there is a finite probability that "surprising" things
might happen. For instance, whenever we flip 50 quarters, we expect that on
average 25 will be heads and 25 will be tails. However, the probability that we
will flip <i>exactly</i> 25 heads and 25 tails is rather small (~11%). There is
a 0.1% chance that we will flip more than twice as many heads than tails. This
means that if we repeat our 50-flip experiment 1000 times, we <i>expect</i> to
flip more than twice as many heads as tails at least once (perhaps more). As
Penny et al. put it in their article "Testing the Theory of Descent": </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "From the proposed stochastic nature of the mechanism of mutation and
selection it would be surprising if the trees were identical. Indeed, it would
be more devastating to Darwinism if different sets of short sequences always
gave identical trees." (<a href="#Penny_etal1991">Penny et al. 1991</a>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Thus, given the stochastic nature of genetics, we in fact expect that
independently derived trees occasionally will not match exactly and that rates
of divergence will vary for the same reasons. </p>

carp, and bullfrogs allegedly shared a common ancestor above the node labeled
"vertebra." Since that time, the branch leading to carp and bullfrogs evolved
independently of the branch leading to lampreys. If the rates of cytochrome

degree of sequence variance between the cytochrome <i>c</i> of lampreys and
carp would be essentially the same as the degree of variance between the

<p> These results are expected if genetics is fundamentally probabilistic
instead of deterministic, as it is. Camp states: "If the rates of cytochrome
<i>c</i> divergence remain uniform regardless of evolutionary pathway, then the
degree of sequence variance between the cytochrome <i>c</i> of lampreys and
carp would be essentially the same as the degree of variance between the

a lack of understanding of probability and statistics, leading to Camp's
commission of a <a
href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/stat.htm">statistical fallacy</a>.
Uniform rates are <i>expected</i> to give unequal results (see the discussion
on mathematics below after the green box). Camp's statements are a nice example
of the <a href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/accident.html">fallacy of
accident</a> (<i>Dicto Simpliciter</i>). Furthermore, Camp is incorrect in his
details. I cannot speak for the original citation (<a
href="#DavisKenyon1993">Davis and Kenyon 1993</a>), but the values that Camp
gives for the divergences of lamprey, carp, and bullfrog cytochrome <i>c</i>
are incorrect. The true divergence between the cytochrome <i>c</i> of <a href=

bullfrogs</a> is 20%. Camp has since explained that he was using an outdated
source (over thirty years old) for these figures, yet he still "stand[s] by"
these figures - even though the sequences I have given above were updated in
1981, 1984, and 2000 (this is easily verified simply by clicking the links I

<p> Camp continues with his surprise that some of the cytochrome <i>c</i>

</blockquote>

<p> There are many problems with this passage. As stated before, such results
are expected if heredity is a stochastic process, as it is. Because genetics is
stochastic, the theory of common descent does not predict that phylogenetic
trees made with single genes will perfectly match other phylogenetic trees -
they must be similar, but not necessarily identical. As already explained in
the "29 Evidences": </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "<b>Gene trees are not equivalent to species trees:</b> from simple
Mendelian genetics we know that genes segregate individually, and that
throughout time individual genes do not necessarily follow organismic
genealogy. An obvious example is the fact that while you may have brown eyes,
your child may have the genes for blue eyes - but that does not mean your child
is not your descendent, or that your brown-eyed children are more closely
related to you than your blue-eyed children. Including multiple genes in the
analysis is a solution to this conundrum." (<a
href="#AviseWollenberg1997">Avise and Wollenberg 1997</a>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Furthermore, Camp has made a more fundamental error here, indicative of his
unfamiliarity with modern evolutionary theory. Camp is directly comparing
distance data (the number of cytochrome c sequence differences) to character
data (the morphological phylogenetic data) and expecting them to match, which
is improper. In the early days of phylogenetic analysis, researchers used
distance data to construct phylogenetic trees because distance algorithms are
simple and fast (they take little computation time). However, for strong
theoretical reasons, distance data is expected to be an unreliable basis for
phylogenetic analyses (though it is approximately correct under certain
conditions). Today, instead of using distance algorithms, evolutionary
biologists use more correct (and much more computationally intensive)
algorithms, such as maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood, which are based on
direct character information. Thus, it is a meaningless criticism to point out
that molecular distances are not necessarily reflected in character-based
phylogenies - that situation is in fact <i>predicted</i> by evolutionary
theory. </p>

<p> Additionally, Camp incorrectly states that "discrepancies between
traditional phylogenies and those based on cytochrome <i>c</i> are well known."
Camp is referring to out-dated cytochrome <i>c</i> analyses which did not
include statistical tests of support for the branches in the phylogenies. When
only statistically reliable branches are considered, the cytochrome <i>c</i>
phylogenies are completely congruent with traditional morphological phylogenies
- even when using distance-based phylogenies. </p>

<p> Apparently, Camp not only misunderstands basic genetics but also has a deep
misunderstanding of basic mathematics (probability and statistics), as <a

<p> There is nothing inconsistent with a uniform rate and nonuniform results.
That is basic statistics. As a very simple example, in the above discussion of
quarter flipping, the rate of "heads" is exactly 0.5 heads per flip. This rate
is <i>exactly</i> constant. However, there is nothing unusual (or "amorphous")
about flipping five heads in a row, or five tails in a row (corresponding to an
average observed rate of one head per flip and zero heads per flip,
respectively). Such results are expected if coin flipping is a stochastic
process, as it is. We expect these results about 6% of the time. In fact, the
outcome of a stochastic process, like coin flipping, radioactive decay, or
spontaneous mutation, should approximate a Gaussian bell-shaped curve (also
known as a "normal curve"), as explained in any <a
href="http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/maybe/maybe5.htm" target="_blank">
entry-level probability and statistics text</a>. </p>

<p> Similarly, if rates of molecular evolution are <i>exactly</i> constant, we
clearly expect that the genetic divergences between species will be unequal in
most cases. In fact, we expect that neutral genetic divergences will be
distributed about a Gaussian bell-shaped curve centered on the average rate of
molecular evolution. Many species should have more divergence than average
(like the rattlesnake cytochrome <i>c</i>), and many species should have less
divergence than average (like the kangaroo cytochrome <i>c</i>). Likewise, we
expect that, if background mutation rates are <i>exactly</i> constant, genetic
divergences between neutral regions of different genes between two species will
also be distributed about a bell-shaped curve. In fact, this is precisely what
is observed (e.g. see the data for humans and mice in Figure C1 at left; <a
href="#KumarSubramanian2002">Kumar and Subramanian 2002</a>). For instance,
from basic probability theory, we expect that 15% of genes between humans and
mice should evolve over 36% faster than the average constant rate (that is 1.36
times the average rate), over 2% should evolve about 70% faster than the
average constant rate, and that 0.5% should evolve over 85% faster than the
average rate. And, as the figure shows, this is exactly what we observe in
humans and mice. Note, this means that in a comparison of one hundred randomly
sampled human and mouse genes, we expect that the most divergent gene will have
0% similarity in neutral regions, while the least divergent gene will have
nearly 100% similarity in neutral regions (see the lower left tail of the bell
curve in Figure C1). These results are predicted, based upon simple math, if
the average background mutation rate is completely <i>constant</i> in both the
human and mouse lineages. This fact illustrates nicely why it is premature to
base strong evolutionary conclusions on an analysis of only one gene (like the
cytochrome <i>c</i> gene) or even a few genes; strong conclusions can only be
based upon a large sampling of genes. </p>

<p> It is rather presumptuous to label a theory "amorphous", when said theory
simply follows basic laws of mathematics. </p>

<p> As stated earlier, Camp's discussion of rates is a <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/redherrf.html">red herring</a> anyway.
Common descent makes no specific predictions concerning rates. Even including
all the known discrepancies, the cytochrome <i>c</i> phylogeny and the
traditional morphological phylogeny match to an extremely high degree with
extremely high statistical significance (<a href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al.
1982</a>). And, as expected, including more genes in the analysis increases the
correspondence between phylogenetic trees (<a href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et
al. 1982</a>; <a href="#Baldauf_etal2000">Baldauf et al. 2000</a>; <a
href="#Hedges1994">Hedges 1994</a>; <a href="#HedgesPoling1999">Hedges and
Poling 1999</a>). In the end, the molecular phylogenetic data, such as the
cytochrome <i>c</i> data, provide one of the strongest and most irrevocable
confirmations of common descent. </p>

</blockquote>

<p> Again, Camp is mistaken. If all organisms are united by descent from a
common ancestor, then there is one single true historical phylogeny for all
organisms, just like there is one single true historical genealogy for any
individual human. It follows that if there is one true phylogeny, then all
organisms fit in that phylogeny uniquely. In other words, all organisms, both
past (e.g. fossils) and present, must conform to the true phylogeny. Since the
standard phylogenetic tree is the best approximation of the true historical
phylogeny, we expect that all fossilized animals should conform to the standard
phylogenetic tree within the error of our scientific methods. If fossilized
animals do not, then there are only two logical possibilities - either our
estimation of the true phylogeny is incorrect, or there is no true phylogeny
(i.e. common descent is false). This last point leads in to Camp's next
mistake: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">

dogmatically than the relationships of others, but none of the branches are set
in stone. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> No branches are viewed "dogmatically" - some branches have strong support
from the data and are very unlikely to be incorrect if common descent is true,
while other branches are known with less confidence. Thus, fossilized organisms
that contradict the very well-supported branches would be inconsistent with
common descent. </p>

<h3>Misunderstanding of the Scientific Method</h3>

<p> Camp has replied: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> It is self-evident that the bare hypothesis of universal common ancestry
affirms only that all creatures descended from the same ancestor. It would be
consistent with <i>all</i> phylogenies rooted in a single ancestor, and
therefore it does not predict <i>any particular</i> phylogeny, such as the
standard phylogeny. For stating this obvious fact, Dr. Theobald accuses me of
misrepresenting evolutionary theory. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Universal common descent is not "consistent with all phylogenies rooted in
a single ancesotor." Universal common descent predicts that there is only one
true phylogeny, not multiple phylogenies. Since it predicts one true phylogeny,
the existence of different phylogenies rooted in a common ancestor is
incompatible with common descent. Camp is correct that common descent "does not
predict <i>any particular</i> phylogeny," but that is a moot point. We must
examine the data and infer the correct particular tree. </p>

<p> Similarly, Newton's Universal Theory of Gravity affirms that all masses
accelerate towards each other proportional to a universal graviational
constant, <b><i>G</i></b>. However, Newton's theory is not consistent with all
values of <b><i>G</i></b>, because the theory predicts that there is only one
true value of <b><i>G</i></b>, not multiple <b><i>G</i></b>s. Of course
Newton's theory does not predict <i>any particular</i> value of
<b><i>G</i></b>. But that is a moot point. We must examine the data and infer
the correct particular value for <b><i>G</i></b>. </p>

<p> Mr. Camp misrepresented evolutionary theory because he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> Universal common ancestry affirms only that all creatures descended from
the same ancestor. There is nothing about that affirmation that requires
conformity to the standard phylogenetic tree. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> That is false. Universal common ancestry also requires that there is only
one true phylogenetic tree. Thus, independent determinations of the standard
phylogenetic tree should conform to each other. The absurdity of Camp's
misrepresentation is clear when the analogous statement is made of Newton's
Universal Theory of Gravity: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Universal gravity affirms only that all masses accelerate towards each
other. There is nothing about that affirmation that requires conformity to the
standard constant <b><i>G</i></b>." </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Of course independent measurements should conform to the standard constant
<b><i>G</i></b>. Careful independent measurements of <b><i>G</i></b> should
give values that agree reasonably well. If they don't, there is something wrong
with the theory. Likewise, careful independent determinations of the standard
phylogenetic tree should agree reasonably well. If they don't, there is
something wrong with the theory. This is very basic science, and it clearly
appears that Camp either does not understand how science works and how theories
are tested or he is, for some reason, intentionally misrepresenting
evolutionary theory. Camp continues his reply: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> The problem is that, since we do not know the true evolutionary history of
organisms, we cannot know whether the standard phylogeny is accurate. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp is incorrect. In science, there are ways to determine the true
evolutionary history (such as cladistics and molecular phylogenetic
reconstruction methods), and we can test those results to see whether the
standard phylogeny is accurate. That is what the entire "<a
href="/faqs/comdesc/">29 Evidences</a>" is about. This situation is paralleled
in all scientific disciplines. We do not know the true gravitational constant,
<b><i>G</i></b>, yet, in science, there are ways to determine it. Additionally,
we can test our results from these measurements and see whether the consensus
value for <b><i>G</i></b> is accurate. </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> My point was that the inaccuracy exposed by any nonconforming organism
could be corrected by adjustments to the phylogeny at a level above the
hypothesized universal common ancestor. So, contrary to Dr. Theobald's claim,
the hypothesis of universal common ancestry would not be proven false by the
discovery of a nonconforming organism. The standard phylogeny simply would be
shown to be in need of modification at some level. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote> 

<p> This is false. There are some mildly nonconforming organisms that could
possibly be incorporated and there are some that cannot. There is no way to
modify the standard phylogeny to incorporate a mammal with feathers or a bird
with a mammalian head and a placenta. Such organisms will not fit anywhere in
the phylogeny. Including a half-mammal/half-bird organism in a cladistic
analysis of mammals, reptiles, and birds destroys the hierarchical structure in
the resulting cladogram (e.g. as measured by the consistency index, CI, the
retention index, RI, the homoplasy index, HI, or the rescaled consistency
index, RCI) and greatly reduces the cladogram's resolution (e.g. as measured by
the statistical bootstrap support for all the branches in the tree). Normally,
including real, allowable intermediates increases the hierarchical structure
and resolution of a cladogram (or at least does not affect it much). </p>

<p> Every scientific theory can accommodate incongruent data to some extent,
yet every scientific theory also has its limits. For example, Newton's
Universal Theory of Gravity predicts that the universal gravitational constant,
<b><i>G</i></b>, is constant in space and time. <b><i>G</i></b> should be the
same everywhere on the earth and in space. The way we test this is to make
multiple independent measurements of <b><i>G</i></b>, at different times,
different locations, and using different methods. Newton's theory can (and
does) accommodate minor discrepancies (as explained and discussed in <a
href="section1.html#pred3">Prediction 3</a>), but there are some values which,
if measured, would be too far out to be reconciled. The same is true of
universal common descent, and a mammal-bird is an example that is too far out
to be reconciled. </p>

<h3>More Misunderstanding of the Scientific Method</h3>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Since phylogenies are by nature provisional, the suggestion that the
hypothesis of common descent would be falsified by "[a]ny finding of

creature, after wrangling over its placement in the schema. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> This demonstrates an underlying misconception of the scientific method.
<i>Everything</i> in science is by nature provisional. However, some things are
more "set in stone" than others, and that is where the concept of
falsifiability comes in. Even Camp's anti-evolutionist source Walter ReMine
understands that science is at once provisional <i>and</i> falsifiable: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "The criterion of falsifiability indicates science is tentative. Science
never achieves certainty. Science is not rigid and dogmatic ... Because our
observations are limited, we can only attain fine shades of <i>near</i>
certainty. ... While science is tentative, it is not flimsy. Science can carry
enough weight that we often speak of a given theory as a fact. ... Science is
also tentative about falsifying a theory. It can be difficult to falsify a
theory with all the finality we would like. ... By testing ... we attain
greater confidence in identifying false hypotheses." (<a
href="#ReMine1993">ReMine 1993</a>, p. 34, emphasis in the original) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Though ReMine often misses the mark, these statements capture the essence of
testability in science quite well. The standard phylogenetic tree, as currently
supported by massive amounts of data, is highly inconsistent with true
mammal-bird intermediates. The phylogenetic tree could not be modified to
accommodate such creatures - they would not fit anywhere. </p>

<p> Ironically, the inflexibility of this aspect of the standard phylogenetic
tree is well-evidenced by Camp's next statements: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">

<p> The ease with which this precise adjustment could occur was illustrated
two decades ago, when "[t]he reality of the 'mammal-bird,' a hypothetical

that birds were most closely related to mammals, which relationship was
supported by two Cambridge scientists' analysis of molecular data. ....
Branches can be rearranged, even between mammals and birds, without skipping a
beat in terms of commitment to common ancestry. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp's use of the Gardiner controversy misses the point entirely; Camp's
reply does not address the issue at hand. It is a fine example of the <i><a
href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/irrelev.htm">ignoratio
elenchi</a></i> fallacy. Camp was responding to the claim that a mammal-bird is
predicted <i>not</i> to exist by current evolutionary theory, based upon common
descent and the consensus phylogenetic tree. Thus, any finding of a mammal-bird
intermediate form in the fossil record would be a falsification. However, the
Gardiner controversy does not concern the finding of an intermediate form that
is contrary to phylogenetic expectations. Rather, it concerns uncertainty in
the consensus phylogenetic tree based upon an analysis of <i>living</i>
organisms. These are two entirely different issues. All scientific measurements
have some level of uncertainity. This is not a problem in science; it just
means we have room to make a more accurate measurement, which, of course, is
always desirable. To provide an adequate counter-example, Camp needs to provide
an instance of where biologists have accepted the finding of an organism that
was contrary to very well-supported portions of the consensus phylogeny
(branches with very low uncertainty). Camp does not do this - we did not find a
mammal-bird intermediate. Instead, he provides an irrelevant, out-dated example
of where biologists have had difficulty resolving a branching order in the
consensus phylogeny. </p>

<p> However, Camp is, again, self-contradictory - his argument is <a
href="http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/incon.htm"> inconsistent</a>. How
can "mammal-birds" at once be contentious and also be accommodated with "ease",
"without skipping a beat"? They can't! The Benton article to which Camp refers
(<a href="#Benton1984">Benton 1984</a>) is wholly devoted to exploring the
extremely surprising (and, at the time, quite troubling) idea that the standard
phylogenetic tree could be so very, very wrong about birds and mammals. There
was nothing "easy" about this possibility - it threatened to shake the very
roots of the well-established phylogeny of life. For example, in response to
Gardiner's outlandish analysis, zoologist Barry Cox wrote this in a <i>News and
Views</i> article in Nature: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "[Gardiner is] now assaulting even the most fundamental roots of the
systems of relationship that the traditional evolutionary morphologists have
developed. ... Gardiner has now used cladistic techniques to transform the
whole system of tetrapod classification. ... The results are so different ...
that a headlong collision is inevitable, for there can be no minor shifting of
viewpoints or emphasis that could lead to a reconciliation or synthesis. ...
Gardiner's suggestions [are] completely at odds with the palaeontological
record ..." (<a href="#Cox1982">Cox 1982</a>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Does this sound like biologists accepted this "precise adjustment" with
"ease"? Does this sound like these "Branches can be rearranged, even between
mammals and birds, without skipping a beat"? In a vain effort to make his
point, Camp felt it necessary to grossly misrepresent the true status of the
controversy. In his in depth criticism of Gardiner's analysis, Oxford zoologist
T. S. Kemp wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "... many, probably the great majority of vertebrate biologists
have dismissed Gardiner's hypothesis as simply outrageous ..."
(<a href="#Kemp1988">Kemp 1988</a>, p. 69) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Notwithstanding Camp's unfounded statements, Gardiner's analysis was not
incorporated or reconciled, nor were branches rearranged in the consensus
phylogeny. In reality, the "contentious issue" was short-lived, as it was soon
shown by several independent researchers that Gardiner's cladistic analysis was
fundamentally flawed at many levels (<a href="#Benton1985">Benton 1985</a>; <a
href="#Benton1991">Benton 1991</a>; <a href="#Gauthier_etal1988">Gauthier et

1988</a>; <a href="#Witmer1991">Witmer 1991</a>). Likewise, the supposed
corroborating molecular evidence was analyzed incorrectly. At the time (the
early '80's), cladistics and molecular phylogenetics were just coming into
their own, and the proper techniques were still getting worked out. In fact,
improvements are still being made today, as is true of technological
innovations in all scientific fields. In the end, all these analyses
contributed positively to our knowledge via improved phylogenetic techniques -
but they did not radically alter the consensus phylogeny. Quite the opposite,
the improved analyses have confirmed that earlier biologists were correct. </p>

<p> As stated above, Camp misses the point. As he says, the issue at hand is
that a mammal-bird discovery would falsify common descent. The issue is
<i>not</i> whether the bird-reptile-mammal branching order is uncertain or
well-resolved. If some scientists conclude that birds are most closely related
to mammals (as Gardiner did), and some other scientists conclude that birds are
most closely related to reptiles (as held by the consensus), that is simply an
example of uncertainty in branching-order of the consensus phylogeny. It does
not address whether the finding of a certain intermediate form (like the
mammal-bird) would be inconsistent with highly-resolved regions of the
consensus phylogeny. In other words, Camp has not provided an example "that
contradicts [the] allegation that a mammal-bird intermediate would falsify
universal common ancestry." Camp has side-stepped that issue. Ironically, Camp
fully admits this in his response: </p>

most closely related to mammals is irrelevant to whether the discovery of a
mammal-bird intermediate would falsify universal common ancestry. </p>

<p> What was the point of offering Gardiner's conclusion if it is irrelevant to
the issue at hand? How can Gardiner's conclusion contradict the evolutionary
prediction when Camp admits that Gardiner's conclusion is irrelevant to the
evolutionary prediction? Is Dr. Theobald really not thinking clearly for
pointing out Mr. Camp's extensive habit of self-contradiction? </p>

<p> Nevertheless, Camp's off-point reply has even more flaws. The opinions of a
single scientist (or of a few scientists) are not necessarily representative of
scientific consensus. One can always find an "expert" who will agree with the
most ludicrous ideas (for an enormous amount of examples refer to <a
href="http://www.quackwatch.com/">QuackWatch</a>). Camp's suggestion that
Gardiner's views on mammal-birds and common descent were in-line with
scientific consensus is incorrect. Such a claim is another example of Camp's
use of the <a href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/authorit.html">false appeal
to authority</a>. Just because Gardiner remained committed to common ancestry
does not mean that his actions were logical or scientific. If Camp does not
think that Gardiner's views were representative of scientific consensus then
Camp's point is still unsound - scientific consensus is what judges the impact
of new discoveries and evidence for scientific theories, not renegade
scientists. In this case, scientific consensus certainly realized the dangerous
consequences of Gardiner's analysis for common descent. That is why T. S. Kemp
and Barry Cox wrote what they did, as quoted above. That is why a slew of
researchers quickly demonstrated exactly where Gardiner's analysis went wrong
and published the results (<a href="#Benton1985">Benton 1985</a>; <a

1988</a>; <a href="#Witmer1991">Witmer 1991</a>). </p>

<p> Please note that, when considering "scientific consensus" in this debate,
it is unnecessary to assume that consensus is correct. The point is not that
consensus is somehow always right; the point is that it is invalid to draw
general conclusions from an exception. Doing so would be a <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/accident.html">fallacy of accident</a>.
Furthermore, it is illogical to blithely assume that an "expert" correctly
judges an issue in his field. Doing so would be a <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/authorit.html">false appeal to
authority</a>. For example, it is unfair to maintain that Christianity condones
pedophilia simply because some Catholic priests have seemingly reconciled the
two. It is invalid to maintain that American Protestantism considers suicide as
acceptable behavior simply because of <a
href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~remoore/jonestown/">Jim Jones</a> (an ordained
minister in the Christian Churches/Disciples of Christ) and the Peoples Temple.
It is incorrect to conclude that modern astrophysics is consistent with an
earth-centered universe (geocentrism) simply because <a
href="http://www.geocentricity.com/aboutdrbouw.htm">Gerardus D. Bouw</a> (Ph.D.
Astronomy, 1973, Case Western Reserve University) maintains that position. It
is untrue that the United States Federal judicial system considers the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution to be unconstitutional and invalid, even though
Judge Lander H. Perez (Louisiana) has submitted <a
href="http://www.ptialaska.net/~swampy/amend_14/amend_14.html">a statement</a>
to Congress claiming such. Likewise, it is invalid to conclude that modern
evolutionary theory is consistent with mammal-birds, simply because of Brian
Gardiner's proposition. (<b>Note</b>: there is no other connection implied
between any of these examples besides the fact that they are extreme instances
of a logical fallacy). </p>

<p> The view promulgated by Gardiner was an extremely marginal one in the
scientific community (to my knowledge there are only three scientists on record
who supported it, including Gardiner). If the majority of the scientific
community had embraced the idea that mammals and birds are closely related, or
even admitted that it was reconcilable with current evolutionary biology, Camp
might have a defensible point about the reliability of the consensus phylogeny
(which is not the point at hand, in any case). In contrast, the mammal-bird
clade was considered "by the great majority of vertebrate biologists" to be
"outrageous" (in Kemp's words), and irreconcilable with contemporary
evolutionary biology (according to Cox, writing in <i>Nature</i>'s <b>News and
Views</b> column, which is carefully selected and widely regarded to represent
scientific consensus on important developments). In spite of the opinions of
the few, scientific consensus maintains that mammal-bird intermediates are
impossible on our earth. This conclusion is all the stronger in light of the
aftermath of the Gardiner controversy. Recall that Camp stated: "The ease with
which this precise adjustment could occur was illustrated two decades ago [by
Brian Gardiner's cladistic analysis]." That "precise adjustment," the switch
from predicting reptile-bird intermediates to predicting mammal-bird
intermediates, occurred with ease for Gardiner. It did not occur with ease for
the scientific consensus, which is where scientific theories are weighed,
tested, confirmed, and falsified. Thus Camp's point stumbles into
self-contradiction: mammal-birds were not simultaneously contentious and also
accommodated with "ease," "without skipping a beat." Camp's reply, therefore,
is utterly without merit on several levels: it misses the mark (by Camp's own
admission) <i>and</i> it is logically flawed. </p>

<p> Additionally, calling it a "misguided attack" on his person, Camp has
denied that he misrepresented the Gardiner controversy: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> The accusation that I misrepresented the controversy is based on the false
premise that I claimed Gardiner's theory gained general acceptance in the
scientific community and that it did so with ease. I claimed neither. </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> This is false. Recall Camp's original claim: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> Should a strikingly birdlike mammal be discovered, the standard tree simply
would be modified to accommodate the new creature, after wrangling over its

<p> The ease with which this precise adjustment could occur was illustrated two
decades ago, when "[t]he reality of the 'mammal-bird,' a hypothetical common
ancestor of birds and mammals, [was] a contentious issue in modern
systematics." </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> The only way the <i>standard</i> phylogenetic tree would be modified is for
scientific consensus to accept the modification. That is why the standard tree
is called "standard." The standard tree is by definition the consensus
phylogeny. It is not called "Gardiner's phylogenetic tree." Thus, Camp indeed
claimed that Gardiner's hypothesis must have gained acceptance in the
scientific community; otherwise, the standard tree could not be adjusted or
modified, as Camp claims it was. Additionally, Camp claimed that this
adjustment to the standard tree occurred with "ease." In spite of Camp's
protestations, it is clear that he did indeed misrepresent the scientific
controversy, since the standard tree was not modified or adjusted due to the
Gardiner controversy. </p>

<h3>Another False Analogy</h3>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Of course, the discovery of a strikingly birdlike mammal would not
necessarily force a shift in thinking about the relationship of mammals and
birds (a placing of their branches next to each other). The birdlike features
could be attributed to convergent evolution. Many organisms are believed by
evolutionists to have evolved similar traits independently. ... If the mammal's
birdlike traits were judged to be the result of convergent evolution, the
species would be shown on the phylogenetic tree as a subset or side branch of
mammals that was unrelated to birds. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp's point is true, but only for limited, trivial cases. Convergence is
more likely the less complex the trait. However, for very complex traits, true
structural convergence is essentially impossible in the context of common
descent and gradualism. For instance, independent evolution of bird flight
feathers is widely considered to be out of the realm of possibility. Camp gives
an example of possible convergence in an attempt to support his above
statements: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> (In fact, some experts believe that the birdlike features of
dromaeosaurids, the dinosaurs considered by most experts to be the sister group
to birds, arose independently rather than by inheritance from the ancestor of
birds.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Though thought unlikely by most paleontologists, such convergence is
possible, since the "bird-like" features of dromaeosaurids are in most cases
very subtle. The "experts" to which Camp refers here are Alan Feduccia and a
few other like-minded biologists. They maintain a minority opinion that
dromaeosaurids and birds are both independent descendents of thecodonts
(thecodonts are primitive dinosaur-like reptiles). In any case, dromaeosaurids
are much more similar to thecodonts than they are to <i>modern</i> birds. Thus,
Feduccia's suggestion of convergence is not so radical, even though the most
parsimonious hypothesis is that birds are the descendents of dromaeosaurids,
which in turn are the descendents of thecodonts. In contrast, the claim that a
mammal independently evolved bird flight feathers is extremely radical from an
evolutionary perspective. Camp's example of possible convergence does nothing
to support his erroneous opinion that evolutionary biology could easily accept
strikingly bird-like mammals. </p>

<h3>More Distortion of Science</h3>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
The shift in thinking over the last 30 years about the relationship of
dinosaurs and birds is an example of a generally accepted phylogenetic
adjustment, albeit at a lower taxonomic level. From the publication of Gerhard
Heilmann's <i>The Origin of Birds</i> in 1926, it was a matter of textbook
orthodoxy that birds were more closely related to thecodonts (an order of
reptiles) than to theropods (a suborder of a different order of reptiles).
Thus, the discovery in 1964 of the birdlike theropod <i>Deinonychus</i> was
contrary to phylogenetic expectations. Today, however, the standard phylogeny
shows birds more closely related to theropods than to thecodonts.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp's claim that "the discovery in 1964 of the birdlike theropod
<i>Deinonychus</i> was contrary to phylogenetic expectations" is false and does
not represent the true status of the scientific situation. As with the Gardiner
cladistic analysis, Camp feels the need to misrepresent the true situation in
order to make a point. Coelurosaurs are theropods, and <i>Deinonychus</i> (the
"surprise" mentioned by Camp above) is a coelurosaur. Here are Gerhard
Heilmann's statements about bird origins from <i>The Origin of Birds</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "On turning from the clumsy Predentates to the Coelurosaurs, we meet with
quite a different type; ... Hollow bones of very light structure, exceedingly
long hind-limbs with strong elongate metatarsals and a "hind-toe," a long,
narrow hand, a long tail and a long neck, large orbits and ventral ribs - these
are bird-features immediately conspicuous." (<a href="#Heilmann1926">Heilmann
1926</a>, p. 165-166) </p>

<p> "... the striking points of similarity between Coelurosaurs and birds
pertained to nearly all the parts of the skeleton ... From this it would seem
rather obvious that it is amongst the Coelurosaurs that we are to look for the
bird ancestor. And yet, this would be too rash, for the very fact that
clavicles are wanting would in itself be sufficient to prove that these
saurians could not possibly be the ancestors of birds. ... We have therefore
reasons to hope that in a group of reptiles closely akin to the Coelurosaurs we
shall be able to find an animal wholly without the shortcomings here indicated
for a bird ancestor [i.e. the lack of clavicles]." (<a
href="#Heilmann1926">Heilmann 1926</a>, p. 183-184) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Thus, the discovery of a bird-like theropod, the coelurosaur
<i>Deinonychus</i>, was clearly anticipated by Heilmann, since Heilmann already
considered coelurosaurs and other theropods to be quite bird-like. It's
bird-like nature was no surprise. <i>Deinonychus</i> is a coelurosaur; many
coelurosaurs had been known before 1964<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><a
id="footnote4back" name="footnote4back"></a>. Coelurosaurs were well-known to
be strikingly bird-like in many respects, as the Heilmann quotes above
demonstrate unequivocally. Thomas. H. Huxley had noted many of the close
similarities between theropods (including coelurosaurs) in the mid-19th century
(<a href="#Huxley1868">Huxley 1868</a>; <a href="#Huxley1870a">Huxley
1870a</a>), as had many other prominent paleontologists in the early 20th
century (<a href="#Witmer1991">Witmer 1991</a>, p. 437-447). Heilmann had
reservations about theropods as bird ancestors only because, at the time,
theropods were not known to have clavicles (a weak argument, of course, since
it is based upon negative evidence - it is now known that clavicles fossilize
poorly). Subsequent findings have established that many theropods indeed have
clavicles, such as <i>Segisaurus, Velociraptor, Euparkeria, Ingenia,
Ornithosuchus, Oviraptor, Saltoposuchus,</i> and <i>Ticinosuchus</i> (<a
href="#Barsbold_etal1990">Barsbold et al. 1990</a>; <a
href="#BryantRussell1993">Bryant and Russel 1993</a>). Some of these dinosaurs
even have true furculae (wishbones), a character once thought to be <i>only</i>
found in birds. Furthermore, it was Thomas H. Huxley who originated the
hypothesis of the theropod ancestry of birds all the way back in 1868 (<a
href="#Huxley1868">Huxley 1868</a>, p. 74). </p>

<p> The resurrection of the theropod ancestry hypothesis was initiated by J. H.
Ostrom in 1973, based upon his re-evaluation of the similarities between
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and coelurosaurs (<a href="#Ostrom1973">Ostrom 1973</a>).
Ostrom listed 21 specific shared derived characters between
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and coelurosaurs as a taxonomic group (not just
<i>Deinonychus</i>) which had mostly been overlooked throughout the years. The
discovery of the bird-like coelurosaur <i>Deinonychus</i> in 1964 (first
described in Ostrom 1969) was further support for the theropod ancestry
hypothesis, but it was not a surprise that "was contrary to phylogenetic
expectations" - it was directly in-line with contemporary phylogenetic
expectations. In reality, in 1964 the hypothesis that birds were descendents of
thecodonts was thought most likely, yet whether theropods were the
intermediates between thecodonts and birds was still an open question lacking
any firm supporting evidence either for or against (<a href="#Bock1969">Bock
1969</a>; <a href="#Feduccia1996">Feduccia 1996</a>, p. 55-56; <a
href="#Witmer1991">Witmer 1991</a>, p. 437-447). Today, with the increased
knowledge given by the acquisition of many more fossils, and with the use of
rigorously developed cladistic techniques, birds are <i>still</i> thought to be
the descendents of certain thecodonts (or more correctly, of archosauromorphs,
which are a well-defined class of thecodonts - "thecodont" is an outdated,
grab-bag term which is no longer used in the modern paleontological
literature). Ostrom specifically postulated a
"thecodont-coelurosaur-<i>Archaeopteryx</i>-Aves phylogeny" (<a
href="#Ostrom1973">Ostrom 1973</a>). Birds are descended from "thecodonts"
<i>via</i> theropods. </p>

<p> Furthermore, Camp claims that, based on Heilmann's analysis, "it was a
matter of textbook orthodoxy that birds were more closely related to thecodonts
... than to theropods" - a statement which, strictly, is incorrect. Heilmann
only thought that coelurosaurs were not bird <i>ancestors</i>, and he thought
it likely that thecodonts, as a group, <i>were</i> bird ancestors. That does
not mean that birds are necessarily more closely related to thecodonts than to
theropods (or coelurosaurs). For instance, are you more closely related to your
siblings or to your great great great great grandfather? Of course, you are
much more closely related to your siblings - yet they are not your ancestors
(siblings share half their DNA on average, whereas an individual and her great
great great great grandfather share only 1/64<sup>th</sup> of their genes).
Likewise, birds could be more closely related to coelurosaurs than thecodonts,
while simultaneously being the descendants of thecodonts but not of
coelurosaurs. In fact, this is likely what Heilmann thought, as he says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "We have therefore reasons to hope that in a group of reptiles closely akin
to the Coelurosaurs we shall be able to find an animal wholly without the
shortcomings here indicated for a bird ancestor. Such a group is possibly the
Pseudosuchians [Pseudosuchians are 'thecodonts'] ..." (<a
href="#Heilmann1926">Heilmann 1926</a>, p. 183-184) </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>More Misunderstanding of the Scientific Method, and Another
Self-contradiction</h3>

<p> Back to Camp's criticism of the prediction of intermediate/transitional
organisms: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The assertion that all fossilized animals conform to the standard
phylogenetic tree is unprovable, because one can never be sure that all
fossilized animals have been discovered. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp is clearly correct, but this is certainly not a problem. Camp has
pinpointed the very reason why this prediction is falsifiable and thus
scientific. The assertion that all fossilized animals conform to the standard
phylogenetic tree is unprovable, yes, like all scientific statements - but it
is relatively simple to prove this assertion false. Which, by the way, is the
essence of falsifiability. </p>

<p> Interestingly, this turns out to be yet another instance where Camp
contradicts himself. At the end of his <a href=
"http://www.trueorigin.org/theobald1d.asp#pred15" target="_blank">criticism of
prediction 15</a>, Camp writes this <i>non sequitur</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> The suggestion that universal common ancestry would be falsified by "the
discovery of a mammal without crossed gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts,
or a reptile or mammal without blindspots in its eyes" is incorrect. It is
another example of taking what is known not to exist and claiming that
evolution predicts it could not exist. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In one instance Camp (correctly) asserts that "one can never be sure that
all [organisms] have been discovered," and that, therefore, we can never prove
a given prediction of common descent about organisms. Later, when it is more
convenient to take the opposite stance, Camp (incorrectly) asserts that a
prediction of common descent is not really a prediction, since certain features
of organisms are already "known not to exist." How can we know that all mammals
and reptiles have crossed gastrointestinal tracts and blindspots if we cannot
be sure that we have discovered all mammals and reptiles? We can't. We can
never be certain of what exists with incomplete knowledge of the world, and
this is precisely why scientific predictions, like the predictions of common
descent, are testable, confirmable, and falsifiable. </p>

<h3>Faulty Logic</h3>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> But more importantly, the premise [that all fossilized animals conform to
the standard phylogenetic tree] turns out to be merely a restatement of the
claim of nested hierarchy. It adds nothing to the case for common ancestry.
 </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> To the contrary, it is not simply a restatement of the nested hierarchy.
The "nested hierarchy" statement, given in <a href= "section1.html#pred2"
target="_blank">prediction 2</a>, is that modern organisms should conform to a
nested hierarchy if common descent is true. It is tested with modern species by
zoologists, botanists, etc. <a href= "section1.html#pred3"
target="_blank">Prediction 3</a> concerns the morphologies of organisms that
existed in the past. It is tested with fossils by paleontologists. In
principle, prediction 2 could pass, while prediction 3 could fail, or vice
versa. Therefore, they are not the same. Both predictions add to the case for
common ancestry, since they are independently tested and confirmed. </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> ... according to the definition of "intermediate" given in the article,
dromaeosaurids are <i>not</i> reptile-bird intermediates and synapsids are

"[a] fossil or modern species that displays characters <i>definitive</i> of two
or more different taxa" (emphasis supplied). Dromaeosaurids do not display
characters that are <i>definitive</i> of both reptiles and birds (which is why
they are not considered birds), and synapsids do not display characters that
are <i>definitive</i> of both reptiles and mammals (which is why they are not
considered mammals). </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp is splitting hairs over terminology here. The word "definitive" is not
a technical phylogenetic term, and it is intended to mean "unequivocal," not
necessarily "unique" (in cladistic terminology such a "definitive character"
would be equivalent to a synapomorphy, but not always an autapomorphy).
Dromaeosaurs share many definitive characters with birds, such as a furcula, a
retroverted pubis, very long forelimbs, pneumatic (hollow) bones, and a
relatively large brain. Dromaeosaurs also share many definitive characters with
reptiles, such as teeth, free articulating trunk vertebrae, a long tail with
free vertebrae (no pygostyle), less than six sacral vertebrae, unfused
metacarpals, unfused metatarsals, and gastralia. As listed above, dromaeosaurs
share many characters with birds, but they also lack many unique characters
that birds have (such as wings) - so they are not birds. Dromaeosaurs are
indeed intermediates between birds and reptiles (especially dinosaurs)
according to the given definition, and similarly, synapsids are indeed
intermediates between mammals and reptiles. </p>

<p> In footnote 13, Camp reiterates this error, plus making a few new ones: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Dromaeosaurids are considered a sister group to birds, meaning they are
believed to have shared with birds a most recent common ancestor. They are not
believed to have been in the actual lineage of birds. In fact, they possess
certain specializations, such as the stiffened tail, that make them ill suited
as ancestors. Of course, the presumed common ancestor of birds and
dromaeosaurids is thought to have been quite dromaeosaurid-like. As already
noted, dromaeosaurids do not qualify as reptile-bird intermediates according to
Dr. Theobald's definition. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp's concern about "actual lineage" is another misleading red herring and
is addressed in the next section. The statement that the stiffened tail makes
dromaeosaurids "ill suited" as bird ancestors is ridiculous; birds have
extremely stiffened tails (i.e. the pygostyle). Dromaeosaurs indeed have
specialized structures that are not likely to be found in bird ancestors, but
the stiffened tail itself is not one. The pertinent derived structures are
found <i>on</i> the tails of Dromaeosaurs. The stiffened tails of Dromaeosaurs
have specialized rod-like extensions of the vertebral zygapophyses which are
not found in the stiffened tails of birds. </p>

the least. I have elsewhere tried to point out some of the limitations of those
claims (see, "<a href="http://www.trueorigin.org/birdevo.asp"

<p> A detailed criticism of the two articles cited above will not be given
here. However, I will note that both criticisms boil down to two main points:
(1) that some transitional fossils are more derived than would be required for
ancestors, and (2) that some transitional fossils are not in perfect
chronological order relative to their cladistic rank. Neither point carries any
weight as evidence against common descent, for the simple reason that common
descent does not predict either (1) that transitional fossils are ancestors, or
(2) that transitional fossils should be in perfect chronological order relative
to their cladistic rank. If common descent does not make these claims, then
observations that contradict these claims cannot be evidence against common
descent. Either Mr. Camp does not fully understand modern evolutionary theory
or he misrepresents its implications. </p>

<p> Point (2), concerning the chronological order of transitional forms, is
dealt with in the next section covering Prediction 5. For point (1), as was
stated concerning intermediate/transitional forms in the original <a href=
"section1.html#pred4" target="_blank">prediction 4</a> and <a href=
"section5.html#pred25" target="_blank">prediction 25</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "A subtle, yet important point is that a strict cladistic evolutionary
interpretation precludes the possibility of identifying true ancestors; only
intermediates or transitionals can be positively identified. (For the purposes
of this article, transitionals and intermediates are considered synonymous.)
The only incontrovertible evidence for an ancestor/descendant relationship is
the observation of a birth; obviously this is normally rather improbable in the
fossil record. Intermediates are not necessarily the same as the exact
predicted ancestors; in fact, it is rather unlikely that they would be the
same. Simply due to probability considerations, the intermediates that we find
will most likely not be the true ancestor of any modern species, but will be
closely related to the predicted common ancestor. The minor implication
concerning fossil intermediates is that the intermediates we do find will
likely have additional derived characters besides the primitive characters that
identified them as intermediates. Because of these considerations, when a new
and important intermediate fossil species is discovered, paleontologists will
usually note that the transitional species under study is probably not an
ancestor, but rather is an evolutionary 'side-branch.'" </p>

predict that the majority of fossil species that we find should not be the
actual common ancestors of modern species, but rather they should be related
organisms that eventually ended in extinction." </p>

<p> To restate - common descent predicts that we may find transitional forms,
but transitional forms are not necessarily the same as common ancestors.
Presumably, Mr. Camp <i>does</i> understand this aspect of modern evolutionary
theory but has chosen to misrepresent it, as he has written this <a href=

process in 1984 when Cracraft wrote, "Part of the confusion apparent *in the
scientific literature* I suggest, stems from the definition of 'transitional
form.'") They now claim as a "transitional form" any creature that is
stratigraphically and morphologically between any two taxa, without any regard
for whether the particular species represent a lineage. (And they sometimes
take creatures that are NOT stratigraphically intermediate and simply assume
they must have been.) This is a useful PR strategy for evolutionists because
whenever John Q. Public hears "transitional form," he still thinks "lineage."

<p> In other words, Camp understands that common descent, at least in its
modern incarnation, does not predict that transitional forms are necessarily
common ancestors<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>. <a id="footnote2back"
name="footnote2back"></a> However, Camp nevertheless persists in arguing that
fossils which are transitional, yet have other derived characters that exclude
them as ancestors, are problematic for common descent. He persists in making
this misleading argument in the two articles cited above and in his critique of
the "29 Evidences," as well as in <a href=
"http://www.trueorigin.org/whales.asp" target="_blank">The Overselling of Whale
Evolution</a> (all updated as recently as October 7, 2001). Furthermore, Camp
mistakenly claims that transitional form originally meant something other than
it does now, and that evolutionary biologists were compelled to adjust the
definition due to conflicting evidence (a position apparently borrowed from
Walter ReMine, e.g. ReMine 1993, p. 294-296, 414-415). Both Camp and ReMine are
incorrect; evolutionary biologists have not "changed the definition," nor have
they changed the relevant prediction. First, the definition is easily and
naturally derived from a phylogenetic tree and, second, Charles Darwin used the
modern definition in <i>The Origin of Species</i> in 1859 when he first
proposed the modern theory of common descent and first introduced phylogenetic
trees to the scientific world. The following quotes illustrate this point quite
clearly: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> ... we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by
which each complex instinct has been acquired -- for these could be found only
in the lineal ancestors of each species -- but we ought to find in the
collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought at
least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and this we
certainly can do. (<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p. 320) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Referring to his famous <a href= "CDhierarchy.html#CDfig"
target="_blank">figure</a>, Darwin explained: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new
species F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character, but to
have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only in a slight
degree. In this case its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be
of a curious and circuitous nature. Being descended from a form that stood
between the parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to be extinct and unknown,
it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups
descended from these two species. But as these two groups have gone on
diverging in character from the type of their parents, the new species (F14)
will not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the
two groups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases before his
mind. (<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p. 157) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p> ... the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings, which,
though generally belonging to the same orders, families, or genera, with those
now living, yet are often, in some degree, intermediate in character between
existing groups; and we can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived
at various remote epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.
(<a href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p. 158) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> And, </p>

<blockquote>
<p> Supposing B and C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an
older and underlying bed ... A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and
yet would not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all
respects. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several modified
descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same formation, and unless we
obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not recognize their blood
relationship, and should consequently rank them as distinct species. (<a
href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, p. 426) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> More relevant evidence is given from the early evolutionary biologist,
Thomas Henry Huxley: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> Every fossil which takes an intermediate place between forms of life
already known, may be said, so far as it is intermediate, to be evidence in
favour of evolution, inasmuch as it shows a possible road by which evolution
may have taken place. ... Suppose A, B, C to be three forms, while B is
intermediate in structure between A and C. Then the doctrine of evolution
offers four possible alternatives. A may have become C by way of B; or C may
have become A by way of B; or A and C may be independent modifications of B; or
A, B, and C may be independent modifications of some unknown D. ... it is
always probable that one may not hit upon the exact line of filiation, and, in
dealing with fossils, may mistake uncles and nephews for fathers and sons. </p>

<p> I think it necessary to distinguish between [...] classes of intermediate
forms, as intercalary types and linear types. When I apply the former term, I
merely mean to say that as a matter of fact, the form B, so named, is
intermediate between the others, in the sense in which the <i>Anoplotherium</i>
is intermediate between the Pigs and the Ruminants - without either affirming,
or denying, any direct genetic relation between the three forms involved. When
I apply the latter term, on the other hand, I mean to express the opinion that
the forms A, B, and C constitute a line of descent, and that B is thus part of
the lineage of C. (<a href="#Huxley1870b">Huxley 1870b</a>, p. 348-350) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> From a popular introductory evolutionary college textbook from the '50s and
'60s: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> [Intermediate form] always included the idea of a form standing midway
between two groups of animals now clearly separate from each other. (<a
href="#Moody1953">Moody 1953</a>, p. 188) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> From a modern introductory evolutionary textbook: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> <b>transitional form</b> A species that exhibits traits common to ancestral
and derived groups, especially when the groups are sharply differentiated. (<a
href="#FreemanHerron2001">Freeman and Herron 2001</a>, p. 686) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> From all these quotes it is evident that early evolutionary biologists did
not necessarily equate "intermediate" with "ancestor," and that intermediates
do not need to be part of a direct genealogical lineage. This has been clear
from the outset. Even in the cases where intermediates are ancestors, Darwin
explained that ancestors may have derived characters which were subsequently
lost in their descendents. Finally, neither Darwin nor Huxley expected that we
should necessarily identify common ancestors, but rather that we should find
<i>intermediates</i>. These remain the modern evolutionary views (they are now
most often couched in cladistic terminology). </p>

<p> Camp complains that "This is a useful PR strategy for evolutionists because
whenever John Q. Public hears 'transitional form,' he still thinks 'lineage.'"
This gripe is humorous, since "transitional form" is a scientific term, and as
such should be defined by scientists as they wish. It's as if Camp were
complaining because in Newtonian physics the product of mass and acceleration
is called a "force," and that "force" is inappropriate because it sounds too
"mystical" to the layperson. Besides, if evolutionary biologists wanted to
convey "lineage," the most obvious tact would be to use the term "ancestors" in
place of "transitional forms" - but that would be misleading. In spite of
Camp's bias, "transitional form" is a perfectly accurate description which has
no genealogical connotations. </p>

<p> Consequently, since the terms "intermediate" and "transitional" have been
defined since the genesis of evolutionary theory, Mr. Camp has no justification
in perpetuating misleading arguments and statements concerning the proper
evolutionary definitions of these terms and the relevant predictions of common
descent. In doing so, Camp joins the ranks of other creationist
anti-evolutionists who knowingly reinforce the widespread, yet incorrect, lay
public perception that transitional forms are always common ancestors. </p>

<h3>An Attack on Science</h3>

<p> Mr. Camp concludes this section with a veiled attack upon the scientific
method itself: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> 
<p> But even if one granted that reptiles evolved into a bird and a mammal,
that would not establish that reptiles and all other organisms descended from a
common ancestor, which is the proposition being argued. The difference between
a bacterium and a reptile, not to mention the other organisms, is considerably
greater than the difference between a reptile and a bird or a reptile and a
mammal. So the fact a reptile could evolve into a bird or a mammal would not
mean that a bacterium could evolve into a reptile and everything else. In fact,
granting that reptiles evolved into a bird and a mammal would not even
establish that all birds and all mammals descended from a reptile. That would
be an assumption. </p>
 </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In this paragraph Camp is criticizing the fundamental scientific practice
of extrapolation. Extrapolation underlies all of science; without
extrapolation, we could not make any scientific conclusions or predictions.
When we sent the <i>Surveyor 1</i> spacecraft to the moon in 1966, we
<i>assumed</i> that Newton's laws of physics operated on the moon, just as they
operate on the earth. We <i>assumed</i> this even though we had never sent
anything to the moon's surface before. And, of course, we were correct - so
correct that two years later we entrusted the lives of several men to our
assumption. Our assumption was the result of extrapolating from what was known
(earth bound physics) to what was unknown (lunar physics). Furthermore, we
assume that Newton's laws of physics hold on Neptune and Uranus, even though we
have never explored the surfaces of those planets. Likewise, once we have
established that certain reptiles have evolved into birds and mammals, we can
easily assume that all birds and mammals are descendents of reptiles. We can
assume this because it is trivial to conclude that all birds are related by
common descent. If a reptile can evolve into a bird then certainly a bird can
evolve into another bird. This particular extrapolation should not be
controversial for Mr. Camp, since creationists of all stripes generally believe
that all birds are modified descendents of an original created bird "kind."
Once we have established that something like a bird can evolve from a reptile,
we assume that similar things happened with other species and in other
lineages. </p>

Camp has replied to this:

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> According to Dr. Theobald, I am here denying the legitimacy of the
principle of extrapolation and thus depriving science of its ability to make
any conclusions or predictions. All I am doing is pointing out the difference

</td>

</blockquote> 

<p> Once again we find evidence of Camp's misunderstanding of basic science and
the scientific method. Camp errs in claiming that there is a difference between
what is extrapolated or assumed and what is proven. In science, nothing can be
proven. The reason nothing can be proven is very simple - all scientific
conclusions rely upon the fallacy of <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/afthecon.html"><i>affirming the
consequent</i></a>, and in doing so they rely upon inductive extrapolation. In
contrast, a theory conceivably could be shown to be false by using a valid <a
href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Modus_tollens"><i>modus tollens</i></a>
argument. These issues were the foundation behind Sir Karl Popper's reasoning
and his falsifiability criterion for the scientific method. In the end, though,
even falsification is flawed, as the premises of any <i>modus tollens</i>
argument cannot be proven since their validity is also established by affirming
the consequent. Mr. Camp surely is aware of this, as he appears to be
well-versed in logic. To clarify the import of this scientific dilemma,
consider the following example provided by Mr. Camp in his discussion of
extrapolation: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Earth-bound physics can be extrapolated to the solar system and universe,
but that would not mean the extrapolation was justified. That would have to be
demonstrated by evidence (which it was prior to the moon landing in 1969). </p> 
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp thinks that it was valid to assume that the laws of physics worked on
the moon like they do on the earth, because he thinks this particular
extrapolation was proven prior to the 1969 moon landing. The logic goes
something like this: </p>

<p> <b>Premise 1:</b> If laws of earth-bound physics are obeyed on the moon,
then spacecraft which we send there will behave as we predict, based upon
earth-bound physics. </p>

<p> <b>Premise 2:</b> Our spacecraft behaved as we predicted (such as the
<i>Surveyor 1</i> spacecraft in 1966). </p>

<p> <b>Conclusion:</b> The laws of earth-bound physics are obeyed on the moon.
</p>

<p> It should be immediately obvious that this argument is a classic example of
affirming the consequent, a fallacy of propositional logic. In the above
argument, we have extrapolated from one event (the <i>Surveyor 1</i>
spacecraft) to a generality. For some reason, Camp thinks an extrapolation here
is "demonstrated by the evidence," even though it is logically fallacious, but
he does not allow extrapolation in biology. As explained earlier, in his attack
on extrapolation Camp is attacking all of science. In fact, if we deny science
the right to extrapolation, we deprive science of the ability to make
predictions and conclusions. If we allow extrapolation, we simply cannot claim
that scientific conclusions are proven. This does not mean, however, that
science cannot approximate reality and make useful predictions and
explanations, as it obviously does. In practice, scientists use probability and
statistics to quantify the degree of support that evidence provides for a given
hypothesis or theory. In sum, since nothing can be proven in science, and all
is extrapolation, Camp is not "pointing out the difference between what is
extrapolated or assumed and what is proved" - he is attacking the scientific
practice of extrapolation, plain and simple. Mr. Camp's philosophical and
theological bias allows him to ignore scientific extrapolation unless the
conclusions conflict with his preconceptions. </p>

<p> Camp ends here on a strange note by adhering to only birds, reptiles, and
mammals. The prediction being criticized was the general prediction from common
descent of transitional forms. The bird-reptile transitional forms (such as
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the various wingless feathered dinosaurs recently
found in China) that Camp mentions are only a small minority of the <a href=
"http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html"
target="_blank">numerous transitional forms</a> found in the fossil record. All
of these intermediates linking the grand swath of living and extinct organisms
certainly do offer strong support for universal common descent when taken as a
whole. </p>

<h2><a id="pred5" name="pred5"></a>Prediction 5: Chronological order of
predicted common ancestors</h2>

<h3>More Misrepresentation of Evolutionary Theory, and Another
Self-contradiction</h3>

<p> Camp correctly restates the prediction and then begins his criticism in
earnest: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> There is nothing about the hypothesis of universal common ancestry that
requires organisms to have descended in the pattern depicted in the standard
phylogeny. ... A phylogeny is simply a depiction of the order in which
evolutionists believe taxa arose, not the order in which they were
<i>required</i> to arise. </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp has it backwards. Cladistic phylogenies are built based upon
morphology. The order in which organisms arose is a deduction from a phylogeny.
Thus, whenever we have a well-supported phylogeny, the order in which organisms
are required to have arisen is firmly predicted, based upon that phylogeny.
Camp directly contradicts himself in the next paragraph: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> ... ancestral taxa must have existed before any taxa that descended from
them ... </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Yes, and that is exactly why a phylogeny predicts the relative order in
which taxa have arisen during evolution. </p>

<p> Camp has responded to this: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td> ... one cannot predict from universal common ancestry that intermediates
will appear as reflected in the standard phylogeny. That prediction must be
rooted elsewhere than in the bare hypothesis of universal common ancestry. ...
the expectation that organisms will appear in a particular order is <i>not</i>
a deduction from universal common ancestry; it arises from a phylogeny. Thus,
the hypothesis of universal common ancestry would not be proven false by the
discovery of a fossil "intermediate" out of the order reflected in the standard
phylogeny. </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Here Camp's words are still confused and again misrepresent evolutionary
theory. The standard phylogeny is the rigorous scientific depiction of
universal common descent; they are one and the same. The reasoning is very
simple: common descent is the hypothesis that all living species are
genealogically related, and everything that is related has a genealogy. A
genealogy of species is a phylogeny, and thus the genealogy of all species is
the standard phylogeny. Since organisms must have arisen in the order depicted
in a phylogeny, the order of evolution of all organisms is a deduction from
common descent. </p>

<p> To reveal the incorrectness of Camp's statements, let's construct an
analogous comment with Newton's Theory of Gravity (the universal
<u>G</u>ravitational <u>I</u>nverse <u>S</u>quare <u>L</u>aw, GISL) replacing
universal common ancestry: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> ... one cannot predict from universal GISL that masses will accelerate as
reflected by the standard gravitational constant, <b><i>G</i></b>. That
prediction must be rooted elsewhere than in the bare hypothesis of universal
GISL. ... the expectation that masses will accelerate at a given rate is
<i>not</i> a deduction from universal GISL; it arises from a gravitational
constant. Thus, the hypothesis of universal GISL would not be proven false by
the discovery of a mass which does not accelerate as expected according to the
standard gravitational constant, <b><i>G</i></b>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> I hope it is clear that these statements are incorrect, as are the
analogous ones that Camp makes about common descent. The reason that these
comments are incorrect is because the standard gravitational constant
<b><i>G</i></b> is the rigorous scientific quantification of universal GISL,
just like the standard phylogeny is for common descent. If universal GISL is
true, then all masses must accelerate at rates consistent with the universal
constant <b><i>G</i></b>. If universal common descent is true, then all
organisms must have arisen in the order depicted in the standard phylogeny. </p>

<blockquote>

<p> Failing to grasp the point, Dr. Theobald accuses me of contradicting

<p> Camp contradicts himself because he fails to grasp the truism that the
standard phylogeny is equivalent to a specification of universal common descent
on our planet (just like the universal gravitational constant <b><i>G</i></b>
specifies the universal GISL in our universe). </p>

"reptile-bird intermediates," first appear in the fossil record some 25 million

argues must appear in the order suggested by the standard phylogeny, it is
simply assumed that dromaeosaurids lived tens of millions of years before there
is any evidence of their existence. (The ambiguity of "<i>general</i>

<p> The issue of "out-of-order" fossils has been addressed thoroughly in the
updated version of <a href= "section1.html#pred5" target="_blank">Prediction
5</a>. If we consider the entire geological record of the earth, an uncertainty
of 25 million years is equivalent to less than 0.6% relative uncertainty. If we
consider only the fossil record of life, an error of 25 million years is
equivalent to, at most, a 1% relative uncertainty. Both values are overall
quite minor. In fact, we know empirically that the error inherent in the fossil
record is worse than that. For example, the coelacanth last appeared in the
fossil record 80 million years ago, yet it is alive today. Thus, arguing that
certain fossils are "out-of-order" by merely 25 million years is a meaningless
argument. It carries no scientific weight. In contrast, the finding that these
fossils were "out-of-order" by, say, 150 million years would be much more
significant, since the resolution of the fossil record is known to be better
than that in most cases (especially throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic). </p>

<p> The assertion that "The ambiguity of '<i>general</i> chronological order'
prevents such nonconformities from falsifying the claim [of prediction 5]" is
incorrect. There are very well defined scientific statistical methods for
determining whether the chronological order of fossils <i>generally</i> matches
the order required by the consensus phylogenies. If stratigraphy generally
matches phylogeny, then there is a positive correlation between stratigraphic
position and phylogenetic rank. It is also possible to demonstrate that there
is either no correlation between phylogeny and stratigraphy or that there is an
anti-correlation. Demonstrating a statistically significant negative
correlation between the standard phylogenetic tree and the fossil sequence
would be a firm falsification of this basic macroevolutionary prediction.
However, as detailed in <a href= "section1.html#pred5"
target="_blank">Prediction 5</a>, there is overall a statistically significant
positive correlation between stratigraphy and phylogeny, which is a strong
confirmation of the prediction that "fossilized intermediates should appear in
the correct general chronological order based on the standard phylogenetic
tree." </p>

<p> True, but they were only given as representative examples, not as sole

<p> Again, Camp is quite mistaken. The quote from Kurt Wise is supported by
opinion only, not by facts or by any published analysis of the data. In
reality, the more diverse the taxa that are included in the analysis, the
stronger the correlation between stratigraphy and phylogeny, and the more

Camp has replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">

<p> That is true, but it does not alter the fact Wise performed the analysis
and reached the quoted conclusion. </p>
</td>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Actually, we have no evidence that Wise performed the analysis. We can take
Wise's word for it (and in fact I do)<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>, <a
id="footnote3back" name="footnote3back"></a> but most importantly we have no
reason to believe that Wise's analysis is correct. That is exactly why science
is fundamentally dependent upon peer review - other scientists need to evaluate
the data and double check the methods and conclusions of any scientific
analysis. It is quite common for even respectable, intelligent, well-meaning
scientists to make mistakes. As might be expected, anti-evolutionists
(especially the "scientific" creationists) are not fond of peer review. </p>

<p> Dr. Theobald then gives the impression that Wise's conclusion is

</table>
</blockquote>

<p> In fact, that "impression" is quite correct, and it is based on numerous
published analyses from many different researchers. </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> None of those studies duplicated Wise's analysis. That is, they did not
compare the order of all kingdoms, phyla, and classes with their most
reasonable phylogenies. Rather, they took multiple cladograms of a narrower
range of taxa and compared them with the fossil record for those groups. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> These statements are ludicrous. Wise's analysis has never been published;
how does Camp know what Wise did? </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="green" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Moreover, the results are not as impressive as one might think from Dr.
Theobald's comments. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Camp then goes on to list specific data from some of the referenced
published papers which demonstrate a highly significant correlation between
stratigraphic order and phylogeny. Camp erroneously believes it is problematic
that a minority of single cladograms show no correlation with stratigraphic
data. If this were true of scientific theories, then the fact that smoking
causes cancer would be falsified, since many people who smoke do not develop
cancer. But science does not work that way. All physical processes involve
stochastic (chance) elements, and scientific results are evaluated
statistically. Camp's argument is another clear example of the <a
href="http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/accident.html">fallacy of accident</a> (or
more correctly, "<a
href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/stat.htm">converse accident</a>").
Camp conveniently omits the statistical analyses which demonstrate exactly how
impressive the total data really are. For instance, Michael Benton and Rebecca
Hitchin published a recent, greatly expanded, and detailed stratigraphic
analysis of 384 published cladograms of various multicellular organisms (<a
href="#BentonHitchin1997">Benton and Hitchin 1997</a>). Using the three
measures of congruence between the fossil record and phylogeny mentioned by
Camp (the RCI, GER, and SCI), these researchers observed values "skewed so far
from a normal distribution [i.e. randomness] that they provide evidence for
strong congruence of the two datasets [fossils and cladograms]." The results
were overall extremely statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0005), a result that
<i>is</i> extremely impressive. With his blatant anti-science bias, Camp might
subjectively feel that these "results are not as impressive as one might
think," however, scientists use statistics as an objective measure of
"impressiveness." High statistical significance is considered as strongly
confirming the predictions of a theory (P &le; 0.01); the results from Benton
and Hitchin's analyses are <i>at least</i> 500 times more impressive than that.
As the authors comment in their discussion: </p>

<blockquote>

<p> "... the RCI and SCI metrics showed impressive left-skewing; the majority
of cladograms tested show good congruence between cladistic and stratigraphic
information. Cladists and stratigraphers may breathe easy: the cladistic method
appears, on the whole, to be finding phylogenies that may be close to the true
phylogeny of life, and the sequence of fossils in the rocks is not misleading.
... it would be hard to explain why the independent evidence of the
stratigraphic occurrence of fossils and the patterns of cladograms should show
<i>such striking levels of congruence</i> if the fossil record and the
cladistic method were hopelessly misleading." (<a
href="#BentonHitchin1997">Benton and Hitchin 1997</a>, p. 889, emphasis added)
</p>

</blockquote>

<p> In sum, the chronological appearance of fossils in the fossil record
generally matches very well with the order required by the consensus phylogeny
of the major taxa. Although it was possible to falsify this prediction, this
prediction has been confirmed and offers strong support for the theory of
common descent. </p>

<h2><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p> Camp's criticism of Section 1 of the "29 Evidences" was nearly twice as
long as Section 1 itself; my response to Camp's criticism of Section 1 is
nearly four times as long as the original Section 1. The remaining four
sections will have to wait. I have read them, and they are more of the same.
None are difficult to rebut, except for the time and effort required. As stated
at the beginning of this rebuttal, Camp's critique is error-ridden in various
ways, and is plagued by this "host of intellectual sins" (in Camp's own words):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Red herrings</li>

<li>Self-contradictions</li>

<li>Equivocation</li>

<li>Two wrongs make a right</li>

<li>Fallacies of accident</li>

<li>Ignoratio elenchi</li>

<li>Naive theological assumptions</li>

<li>Insufficient knowledge of basic biology, molecular biology, biochemistry
and genetics</li>

<li>Misunderstanding of the scientific method</li>

<li>Straw man arguments</li>

<li>Forwarding of untestable competing "hypotheses"</li>

<li>Mischaracterization of evolutionary theory</li>

<li>Quoting out of context</li>

<li>Fallacies of accent</li>

<li>Distortion of scientific controversies</li>

<li>Arguments from authority</li>

<li>False analogies</li>
</ol>

<p> Each of these "tactics" resurfaces in the remaining four sections of the
critique. It should be obvious from even this limited rebuttal that Camp's
criticism of the "29 Evidences" is without any scientific merit. </p>

<p> Camp concludes his article with this claim for his motivation: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> Dr. Theobald [is] certain that the evidence of nature points ineluctably
to the conclusion of universal common ancestry. I once shared that opinion of
history, but having shifted my point of view, I find that the same evidence
points to something entirely different. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> What is this "something entirely different"? From the second sentence of
Camp's critique: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>
<p> I believe the founding members of these groups [of organisms] were created
miraculously and separately by God. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> There is good reason to be skeptical of the claim that Camp was led to this
conclusion by the "evidence of nature." Camp has written elsewhere that his
rejection of evolutionary theory is not based in scientific evidence, but
rather it is a result of a religious conviction to a literal interpretation of
Genesis. </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" align="center" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> "[Scripture] cannot contain errors or falsehoods. Everything in it must be
true ... " (<a href="#Camp1999">Camp 1999</a>, p. 20-21) </p>

<p> "I sympathize with the desire to present Scripture as compatible with
current scientific orthodoxy, but the exegetical objections to this theory
strike me as insurmountable. ... All such interpretations strike me as attempts
to conform the Bible to conclusions drawn elsewhere ... If the meaning of
Scripture is distorted to fit scientific opinion, its authority has been
relinquished. ... This is not to deny that it is difficult at present to
harmonize some of the scientific data with a recent-creation interpretation of
Scripture." (<a href="#Camp1999">Camp 1999</a>, p. 42-43) </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> It is also difficult to reconcile Camp's statement that "I find that the
same evidence points to something entirely different" with "it is difficult at
present to harmonize some of the scientific data with a recent-creation
interpretation of Scripture." </p>

<p> Perhaps, then, even Mr. Camp agrees that his critique is not based in
scientific evidence?<br /> </p>

<a id="footnote1" name="footnote1"></a>
<p> 1. As an aside, Camp has misplaced the above Denton quote. To be fair,
Denton made that remark in response to the controversial "molecular clock"
hypothesis, which is related though distinctly different from the observation
of equal molecular divergences between species. From his later comments, Camp
evidently does not understand this difference. The molecular clock hypothesis
is the idea that rates of evolution are constant throughout time. Rates could
be extremely variable yet result in equal genetic distance between two species
serendipitously. Conversely, rates could be very constant in specific lineages,
yet result in unequal genetic distances (if the rates are unequal between
lineages). Regardless, Denton is still confused on the subject, as he
uncritically assumes that absolute background mutation rates in yeast should be
"100,000 times greater than in a tree or a mammal ..." (<a
href="#Denton1998">Denton 1998</a>, p. 291-292). This would only be true if DNA
replication errors were the primary source of mutations. However, there is
currently little data supporting this directly. Recent studies have indicated
that other sources of mutation are more important (<a
href="#Huttley_etal2000">Huttely et al. 2000</a>; <a
href="#Bohossian_etal2000">Bohossian et al. 2000</a>; <a
href="#KumarSubramanian2002">Kumar and Subramanian 2002</a>). All else equal,
we expect that absolute background mutation rates should be equivalent between
species, and that is roughly what is observed. Even if DNA replication errors
are the primary cause of mutations, from the most basic conclusions of neutral
theory there are other reasons (beyond the scope of this rebuttal) for why
rates of protein evolution should be relatively equal between organisms with
very short or very long generation times (see <a href="#Ohta1993">Ohta 1993</a>
and references therein - this article gives the consensus explanation which
Denton claims does not exist, and it demonstrates that the evidence supports
this explanation). <a href="#footnote1back"><i><b>Back</b></i></a> </p>

<a id="footnote2" name="footnote2"></a> <p> 2. Camp is incorrect here in his
assessment that stratigraphy bears upon whether an organism is considered a
transitional form or not. A transitional form is defined purely in terms of
morphology, regardless of age. Additionally, Camp's quote of Cracraft is
horribly out-of-context due to the ellipses. The quote originally read - "Part
of the confusion apparent in the scientific literature and the religious
writings of the creationists, I suggest, stems from the definition of
'transitional form.'" (<a href="#Cracraft1984">Cracraft 1984</a>) <a
href="#footnote2back"><i><b>Back</b></i></a></p>

<a id="footnote3" name="footnote3"></a> <p> 3. Kurt Wise is extremely honest,
and, of all the "scientific creationists," Wise bears both the best credentials
and the best of reputations. Wise has admittedly relinquished all pretense of
scientific objectivity, as he does not trust science to accurately represent
reality. Wise has written: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Although there are scientific reasons for accepting a young earth, I am a
young-age creationist because that is my understanding of the Scripture. As I
shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence
in the universe turns against creationism, I would be the first to admit it,
but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems
to indicate. Here I must stand." (<a href="#Wise2001">Wise 2001</a>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> As such, Wise holds certain "hypotheses" (including a very narrow and
theologically questionable interpretation of Scripture) which he will believe
even though all evidence indicates otherwise. Such statements, supposedly
coming from a scientist in a profession which necessarily holds all conclusions
as provisional and open to further testing, certainly indicates that there is
no reason to trust the validity of any unpublished, unreviewed "analyses"
performed by this man. In light of the fact that Mr. Camp is fond of quoting
"creation scientists" like Duane Gish, Lee Spetner, Walter ReMine, and "John
Woodmorappe," another honest statement by young-earth creationist Wise is
pertinent here: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Most creation science is garbage" (quoted in an interview in <a
href="http://a-s.clayton.edu/criticalthinking/Harper's%20Mag%20on%
20creationism.htm">Hitt 1996</a>). </p>

</blockquote>

<p> Wise has expounded: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> "This gets me in a lot of trouble with a lot of creationists, ... the
material that's out there is - uh, I'll hold back and be nice - garbage. It's
really atrocious" (quoted by <a
href="http://www.weeklywire.com/ww/05-18-98/knox_feat.html"> Mayshark
1998</a>). </p>
