    <p>BRIGHTON and Hove Albion have, at different times in their 98-year history, also been
    known as United and Rangers - but they have never been happy Wanderers. Today, however,
    their nomadic existence of recent seasons comes to an end when they return to the south
    coast after two years of exile in Gillingham, 70 miles away. </p>
    <p>For the first time since April 1997, Brighton are playing a home match - a pre-season
    game against Nottingham Forest - in one of the towns from which they take their name. They
    will be welcomed back by a capacity crowd of 6,000 at Withdean Stadium, a converted
    athletics venue, which they hope will tide them over until a permanent location can be
    made ready. </p>
    <p>The team left town to share Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium after a previous board of
    directors sold the Goldstone Ground, the club's home for 96 years, to pay off debts. But a
    return to its roots soon became an economic as well as an emotional necessity as crowds
    dwindled to 2,000 in Kent. &quot;A move back home was vital, even if it had been to play
    on a car park,&quot; Des Lynam, the club's most famous supporter, said. &quot;When they
    were playing at Gillingham, they were missed terribly.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Seagulls' landing at Withdean, though, was not without difficulties. Persuading
    Brighton and Hove council, the owners, to grant planning permission in the face of strong
    local opposition required the best efforts of club and supporters. It has also taken the
    best part of a year and a seven-figure sum to bring the stadium, which held only 1,000, up
    to Football League standards - and it is still far from ideal. </p>
    <p>The running track means that spectators will be some way further away from the action
    than they would like and most of them will get drenched in wet weather, for the majority
    of seats are uncovered. The areas behind the goals are empty apart from the odd
    Portakabin. More-over, the council's need to mollify objectors forced them to impose
    stringent restrictions. </p>
    <p>'A move back was seen as vital, even if it had only been for them to play on a car
    park' The club was told to discourage the use of cars, which meant the provision of
    park-and-ride facilities and the inclusion of travel vouchers for use on local buses and
    trains with match tickets. Amplified music is banned, with the sole exception of the
    club's anthem, Sussex By</p>
    <p>The Sea, calling for ingenuity on the part of the announcers, one of whom, John Baine,
    alias Attila the Stockbroker, has become the club's poet-in-residence. On the other hand,
    Withdean has undoubted attractions. The leafy environs are a refreshing change from the
    terraced housing and main roads that abound on most grounds. The wooded slope of a nature
    reserve rises behind the main bank of seating, opposite a mockTudor family pub, sadly
    closed on match days. </p>
    <p>Planning permission was granted initially for three years, one having already lapsed
    without a ball being kicked, emphasising the club's insistence that Withdean is only a
    stop-gap base. &quot;When the team steps out at our temporary home, it will be the
    culmination of a tremendous joint effort by the board and the fans to bring the club
    home,&quot; Dick Knight, the chairman, said. &quot;It is the start of a new era for the
    Albion, but only the start.&quot; </p>
    <p>Earlier this year, a local referendum resulted in a 68 per cent vote in favour of plans
    for a 25,000-seat stadium at Falmer, on the eastern outskirts of Brighton. This site, also
    council-owned, is close to a railway station and the main A27, but is in an area
    technically designated as one of outstanding natural beauty. </p>
    <p>The club is confident of local authority support and that the project can be funded,
    but plans certainly will be called in by the Department of the Environment, with 2003 the
    earliest completion date being mentioned. </p>
    <p>For now, supporters, who faced journeys of at least two hours on four different
    motorways to get to fixtures at Gillingham, are content simply to be able to leave home
    after lunch to attend home games. Regular sell-outs are expected, especially if Micky
    Adams, the manager, can bring the sort of success that he achieved at Fulham. </p>
    <p>A play-off place is thought to be well within reach. Yet for many, simply being back in
    Sussex is enough. There is no need to apologise for reprising a three-year old cliché and
    reflect that, today, for followers of Brighton, football's coming home. </font></td>
