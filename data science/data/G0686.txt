    points of her lecture is that processing materials in the microgravity
    of space reduces defects like the spot, at the center of the
    model, where an extra row of atoms has wedged into the lattice.

    <P>Because astronauts are called upon to do a little of everything
    on the job, their training encompasses far more than how to operate
    the Space Shuttle or - with the new candidates in training -
    the International Space Station (ISS).</P>

    <P>Among the many fields astronauts must know is materials science
    in microgravity, one of the principal missions for ISS. Materials
    science research aboard the ISS is sponsored by the Microgravity
    Research Program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
    Ala. Approximately 60 percent of the planned science experiment
    time aboard ISS is devoted to the microgravity sciences and commercial
    microgravity investigations.</P>

    <P>&quot;This type of training is challenging because the astronauts
    have a range of backgrounds from mathematics to materials science,&quot;
    said Dr. Sharon Cobb, the project scientist for the Materials
    Sciences Research Facility here at NASA/Marshall. Cobb recently
    gave an introductory class, including hands-on labs, to the most
    recently selected astronaut candidate class at Johnson Space
    Center.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">&quot;I </FONT></B>gave an overview - with
    a number of essential details - of what materials science is
    and why we want to do this research in microgravity. Later the
    astronauts will get more detailed training on specific experiments
    as the hardware is developed for flight.&quot;</TD>

    <!--/NOEDIT-->Ironically, part of microgravity materials science
    originated with early space station programs. In the 1960s, engineers
    at NASA/Marshall and elsewhere wondered what would happen in
    space it they tried to weld together large parts of a spacecraft.
    Other engineers needed to know how liquid propellants would behave
    inside a rocket stage that was coasting between engine firings.</P>

    <P>From this came the realization that no one fully understood
    what would happen if gravity's effects were removed from materials
    that were liquefied, mixed, and resolidified. Early flight experiments
    were conducted aboard the last Apollo missions. The discipline
    grew and became a major aspect of Skylab's experiments in 1973-74,
    and a centerpiece of Space Shuttle and Spacelab missions during
    1983-98.</P>

    <P>Cobb reminded the astronaut candidates that advances in materials
    science in 1-g make their missions possible, from the new lithium-aluminum
    alloy that lightens the Shuttle External Tank so more payload
    mass can be carried to orbit, to the urethane-coated nylon pressure

    </TABLE>Today scientists work to be more analytical when designing
    new materials. But while their knowledge is highly refined, it
    is often limited by gravity's effects.</P>

    <P>Scientists have reached the point where a material's interactions
    with its container may alter sophisticated measurements of a
    property, or mask a fundamental phenomenon. For example, unavoidable
    convection - where warm, light fluids rise and cold, dense fluids
    sink - disturbs the formation of an alloy or electronics crystal
    and causes defects.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">G</FONT></B>ravity is an inescapable factor
    in the equations because it's always there - unless you go to
    orbit.</P>

    <P>Unless you go into orbit. You're still a captive of Earth's
    gravity - that's what holds you and the Moon in orbit - but you're
    falling continually so the effect is indistinguishable from gravity
    being turned off. Tiny residual accelerations remain, so scientists
    refer to microgravity, not zero-G.</P>

    <P>The net result is that a new range of possibilities now opens
    for materials science.</P>

    <P>&quot;The goal of materials processing in space is to develop
    a better understanding of the relationship between processing,
    structure, and properties so that we can reliably predict the
    conditions required on Earth to achieve desired materials properties,&quot;

    heating where the hot zone travels down the length of a sample,
    followed by a cool-down zone. Others provide for rapid quench,
    like dipping a hot horseshoe in a bucket of water, to freeze

            in International Standard Payload Racks (ISPR) such as the one
            being inspected at right. The racks are designed to hold virtually
            everything on ISS, including furnaces and support equipment for
            materials science experiments. Top image links to <A HREF="images/ms101/station.jpg">900x600-pixel,

    <P>Cobb gave the astronaut candidates a little practice in these
    areas with some basic experiments that parallel what is done
    in classrooms and in space. In one demonstration, the candidates
    grew crystals of succinonitrile, a chemical that forms dendrites,
    tree-like crystals, similar to what happens inside metals.</P>

    <P>Already, similar experiments aboard the Space Shuttle have
    caused scientists to rewrite some basic assumptions about what
    happens in that magical instant as a metal turns from liquid
    to solid. More advances are expected as the ISS is completed
    and becomes an orbiting materials laboratory.</TD>
