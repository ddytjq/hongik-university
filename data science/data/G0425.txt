<div class="mainheader">Quintessence: It Sounded Greek<br> Even to the Greeks</div>

<p>When it doubt, go back to the basics.  That's just what cosmologists have done to explain why our Universe seems to be accelerating.</p>

<p>The new buzz word in cosmology these days is "quintessence," borrowed from the ancient Greeks who used the term to describe a mysterious "fifth element" -- in addition to air, earth, fire and water -- which held the moon and stars in place.  Quintessence, some cosmologists say, is an exotic kind of energy field that pushes particles away from each other, at times overpowering gravity and the other fundamental forces.</p>

<p>If quintessence is real, it certainly wouldn't be rare.  Two-thirds of the Universe would be made of the stuff.  Recently, at the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics in Austin, Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University explained how quintessence became the dominating force in the Universe a few billion years ago.</p>

<p>Cosmology used to be a tranquil occupation.  As recent as two years ago, most folks were in agreement that, yes, the Universe is expanding.  At question was simply whether the expansion would slowly come to a halt and bring the Universe falling back in on itself, or whether the Universe would continue to float apart but at a slower and slower rate.  If there was enough matter in the Universe, then gravity would halt the expansion and suck all that we know into the "big crunch."  All cosmologists had to do was to add up the mass in the Universe.</p>

<p>But in 1998, cosmologists were shaken off their seats by the discovery that the Universe is expanding at an astonishing clip.  New and improved observations of distant supernovae were rendering the "big crunch" question null and void.</p> 

<p>Supernovae are star explosions, and there are a couple of varieties.  One, called a Type Ia supernova, explodes with a characteristic energy.  With a decent idea of the explosion's absolute and apparent brightness, astronomers can determine the distance to these objects.  Then, knowing the redshift, they can calculate how fast the supernovae are moving away from us.  Turns out that the most distant Type 1a supernovae are moving away much faster then closer ones, suggesting that the universe's expansion is actually accelerating, not decelerating.</p>  

<p>There are a few non-believers, with good cause.  Some say these most distant supernovae may just look far (that is, dim) because intervening dust scatters their light.  Also, we cannot be certain that the most distant supernovae explode in the same way as closer ones.</p>  

<p>Countering these arguments, however, is a recent Hubble observation by Adam Reiss (University of California, Berkeley) of the most distant supernova yet --  SN1997ff, far enough and early enough to be from an era when the Universe was decelerating.  All other supernovae we have seen are from the current era of universal acceleration.  The Hubble observation supports the notion that the Universe accelerated after the Big Bang, slowed down with the pull of gravity, and then inexplicably sped up again from the pull of dark energy.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein also wondered why the Universe didn't collapse on itself from the force of gravity.  He invented a "dark energy" force called the cosmological constant to repel gravity and keep the Universe static.  This was a fudge factor in his equations.  Good idea, but for the wrong reason.  Einstein, and everyone else in the early 20th century, thought the Universe was static and that everything was contained within the Milky Way galaxy.  The cosmological constant was an anti-gravity "vacuum" force that kept gravity from pulling the Universe in on itself.  By 1930, Edwin Hubble discovered that the Milky Way was but one of a multitude of galaxies and that the Universe was expanding.  So, there was no longer a need for a cosmological constant.  Einstein dropped the number from his equations, calling it his "greatest blunder".</p>

<p>Now this force that is accelerating the Universe is simply labeled "dark energy".  It has no definition beyond that.  To add some color to dark energy, some cosmologists are rethinking the cosmological constant idea.</p>  

<p>Steinhardt passes on the notion that dark energy is the cosmological constant.  He opts instead for quintessence, a word he re-introduced and a concept he and his colleagues developed.  Some of the brightest brains in the business are on Steinhardt's side, including famed Princeton physicist Jeremiah Ostriker and Lawrence M. Krauss, Chairman of the department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University.</p>

<p>The problem with the cosmological constant, Steinhardt says, is that it is indeed constant.  It yields the same force throughout time.  Observational evidence indicates that whatever this force is that is accelerating the Universe, it hasn't been constant over time.  There had to be periods when the force was negligible, otherwise stars and planets and chipmunks never would have formed.</p>

<p>"The cosmological constant is a very specific form of energy, a vacuum energy," Steinhardt said.  "Quintessence encompasses a wide class of possibilities.  It is a dynamic, time-evolving and spatially dependent form of energy with negative pressure sufficient to drive the accelerating expansion."</p>

<p>Vacuum energy is the potential energy in an absolute vacuum, devoid of matter or radiation.  Think of a chimney sucking air from the living room; that's the universe's matter expanding into the great unknown.  Quintessence is a quantum field with both kinetic and potential energy.  Depending in the ratio of the two energies and the pressure they exert, quintessence can either attract or repel.</p>

<p>Quintessence became a force to be reckoned with about 10 billion years ago, according to the theory.  That may seem rather early on in a 15 billion-year-old Universe, but cosmologist don't see it that way.  The dark energy was created when the Universe was 10<sup>-35</sup> second old; it did not cause the Universe to accelerate for another five billion years.  That's a factor of more that 10<sup>50</sup> -- and relatively recently in terms of redshift and the size of the Universe.</p>

<p>Steinhardt suggests that quintessence turned on during the transition from a radiation- to matter-dominated Universe, when it was cool enough for atoms and eventually stars to form.</p>

<p>But what is quintessence made of?  No one knows for sure.  Radiation, ordinary matter and likely dark matter all have positive pressure.  They therefore exert a gravitationally attractive force.  Anything with negative pressure, the general theory of relativity dictates, would have a gravitationally repulsive force.</p>

<p>For quintessence, the quantum field would have a very long wavelength, about the size of the Universe.  Its kinetic energy depends on the rate of oscillations in the field strength; its potential energy depends on the interaction of the field with matter.  The more kinetic energy, the more positive the pressure -- which isn't so likely for a universe-long wavelength.  So for now, potential energy and negative pressure dominates.  Hence, quintessence is a repulsive force.</p>

<p>This can change, Steinhardt says.  Quintessence interacts with matter and evolves over time.  Quintessence can also decay into new forms of hot matter or radiation.  So we are not necessarily doomed to a Universe that expands forever, stretching every atom from here to infinity.</p>  

<p>Sounds nice, but not everyone is sold.</p>

<p>"The theory of the accelerating Universe is a work in progress," says James Peebles, professor emeritus at Princeton University.  "I admire the architecture, but I would not want to move in just yet."</p>

<p>Indeed, at the Texas Symposium, polite arguments over quintessence stretched well into the next talk.  Some suggested that the nature of dark energy would become clear with a better understanding of gravity and gravitational waves.  Steinhardt was admittedly at a loss with some of the questions.  Astronomers and cosmologists are intrigued by quintessence; they simple need more details.</p>

<p>We won't be able to hold quintessence in our hands; nor can we create probes to detect it directly.  At best, we need instruments that can determine that effect of quintessence on the Universe over time.</p> 

<p>The Supernova Acceleration Project (SNAP), a proposed space mission, would systematically search for large numbers of distant supernovae, beyond the reach of most land-based telescopes.  Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who also spoke at the Texas meeting, is leading the effort and described a not-so-complicated satellite with a two-meter telescope dedicated to finding supernovae at high redshift.  SNAP would find about 2,000 supernovae a year, enough to significantly close the error bars on calculations of the universe's rate of expansion.  The mission is not yet funded.</p>

<p>The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) has already launched and is on its way to determining the ratio of ordinary matter to that of dark matter and dark energy.  MAP may detect small variations in the amount of quintessence across the sky as seen in ripples in the microwave background, remnant radiation from when the Universe was 400,000 years old.  Chuck Bennett, a MAP project leader at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, is rather excited.</p>

<p>"MAP is the best way to test quintessence in the immediate future," Bennett said.  "Quintessence makes very specific predictions.  To see if it is there or not is a no brainer.  To get an exact value, well, that's a little harder."</p>

<p>At issue is how well MAP can measure the factors in the quintessence equation, such as the mass density of the Universe, its geometry and rate of expansion, and the neutrino contribution.</p>

<p>Steinhardt certainly has a good track record.  He was one of the originators of the inflation theory and predicted an accelerating Universe back in 1995.  If quintessence does prove to be something that scientists can sink their teeth into, it would be yet another confirmation of Einstein's theories, as well as a fine nod to the ancient Greeks who sent us down this path.</p>
