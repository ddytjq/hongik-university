<P>
Apart from the Big Bang, the disintegration of massive stars into
supernova (SN) explosions are the energetically most
violent short-lived phenomena in the universe. During the supernova 
explosion, the gravitational binding energy of the entire star is released 
within a few seconds. Hence, SNe are spectacular events especially in the optical,
sometimes brighter than an entire galaxy over periods of weeks.
<P>
The interaction of the expanding supernova shell with circumstellar matter, 
however, gives radiation predominantly in the X-ray range. 
In order to conclude on the physics of this interaction, we perform X-ray 
observations of both known X-ray bright and previously unknown supernovae 
with orbiting X-ray observatories. Previous studies with the 
<a href="http://wave.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat">ROSAT</a> satellite
included the supernovae 1979C, 1993J and 1994I. With our ongoing program to
monitor the X-ray emission from a number of supernovae, and given the superior 
spatial and spectral capabilities of the <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/">
Chandra</a> and <a href="http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/">XMM-Newton</a> observatories, 
we expect a significant breakthrough in understanding one of the most
violent processes in the universe.
<P>
From the analysis of the X-ray emission, we can derive the amount of the pre-supernova 
mass loss rate as well as the density and velocity profile including element 
abundances of the supernova ejecta. The most likely X-ray emission mechanism
is thermal radiation from the collision of the high velocity
supernova gas with mass lost from the progenitor star prior to the
explosion. This interaction produces a fast shock wave in the circumstellar 
wind and a reverse shock wave into the outer supernova ejecta. 
The shocked region is a likely site for radio, late-time optical, ultraviolet, 
and, most importantly, X-ray emission.
