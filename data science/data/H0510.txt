<br clear="all"><br> Pieces of shale shift under Walter Fontana's boots as he hikes to the top of a
ridge south of Belen, New Mexico. The young scientist's intention is to leap off
that ridge, but he won't fall straight to the ground. Instead he'll stay
suspended by a device called a paraglider while he plays among the rising and
failing currents of air generated by interactions of sun, earth, and moisture.

The sport is dangerous, but a quote favored by Fontana explains his passion for
it:  "Flying gives me a chance to understand systems, to discover how things fit
together." On a lighter note, he adds, "Now and then, it's good to get away from
it all."
</p>
<p>
It's fair to say that what Fontana does for relaxation in the air--intuitively
trying to understand the emergence of a system of self-sustaining updrafts--he
does more formally as a research professor in residence at the Santa Fe
Institute, though at the molecular level. Using research from a variety of
fields, he strives to achieve new heights of understanding.

<small>A string of symbols (denoting molecular building blocks) represents an RNA
sequence or primary structure (right). Each symbol likes to pair up with a
specific other symbol. The result is a pattern of pairings, a so-called secondary
structure (left), that is lowest in energy. The drawing should not be read as a
two-dimensional spatial structure, but rather as a representation of which
position is connected to which. The actual three-dimensional, or tertiary,
structure (top) includes a further layer of interactions beyond pairing.

Particularly, he seeks to understand how self-sustaining chemical systems emerge,
and to develop a formal method to classify their possible changes. "I want to
understand the emergence of molecular organization.  Why can't we understand with
our present formal tools the products of evolution?" he asks rhetorically in his
softly accented voice.
</p>
<p>
Darwinian selection may explain which of two alternative molecular systems will
come to dominate an environment under certain conditions, Fontana says, but it
cannot explain how these alternatives originated in the first place, nor offer a
complete spectrum of what else could have been possible.
</p>
<p>
Fontana's interest in the emergence of self-sustaining molecular systems itself
emerged from a series of earlier interests, in particular from a much simpler
case in which he studied the effect of mutations on the structure of RNA
(ribonucleic acid) molecules. This was at the University of Vienna, where he
received his doctorate in theoretical chemistry in 1987 and is currently an
associate professor.
</p>
<p>
"RNA is so far the only molecule with which chemists can play Darwinian evolution
in the test tube," says Fontana. RNA molecules consist of four building blocks
linked like pearls on a string in any order and in multiple appearances. Changing
their order means that the molecules may fold into shapes that convey new
chemical functions.
</p>
<p>
It was, in fact, RNA that initially dispelled Fontana's prejudice that chemistry
was dull. In high school, he learned from The Eighth Day of Creation, (a detailed
history of early research in molecular biology by Horace Freeland Judson) that
RNA could form a reverse copy, like the negative of a photo, of DNA. When Fontana
learned this, he dropped his ideas of majoring in liberal arts.
</p>
<p>
"When I realized molecules could read, my awe was without bounds," he says of the
marvels of molecular translation and regulation.
</p>
<p><img src="images/cards.gif" align="right" width="288" height="375" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4">
But Fontana's initial training in complexity began even earlier, in his childhood
home in the South Tyrol, a formerly Austrian region governed by Italy since the
end of World War I. There, he spoke only German to his mother and only Italian to
his father. He and his father, a court of appeals judge, would lay out networks
of cardboard dominoes-some bent along the long axis in the shape of a V-on his
father's office floor. A single, falling, V-shaped cardboard could commence the
falling of two branching parallel chains of dominoes that would, perhaps,
intersect later and, perhaps, partially cancel the "falling domino" effect. Using
several V-shaped dominoes, more chains could be set in motion. Networks and
parallelism have fascinated Fontana ever since.
</p>
<p>
As a researcher, he and his colleagues Peter Schuster, Ivo Hofacker, and Peter
Stadler-all at the University of Vienna's Institute of Theoretical Chemistry-were
able to improve upon an already existing folding algorithm to predict the shapes
of RNA sequences. The package Fontana helped develop, commonly called the Vienna
RNA Package, is free software and is maintained and updated at the university. It
has become a widely used program around the world to predict the folding of RNA
molecules.
</p>
<p>
RNA is of particular interest to the public right now as a means of developing
substances that perform new chemical functions. In this process it is possible to
let Darwinian evolution in the test-tube do the work of generating molecules that
perform certain tasks-a practice called evolutionary biotechnology-rather than
attempting to rationally (and often hopelessly) construct "designer molecules" at
the drawing board.
</p>
<p>
"What enables the evolution of RNA strings is [a quality called] neutrality,"
says Fontana. "Think in terms of an electric circuit metaphor: an RNA sequence is
the wiring diagram, and its shape is the diagram's electronic behavior. You never
can change the behavior directly; all you can do is change the wiring diagram.
Many changes in the wiring diagram do not affect behavior and thus are considered
'neutral.' So," says Fontana, "if you want to change a given behavior into
something else not readily accessible from the current wiring diagram, you can;
the evolutionary process is not stuck. The current wiring diagram may still be
modified 'neutrally' again and again without destroying its behavior until
eventually the next change produces the new, improved behavior."
</p>
<p>
While Fontana's RNA research continued, he also began to wonder in the early
1990s about how to formalize chemistry so as to capture its generative aspect-the
capacity of molecules to construct new molecules upon interaction. Together with
Leo Buss, a biologist from Yale, he hopes in this way to understand how entire
networks of molecular reactions arise, how they become functionally organized,
and how a network defines the ways it can change.

This is a compilation of difficult changes in RNA secondary structure.
Difficult and easy changes are indicated with black and brown arrows, respectively. 
The point is that difficult change requires the synchronized participation of many
positions along the sequence.

A series of changing sequences and their structures are shown. The question is:
what constitutes "dramatic change"? An evolutionary meaningful definition of
"dramatic change" is "a change that is difficult to make on average." Each
sequence in the series results from the previous by changing the symbol at one
position. Clearly, there is no "dramatic change" at the level of sequences.
Contrary to appearance, however, it turns out that the first change in structure
is "dramatic" (a shift), while the next (loss of a structural element) is not.
The difficulty of a change has nothing to do with similarity.

"I wanted to go beyond chemical kinetics, which assumes that a particular
reaction network already exists. I wanted to get at the core of chemistry proper:
how does a network build itself? What are possible architectures for
self-sustaining networks of chemical production and coordination?" he asks.
</p>
<p>
So he set up what he calls "a toy world," in which mathematical formalisms
represent an abstract, very simplified, chemical world. "I try to get rid of
everything in the real world that is not the core of the problem." He adds with a
helpless smile, "Naturally, this will offend some chemists."
</p>
<p>
The right simplifications are at the basis of important abstractions. Consider
how Newton discarded major topographic features of planets to develop a theory of
gravitation that treats physical objects only as mathematical points of mass
attracting each other. Sacrificing hills and valleys, and oceans and sands for a
useful abstraction, now makes it possible to plot the trajectories of
interplanetary voyages.
</p>
<p>
The physicist George Gamow used the same idea of helpful simplification in 1953
when he attempted to use then-known features of DNA to mathematicize the
hereditary properties of living organisms as a long number written in a
four-digit system. As physicist and biochemist Francis Crick states in The Eighth
Day of Creation, the importance of Gamow's idea "was that it was really an
abstract theory of coding, and was not cluttered up with a lot of unnecessary
chemical details."
</p>
<p>
But the question arises, how can one achieve a simplified, self-maintaining
system that would accurately represent the relevant features of an organization
even more primitive than any in reality? The goal, of course, was clear. Fontana
wrote in a recent research proposal of his intention to develop a mathematical
understanding of self-maintaining organizations, that "there exists no readily
identifiable scientific tradition that seeks to understand what classes of such
systems are possible or to discover conditions necessary to achieve them."
</p>
<p>
So Fontana was like a person trying to learn to ride a bike when the bike had yet
to be invented. Unlike, say, the formal relation developed by Einstein between
mass and energy, there existed no formal mathematics to describe how complex
systems originate from simpler ones. Without that basic understanding, it was
impossible to predict in what ways such networks could change, and how novelty
arises in evolution. Why, say, does a cell without a nucleus become a cell with a
nucleus, or why do cells band together to form tissues with specialized
functions? And what happens when such a molecular system is perturbed by some
unexpected element, another molecular organization, or some other intruder?
</p>
<p>
Fontana offers a simplified handle on his thoughts by discussing evolution. "Have
you ever considered what is chance and what is really necessary in the process of
evolution?" he asks. "What would happen if we reran the tape, so to speak, and
started over again? Would the process end up with the same results-the biological
world as it appears to us today-or would things work out differently? Is today's
world a completely random event, or would certain aspects have to reoccur once
particular building blocks become available? The answer," he says, "is that we
don't know. Our science hits a wall. We suddenly realize that our tools-the
formal mathematics with which physics is so successful-seem not to have a grip on
this kind of question."
</p>
<p>
The question is fundamental, he says, because traditional dynamical systems
approaches are geared to treat change only in some quantitative observable, such
as position or density. But in a chemical reaction it is the "things"
themselves-the molecules-that change in a chemical transformation, not just some
numerical quantities associated with them. "This causes things that haven't been
there before to join the stage. These are new variables," says Fontana.
</p>
<p>
Conventional dynamical systems in use in physics do not have a form that allows
treating this situation. Fortunately, he says, he found a tool that enabled him
to at least produce a "toy model"-a theory of computation that offered a new
perspective, since it is, loosely speaking, based on the transformations that
objects can undergo. This tool is the lambda calculus invented by Princeton's
Alonzo Church in the 1930s, and introduced to Fontana in a seminar at Los Alamos
National Laboratory by MIT mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota in the early 1990s. The
salient feature of this calculus is that it treats objects-symbolic
expressions-as functions that can act on these very same objects, transforming
them into new functions.
</p>
<p>
"I was amazed by this calculus. It looked chemical to me," says Fontana. "But for
my purposes, it was half-baked. It had to be animated with some dynamics." He
implemented a computer program based on the calculus. Its purpose was to study
the behavior of a soup of such functions viewed as abstract molecules. He left
the program working overnight. When he returned the next morning, he found a
self-maintaining system.
</p>
<p>
"This was so interesting in itself that at first I didn't care if it had any
application. I took for the first time seriously the idea of molecules as
functions. I came to see molecules as themselves rules of interaction, as agents
of transformation that act on other molecules to become new agents of
transformation," he says.
</p>
<p>
In Berlin, Fontana had a conversation on the subject with the well-known
molecular biologist Gunter Stent. At first, Stent did not grasp Fontana's point,
but later he approached Fontana to say, "I see, you are making a distinction
between having a function and being a function. Your molecules are functions to
begin with."
</p>
<p>
Fontana was aware, however, that his insight-while a step forward-had still left
him far from the solution he sought. Lambda calculus is not real chemistry.
"There are many problems. For example, there is no notion of mass, or mass
conservation, in this calculus.  And in the world of computational logic, there
is no sensitivity to resources: everything can be used indefinitely; nothing is
ever used up; everything goes on forever. However, in chemistry, if I use a
molecule A to prove by synthesis a molecule C, A is gone, and needs to be
produced again.
</p>
<p>
"But we may find a new calculus. I'm dreaming, but this is what drives me."
</p>
<p>
However, Fontana mentions one source of encouragement: "As we try to modify
lambda calculus towards a better chemistry, we end up with problems that have
already arisen in computer science for completely different reasons. There is a
kind of convergence."
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, at SFI, Fontana has used his verbal skills and understanding of the
invisible links between complex systems to be helpful to social scientists.
</p>
<p>
SFI visiting fellow David Stark, chair of the Department of Sociology at Columbia
University, was interested in how organizations succeed by "exploitation" (the
mining of known resources) and "exploration" (seeking new resources). Describing
his discussion with Fontana, he says, "Walter Fontana is one of the most
incredible intellectuals I've ever met. That he could talk with people outside
his field and explain to them, in terms they can grasp, without condescending or
short-circuiting the idea, the complicated processes he was analyzing in his RNA
work, was amazing.
</p>
<p>
"Walter, says Stark, "shifted the discussion down to the level of genetic
mutation and showed [that the notion of exploit versus explore] was a false
dichotomy: in order to have direction-a focus to exploit resources, you need
drift-apparently aimless exploration." This would be the equivalent of the many
seemingly useless, or neutral, changes in RNA structure that, without warning,
create the configuration of a valuable new molecule. "Such movement [apparently]
isn't leading you anywhere, but without it, you're not going anywhere."
</p>
<p>
Says John Padgett, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, "Walter is
interested in the folding in of chemical networks to get a self-sustaining system
called a metabolism. If you look at my networks on marriage and economics in
medieval Florence, pictorially there's a great similarity between his pictures
and mine, though his are chemical and mine social. Mine fold in to produce
political parties.
</p>
<p><img src="images/hanger_2.gif" align=left border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4">
"So, because I'm looking for self-sustaining mechanisms, I've taken his models
and used them for medieval Florence, because complex systems in a formal
sense--like Walter does them--can have a number of trajectories. My environmental
perturbations are goals and alliances; I know what Florence did, but not the
possible histories, or why Florence became different from Venice."
</p>
<p>
South of Belen, Fontana has made it to the mountain's top.  Methodically, he
removes his paraglider from his pack. As the breeze catches the unusual device,
it folds out into the shape of a cathedral arch.
</p>
<p>
Fontana takes off with his feet tucked. Then his legs push forward like a child
pumping in a swing. Fully launched, he could be riding a flying scooter in an
amusement park in which one is whirled round and round a center stanchion, but
here, there is no stanchion, only variations in wind and one's skill in riding
it.  He controls the craft by shifting his weight and manipulating some of the
many lines connected in four suites to the trailing edge of the sail.
</p>
<p>
The average flight time at this site, for fellow excursionists also gliding,
seems about 10 minutes.  However, 15 minutes later, everyone else is down, but
Fontana is still sailing. Turning, dropping, rising, he intuitively rides the
complex currents of air. In another 10 minutes, the other paraglide devotees and
spectators motor off to lunch.
</p>
<p>
Fontana is still flying, alone above the ridge.
</p>
<p>
Twenty minutes later, small against the wide blue sky, Fontana still soars,
intuitively riding the thermals that appear and fail in some complex interaction
of sun angle and ground and moisture.
</p>
<p>
He loses updraft, begins to fall.  But hugging the cliff face almost close enough
to count pebbles, Fontana locates a thermal and is again aloft above the
ridgeline.
