<H2>What are topological defects?</H2>

<P>Topological defects are stable configurations of matter formed at <A HREF="cs_phase.html">phase
transitions </A>in the very early universe. These configurations are in
the original, symmetric or old phase, but nevertheless they persist after
a phase transition to the asymmetric or new phase is completed. There are
a number of possible types of defects, such as <A HREF="#walls">domain
walls</A>, <A HREF="#strings">cosmic strings</A>, <A HREF="#monopoles">monopoles</A>,
<A HREF="#textures">textures </A>and other `hybrid' creatures. The type
of defect formed is determined by the symmetry properties of the matter
and the nature of the phase transition. <BR>
<BR>
Below you can find a brief description of each type of defect: </P>

<H3><A NAME="walls"></A>Domain walls:</H3>

<P>These are two-dimensional objects that form when a <B>discrete symmetry</B>
is broken at a phase transition. A network of domain walls effectively
partitions the universe into various `cells'. Domain walls have some rather
peculiar properties. For example, the gravitational field of a domain wall
is repulsive rather than attractive. </P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Domain walls are associated with models in which there
is more than one separated mimimum.</I></H5>

<H3><A NAME="strings"></A>Cosmic strings:</H3>

<P>These are one-dimensional (that is, line-like) objects which form when
an <B>axial</B> or <B>cylindrical </B>symmetry is broken. Strings can be
associated with grand unified particle physics models, or they can form
at the electroweak scale. They are very thin and may stretch across the
visible universe. A typical GUT string has a thickness that is less then
a trillion times smaller that the radius of an Hydrogen atom. Still, a
10 km lenght of one such string will weigh as much as the earth itself!</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Cosmic strings are associated with models in which the
set of minima are not simply-connected, that is, the vacuum manifold has
`holes' in it. The minimum energy states on the left form a circle and
the string corresponds to a non-trivial winding around this.</H5>

<H3><A NAME="monopoles"></A>Monopoles:</H3>

<P>These are zero-dimensional (point-like) objects which form when a <B>spherical
</B>symmetry is broken. Monopoles are predicted to be supermassive and
carry magnetic charge. The existence of monopoles is an inevitable prediction
of grand unified theories (GUTs); this is one of the puzzles of the standard
cosmology. </P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Only the three-dimensional `hedgehog' configuration
on the left corresponds to a monopole.</I></H5>

<H3><A NAME="textures"></A>Textures:</H3>

<P>These form when larger, more complicated symmetry groups are completely
broken. Textures are delocalized topological defects which are unstable
to collapse. The potential cosmological implications of textures are described
<A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/cs_text.html">here</A>.</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Examples of delocalized texture configurations in one
and two dimensions.</I><BR>
</H5>

<H2><A NAME="condmat"></A>Have they been seen?</H2>

<P>Due to their extremely high energies, cosmological defects have not
yet been detected, and it is virtually impossible to produce them, even
in the most powerful particle accelerators. On the other hand, this is
one of the reasons why people are interested in them - if they can be found
today, they will be a unique direct link to the physics of the first moments
of the universe. Some observational searches are already under way!<BR>
<BR>
However, defects are not exclusive of the early universe! they exist and
have been studied in a wide variety of more `down-to-earth' contexts. In
the laboratory, topological defects are commonly observed in <B>condensed
matter systems.</B> Simple examples are the domains in a ferromagnet; regions
in which the magnetic dipoles are aligned, separated by domain walls. <B>Liquid
crystals</B> exhibit an array of topological defects, such as strings and
monopoles. Defects can also been found in biochemistry, notably in the
procees of <B>protein folding</B>.<BR>
<BR>
As an example, here are two <B>photographs</B> (obtained with an optical
microscope)&nbsp;of strings in a nematic liquid crystal (<I>from I.Chuang
et. al., 1991)</I>:</P>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+0>You might want to refer back to these for comparison when
we describe <A HREF="cs_interact.html">the evolution of the strings in
the cosmological context</A>...</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<H2>Why do they form?</H2>

<P>If cosmic strings or other topological defects <I>can </I>form at a
cosmological phase transition then they <I>will</I> form. This as first
pointed out by Kibble and, in a cosmological context, the defect formation
process is known as the <B>Kibble mechanism</B>. <BR>
<BR>
The simple fact is that causal effects in the early universe can only propagate
(as at any time) as the speed of light c. This means that at a time t,
regions of the universe separated by more than a distance <I>d=ct </I>can
know nothing about each other. In a symmetry breaking phase transition,
different regions of the universe will choose to fall into different minima
in the set of possible states (this set is known to mathematicians as the
vacuum manifold). Topological defects are precisely the `boundaries' between
these regions with different choices of minima, and their formation is
therefore an inevitable consequence of the fact that differentregions cannot
agree on their choices.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in a theory with two minima, plus + and minus -, then neighbouring
regions separated by more than ct will tend to fall randomly into the different
states (as shown below). Interpolating between these different minima will
be a <A HREF="#walls">domain wall</A>.</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>The Kibble mechanism for the formation of domain walls.</I></H5>

<P><A HREF="#strings">Cosmic strings</A> will arise in slightly more complicated
theories in which the minimum energy states possess `holes'. The strings
will simply correspond to non-trivial `windings' around these holes (as
illustrated below).</P>

<DL>
<H2><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Why do we want to study them?</FONT></H2>

<P>Because, as we pointed out above, they provide a unique link to the
physics of the very early universe. Furthermore, they can crucially affect
the evolution of the universe! So given that they must necessarily form,
their study is an unavoidable part of any serious attempt to understand
the early universe.</P>

<P>The detailed consequences very with the type of defect considered. On
one hand, <A HREF="#walls">domain walls </A>and <A HREF="#monopoles">monopoles</A>
are cosmologically catastrophic. Any cosmological model in which they form
will evolve in a way that contradicts the basic <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bb_pillars.html">observational
facts </A>that we know about the universe. Such models must therefore be
ruled out!<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, <A HREF="#strings">cosmic strings</A> and (possibly)
<A HREF="#textures">textures</A> are much more benign. Among other things,
they could be the `seeds' that led to the formation of the l<A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_home.html">arge-scale
structures</A> we observe today, as well as the anisotropies in the <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/cmbr_home.html">Cosmic
Microwave Background</A>. They could also be at the origin of some of the
`dark matter' of the universe.</P>

<P>However, before one can analyse all these scenarios, one should make
sure that one understands how strings <A HREF="cs_interact.html">evolve</A>. And
in order to do this, one must inevitably resort to <A HREF="cs_evol.html">numerical
simulations...</A></P>
