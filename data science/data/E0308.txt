<H1><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</H1>

<P>Perl is a weakly typed language, meaning that a &quot;variable&quot;
could hold many different forms of data. This is perfectly legal in Perl:</P>

<PRE>$var1 = &quot;3.14159&quot;;
$var1 += 7.0;
print &quot;$var1\n&quot;;         #prints 10.14159</PRE>

<P>Notice that $var1 was never declared as a variable of any type. It started
life as a string, then became a number in an arithmetic operation. If you
had wanted to concatenate 7.0 on the end instead of adding it, here's what
you would have done:</P>

<PRE>$var1 = &quot;3.14159&quot;;
$var1 = &quot;$var1&quot; . &quot;7.0&quot;;
print &quot;$var1\n&quot;;         #prints 3.141597.0</PRE>

<P>The advantage of weak typing is it saves many intermediate steps. No
more declaring variables. No more variable conversion (itoa(), atoi(),
etc). No more using 2 different variables for the same thing just because
it's expressed in different formats. Of course, theres a price.</P>

<P>Without type checking, logical errors get a &quot;social promotion&quot;
to the runtime, where if you're lucky there will be a runtime error. More
likely, there will simply be hard to catch faulty output. Check this out:</P>

<PRE>$salaryBudget = 440000.00;  #amount before benefits
$partsBudget = 10000.00;
$totalBudget = 1.5 * $salaryBudget + $partsbudget; #note wrong capitalization of partsBudget
print $totalBudget\n;    #prints 660000.00, should print 670000.00.</PRE>

<P>C++ would never let you get away with this. The moment you compiled,
it would blow you off on undeclared partsbudget and you'd capitalize the
B. PERL, on the other hand, would merrily assign 0 to $partsbudget, and
add it to the rest. Such a small error might not be caught for months.</P>

<P>The moral of the story is to use some of the time you gained from weak
typing to check your work. You should also use the -w command line argument
when running PERL. This is kind of a Lint utility which will find obvious
errors like adding 10.0 to &quot;ABC&quot;, and slightly more subtle ones
like the uninitialized $partsbudget above.</P>

<P>All the variables in the above examples are scalar variables. PERL has
three kinds of variables: scalars, lists and hashes. All three are discussed
on this page.</P>

<H1><A NAME="VariablesDefaultGlobal"></A>Variables Default to Global</H1>

<P>No language is perfect. Perl's variables are global unless the programmer
specifically codes them as my($var). (There's also a hybrid local($var)
syntax which I won't describe).</P>

<P>Now here's the problem. Global variables are the kiss of death to any
app taking more than a few hours to code. They're a horrid violation of
encapsulation. Check this out:</P>

<PRE>sub getName
 {
 $name = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
 chomp($name);
 return($name);
 }

sub doLabel
 {
 print &quot;What is your name?==&gt;&quot;;
 $name = $getName();
 print &quot;\nWhat is your spouses name?==&gt;&quot;;
 $spousename = $getName();
 print &quot;\n&quot;;
 print PRINTERDEVICE &quot;Hi. I'm $name.\n&quot;;
 print PRINTERDEVICE &quot;My spouse is $spousename.\n&quot;;
 }</PRE>

<P>This program prints your spouse's name on *both* lines, because $name
is global, so the second<BR>
call to getName() resets global $name to your spouses name (after you typed
it in). To get the<BR>
program to act as intended, in subroutine getName() replace this:</P>

<PRE>$name = &lt;STDIN&gt;;</PRE>

<P>with this:</P>

<PRE>my($name) = &lt;STDIN&gt;;</PRE>

<P>Better yet, make them both local. I ALWAYS use the my($var) construct,
even if in fact the variable is at the top of the source file and global
to the program. You never know when what is presently the whole program
will become a large subroutine. The only time I don't use my($var) is when
$var is intended to be global and I want to document that fact.</P>

<P>Using my($var) is a great habit to get into. </P>

<H1><A NAME="Scalars"></A>Scalars</H1>

<P>A scalar is simply a variable which contains exactly one piece of information.
That information can be a string, a real, or an integer. It can even switch
between the above. But it contains only one piece of information. Lists
and hashes can contain multiple pieces of information.</P>

<P>Scalars ALWAYS start with a dollar sign ($). If you see a variable starting
with a dollar sign, and it does NOT have a subscript, it's a scalar. Scalars
were discussed pretty thoroughly in the <A HREF="#Introduction">introduction</A>.</P>

<P>Here are some scalar examples:</P>

<P>$circumference = 3.14159 * $diameter;<BR>
$wholename = &quot;$firstname $lastname&quot;;</P>

<H1><A NAME="Lists"></A>Lists</H1>

<P>Lists are just arrays. But imagine an array in a weakly typed language.
The elements don't need to be the same type. Some can be strings, some
numbers. The strings don't need to be the same length. Some of the numbers
can be floating point while others are integer.</P>

<P>If the elements of a list are the same type, it resembles an array in
C or C++. If the elements are of different types it probably makes more
sense to think of it like a struct in C or C++.</P>

<H5>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Note: List variables begin with an at sign (@). Single
elements of a list begin with a dollar sign ($) and have a subscript in
square brackets. Scalars begin with a dollar sign ($)&nbsp;and DO NOT have
a subscript. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H5>

<H2>Creating a List</H2>

<P>Lists can acquire their data in several ways. The list can be pre-declared
like this:</P>

<PRE>@daysOfWeek = (&quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Mon&quot;, &quot;Tue&quot;, &quot;Wed&quot;, &quot;Thur&quot;, &quot;Fri&quot;, &quot;Sat&quot;);</PRE>

<P>Lists can be initialized from the lines of a text file like this:</P>

<PRE>open(CONFIG, &quot;c:\\config.sys&quot;);
@configLines = &lt;CONFIG&gt;;</PRE>

<P>Lists can be assembled one element at a time:</P>

<PRE>#**** ADD TO THE END OF THE LIST ****
my(@kids);               #empty list
push(@kids, &quot;Brett&quot;);    #add to end of list
push(@kids, &quot;Rena&quot;);     #add to end of list
push(@kids, &quot;Valerie&quot;);  #add to end of list</PRE>

<PRE>#**** ADD TO THE START OF THE LIST ****
my(@cities);                          #empty list
unshift(@cities, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;);      #add to front of list
unshift(@cities, &quot;San Diego&quot;);        #add to front of list
unshift(@cities, &quot;Bakersfield&quot;);      #add to front of list
unshift(@cities, &quot;Riverside&quot;);        #add to front of list</PRE>

<P>Lists can be created from a string</P>

<PRE>$szCarCompanies = &quot;Chrysler,Ford,GM&quot;;
@carCompanies = split(/,/, $szCarCompanies);</PRE>

<H2>Using List Elements</H2>

<P>For the examples in this section, we're using the days of week list:</P>

<PRE>@daysOfWeek = (&quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Mon&quot;, &quot;Tue&quot;, &quot;Wed&quot;, &quot;Thur&quot;, &quot;Fri&quot;, &quot;Sat&quot;);</PRE>

<P>The simplest way to refer to an element is a subscript. Note the $ replaces
the @, and the subscript. Note that Sun's subscript is 0, not 1.</P>

<PRE>print &quot;$daysOfWeek[0];       #prints Sun
print &quot;$daysOfWeek[1];       #prints Mon
print &quot;$daysOfWeek[6];       #prints Sat
</PRE>

<P>You can remove the first element from a list and use it with the shift()
command:</P>

<PRE>#**** PRINT DAYS OF WEEK IN ORDER ****
while(@daysOfWeek)
  {
  print(shift(@daysOfWeek));
  print &quot;\n&quot;;
  }</PRE>

<P>You can remove the last element from a list and use it with the pop()
command:</P>

<PRE>#**** PRINT DAYS OF WEEK IN reverse ORDER ****
while(@daysOfWeek)
  {
  print(pop(@daysOfWeek));
  print &quot;\n&quot;;
  }</PRE>

<P>You can transform a list into a single string:</P>

<PRE>my($szDays) = join(&quot;...&quot;, @daysOfWeek);
print &quot;$szDays\n&quot;;   #prints all days, separated by elipses</PRE>

<H5>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Remember: List variables begin with an at sign (@). Single
elements of a list begin with a dollar sign ($) and have a subscript in
square brackets. Scalars begin with a dollar sign ($)&nbsp;and DO NOT have
a subscript. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H5>

<H1><A NAME="Hashes"></A>Hashes</H1>

<P>Hashes are associative arrays. They're two-dimensional arrays where
the first dimension is a &quot;key value&quot; whose purpose is to look
up the record. The second dimension is presumably the &quot;data&quot;.
</P>

<H5>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Note: Hash variables begin with a percent sign (%). TheSingle
elements of a hash begin with a dollar sign ($) and have a subscript in
curly brackets { }. Scalars begin with a dollar sign ($)&nbsp;and DO NOT
have a subscript.</H5>

<H5>A hash assignment is a comma delimited series of keys and values in
PARENTHESES (not curly brackets). Each key preceeds its value and is separated
from its value with =&gt; or a comma. For readability, the =&gt; is preferred.

<HR WIDTH="100%"></H5>

<H2><A NAME="CreatingHash"></A>Creating a Hash</H2>

<P>Hashes can acquire their data in several ways. The hash can be pre-declared
like this:</P>

<PRE>%officers = (&quot;president&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bill Clinton&quot;,&quot;vice president&quot;=&gt;&quot;Al Gore&quot;,
             &quot;intern&quot;=&gt;&quot;Monica Lewinsky&quot;);</PRE>

<P>Note that in the above the =&gt; symbols could have just as easily been
commas. The =&gt; is a substitute for readability purposes.</P>

<P>Hashes can be built an item at a time:</P>

<PRE>my(%officers);
$officers{&quot;president&quot;} = &quot;Bill Clinton&quot;;
$officers{&quot;vice president&quot;} = &quot;Al Gore&quot;;
$officers{&quot;intern&quot;} = &quot;Monica Lewinsky&quot;;
print $officers{&quot;vice president&quot;};  #this prints &quot;Al Gore&quot;</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="AccessingHashElements"></A>Accessing Hash Elements</H2>

<P>You can get an element by its key value:</P>

<PRE>print $officers{&quot;president&quot;};</PRE>

<P>You can get them in a loop:</P>

<PRE>while (($key, $val) = each(%officers))
    {print &quot;$key\t$val\n&quot;}</PRE>

<P>You can get all the key values:</P>

<PRE>@keys = keys(%officers);</PRE>

<P>You can get all the values:</P>

<PRE>#*** PRODUCE LIST SORTED BY NAME ***
@values = sort(values(%officers));</PRE>

<P>You can delete an item:</P>

<PRE>delete($officers{&quot;president&quot;});</PRE>
