<h1>Black holes by induction</h1>
<ul>Question:How do you go looking for something that is by nature
impossible
to see?<br>
Answer: By not looking for it!<br>
</ul>
From all that I have read or seen when astronomers say something is
suspected to be a black hole, it is not because they went looking for
extreme gravitational fields.  They label it 'black hole' because that's
the only thing it could possibly be---not star, not dead star, not a
combination of stars.  In Holmesian fashion astronomers eliminate the
impossible, and whatever's left, however improbable, is the solution.  I
gather that for a long time black holes were considered only in the
theoretical sense, as an astrophysicist's mental play-thing, instead of
something that could actually <i>exist</i> (especially so frequently).
When odd things turn up, such as supermassive yet very tiny brightly
glowing <i>things</i>, black holes rear their invisible heads as one of
the most viable explanations.
<p>
Why would someone shy away from saying an object is a black hole?  Well, I
admit that black holes are rather freaky.  If the event horizon isn't bad
enough, the singularity is.  Physicists aren't really sure what happens
<i>near</i> the singualrity, let alone in it.  Having an object with such
questionable parts be the cure-all answer to a tricky problem feels
almost...like an ad hoc explanation.  Perhaps it reminds astronomers of
the days when they believed the sun went around the earth.  If this
caution is a reaction to being burned by false assumptions, I can't fault
it.
<p>
What clues do we have for finding black holes?
<h1>The Case of the X-ray Lighthouse</h1>
As I explained in the <a href="outside.html">Outside 'em</a> section,
material mucking about around the black hole forms a disk-like structure
called an accretion disk.  This disk also has twin jets of streaming
high-powered particles that are perpendicular to this disk.  Those jets
make black holes powerful x-ray emitters.  As it happens, there are these
astronomers that scan the skies with x-ray telescopes.  When such x-ray
astronomers find a strong source of x-rays and trace it back, they
sometimes find a very tiny source.  Ah, could this be a black hole?  Heh
heh.
<h1>The Case of the Redshifted Object</h1>
Astronomers can locate black holes using their accretion disk in another
fashion: redshifting.  What's that?  Well, it's similar to the Doppler
effect.  You know, when you're watching a car on the street come towards
you and it's honking its horn, the horn seems to be higher-pitched than
normal.  When the car passes in front of you, the pitch seems okay.  When
the car moves away from you, the horn seems lower-pitched than normal.
That's the Doppler effect.
<p>
Redshifting is very similar to that, except it deals with light.  The
light from an object that is moving away from you seems to have a lower
frequency.  What?  A yellowish star that is moving away from you seems to
be reddish.  An x-ray source that is moving away from you very quickly
could get redshifted enough to seem like a visible light source!  The
opposite of redshifting is blueshifting, which happens when an object is
moving towards you.  It's kinda like redshifting in reverse: objects that
are reddish appear yellowish, and infrared objects could get blueshifted
until they appear to put out visible light.
<p>
Astronomers can measure the redshift of an object and then calculate how
fast it must be moving.  By measuring the redshift of one side of a disk
and the blueshift of the other side, they can get an idea of how fast the
disk is rotating.  If they know how fast the disk is rotating, and they
can kinda estimate how large the disk is (which in itself is quite a
tricky and complicated task), they can kinda guess the mass of the thing
about which the disk rotates.  If perchance some accretion disk should be
going very fast around something that has at least 3 solar masses, ohmy,
could that be a black hole?  Heh heh.
<p>

The image to the right shows the rotational speed of some dust in the
center of the galaxy M84.  According to a <a
href="http://www.stsci.edu/EPA/PR.html">Hubble Space Telescope's Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)</a> press release, "...the change in
wavelength records whether an object is moving toward or away from the
observer. The larger the excursion from the centerline -- as seen as a
green and yellow picture element (pixels) along the center strip, the
greater the rotational velocity. This motion allowed astronomers to
calculate that the black hole contains at least 300 million solar
masses."<a href="breferences.html#signature"><sup>1</sup></a>
<br clear="right">
<h1>The Case of the Quaking Quasars!</h1>
Astronomers also use this technique to learn more about a curious class of
objects called quasars.  The term stands for quasi-stellar object.  See,
far away in the oldest parts of the universe are these extremely bright
objects that look just like stars.  They would have to be mind-bogglingly
bright to be that visible at such large distances---they would have to be
about 10 million solar masses.  That's nice, but what does it have
to do with black holes?  These quasars have another peculiar quality: they
fluctuate irregularly.  The diameter of the quasar changes very quickly.
Is this important?  Yes; according to astronomers, for a quasar to be that
bright, it would also have to be huge.  We're talking
mega-super-duper-massive stars.  The only catch is that quasars fluctuate
so quickly that, if it were a big ol' star, the matter would have to go
faster than the speed of light, which matter can't do.
<p>
Deduction?  Quasars must be small.  They can't be stars.  Oh dear, what
could they be?  Hmm, black holes with accretion disks were calculated to
put out tremendous amounts of energy.  Could quasars be black holes?  Heh
heh.<br>
<img src="../media/quasar3.jpg"
align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="134" height="134">
Here's your run-of-the-mill quasar picture<a
href="breferences.html#quasar"><sup>2</sup></a>. It doesn't look like
much, does it?  Just some yellowy blob of a picture. That yellowy blob is
1.5 billion light years from earth, and it's designation is PHL 909.
Actually, the blob is an elliptical galaxy (a very old, round galaxy)
that's host to the quasar.
<h1>The Case of the Wobbling Star</h1>
A common term in astronomy is a binary system, a pair of
stars that move around one another in a complicated orbit.  Sometimes,
astronomers find a star that behaves like it is part of a binary system,
but they can't seem to find its partner.  How do they find only one
partner of a binary system?  The visible binary member would appear to
wobble. Astronomers are interested in stars that move for their own
reasons, so they would track this wobble.  It would be noticed that the
star is following an orbit around another star, just like a binary system.
The only problem is that there is no visible partner.
<p>
That in itself is not enough to say that the partner is a black hole.
Many binary systems involve neutron stars.  How?  Well, there are three
scenarios.  When binary stars orbit one another, sometimes they get close
enough that they steal each other's atmosphere.  It happens readily
enough.  Eventually, one of the stars supernovas, leaving a white dwarf, a
neutron star, or a black hole.  That's the first scenario.  What can also
happen is that one of the stars reaches the end of its lifetime, and it
supernovas. <img
src="../media/thief.jpg"
align="right" hspace="10" vpsace="10" width="400" height="200">
 The remnant of that explosion could become a black hole, if
it has sufficient mass. Situation three is a combination of the two other
scenarios. A star in a binary system could steal atmosphere from its
partner and supernova, not forming a black hole.  The force of its
explosion could make its partner supernova, as well, and it <i>does</i>
form a black hole.  Whew!
<p>
So, how do scientists tell whether the invisible partner is a white dwarf,
a neutron star, or a black hole?  They calculate its mass by watching the
movements of the partner.  If the visible star holds a loose orbit,
perhaps the partner is only a white dwarf.  However, if the partner orbits
tightly, it could be moving around a black hole.  Say the mass is measured
at greater than 3 solar masses.  Could this be a binary system with a
black hole?  Heh heh.
<h1>The Case of the Galactic Turning-Point</h1>
So far all I've mentioned are the tiny black holes and not a peep did I
give about the more easily found super-massive black holes.  How forgetful
of me! I hope you're familar with the structure of a galaxy: the core and
some stuff surrounding it.  That stuff could be spread out in a spiral
shape or close to the core in a spherical shape, among other things.  It's
the core that's interesting.  Y'see, the cores of some galaxies are quite
<img src="../media/galaxy.jpg"
align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="141" height="320"> actively
shooting out particles at high speeds in these jets that look
suspiciously familiar to the jets on an accretion disk. Look at the
picture on the left<h5><a href="breferences.html#galaxy">1</a></h5>...
Normal galaxy, powerful jets. Astronomers, curious as they were, peeked at
the cores of these galaxies.  They found the stars near the core were
revolving about something rather quickly. Judging from their speeds, that
something was about as massive as a couple million suns---and yet, where
was it?
<p>
Even more curious, astronomers peeked at the cores of galaxies that
weren't streaming energy, and found pretty much the same thing!  It looked
like most galaxies had these very small <i>extremely</i> massive things at
their very cores.  They collected some data, developed some theories, and
found that the mass of the invisible thing in the center was usually
directly proportional to the galaxy.  A large galaxy would have a large
center turning-point mass, and a small galaxy a small turning-point mass.
This also links in with the quasars, for the mass at the center of the
galaxies was capable of supplying the energy required to fuel a
quasar---and in some cases it was a quasar!  Something that large and that
small at the center of a galaxy could only be a super-massive black hole,
right?  Heh heh.
<h1>The Case of the Gravitational Wave</h1>
Gravitational waves are tricky because I only recently learned what they
are. What are they? In short and horribly simplified large accelerating
bodies like binary star systems radiate energy in the form of
gravitational waves as the binary members lose gravitational potential
energy. Translation: as the stars in a binary get closer to one another,
they give off gravitational waves. These waves are ripples of spacetime
itself (unlike light rays, which travel through spacetime). They propagate
at the speed of light and are not altered by the matter through which they
pass. They affect the stuff they pass through by alternately compressing
and rarifying things. Yeech, that didn't make much sense. Go to <a
href="http://www.dragonweave.com/gothos/html/gravitational_waves.html">the Guide to Gravitational Waves</a>
for a much better description, okay?
<p>
Anyway, if detected, these waves could pinpoint binary pairs of black
holes and possibly even singular black holes (that's almost a pun --- get
it? singular? singularity? ... laugh, dammit!). These guys would be unique
and identifiable by their signatures and would give a wealth of
information about their current status. Binaries are more fun because
they're slighty easier for the earth-based detectors to find and because
they're not just sitting still like lumps.  Binaries do fun stuff like
rotate and inspiral. The detection of a gravitational wave would verify
<i>once 'n' for all and without a doubt</i> the existence of black holes,
and there are no few people currently developing detectors of all sorts.
<p>
I should explain the table a bit. In the Galaxy column you'll find the
name of the host galaxy, the place where the black hole is. The NGC/M
disgnations are tricky because there are two different classfication
systems for things that are not stars.  The 'M-number' designation
is the object's Messier number, and the 'NGC-number' designation is the
object's New General Catalog number.  Some objects belong to both
systems. The Comment column gives anything of note of that particular
object, such as a common name or the location. The Constellation column
shows in which general direction the object is---and constellations are
handy direction names. The Type column tells you what kind of galaxy the
object is, from Spiral to Elliptical to Irregular. As I recall from
astronomy class, the classification of galaxies is a little less than an
exact science and more a mix-n-match guessing game. It helps ever so much
that we only get one perspective of each galaxy. Distance column gives the
distance in light years to the object. Luminosity is another tricky thing;
consider it a measure of how bright the object is. Mass refers to the mass
of the black hole, not the host galaxy and is given in the units of solar 
masses. This table is far from up to date, but it's fairly recent...like
within a year.
