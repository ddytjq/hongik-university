              <!-- begin Article Text --><font size="-1"><i>On August 5, 2000, 
              two weeks after finishing third at the Olympic Trials, Nick Rogers 
              ran 13:18.5 for 5000 meters. The mark shattered his personal best 
              by 11 seconds and gave him the "A" qualifier for the Sydney Olympics, 
              where he finished 12th in his opening heat. Still a relative newcomer 
              to the national scene, Rogers burst into prominence in 1999 when 
              he placed 7th in the 5,000m at the U.S. Championships. In 2000, 
              he finished 76th at the World Cross Country Championships, and set 
              personal bests of 13:18.5 and 27:55.17 on the track. Rogers lives 
              and trains in Eugene, Oregon. (01-16-01)</i> </font></font>

              long season, and by the time of the Olympics I had been training 

              for well over a year. The length of the season kind of got to me.

              a top 20 at World Cross [would be great], something like that. Outdoor 

              track, make the world team for Edmonton (the World Championships)

              Looking back at this past year, you started running well in the 
              winter when you won the U.S. 10k Road Championships, then you placed 
              very high at the U.S. Cross-Country Championships (3rd place) and 
              then you had the breakthrough race where you ran 27:55 for 10k and 
              got the Olympic qualifying time. (Editor's Note: Runners must not 
              only finish in the top 3 to make the Olympics in the United States, 
              they must also have run under the Olympic qualifying time.) Was 
              your plan heading into the year to run the 10k at the Olympic Trials?</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b><font color="#003366">NR:</font></b> 
              Actually, I was planning on running the 5k. I had never run a good 
              track 10k before. I knew I could, but obviously not having done 
              it is a different story. I had run the 5k all the year before, so 
              I figured I wanted to focus on the 5, but when I ran that 10k (the 
              27:55), my coach Bill [Dellinger- the legendary coach at Oregon 
              for many years] and I changed our focus to the 10,000m. And then 
              weird enough, at the Olympic Trials, the 10 didn't work out and 
              I came back to make it in the 5.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="333333"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>WJ:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">

              What do you think happened in the 10k (where Nick fell off the pace 

              and eventually dropped out, just two days before he began the qualifying 

              rounds in the 5k)?</font></p>

              I think a lot of it was nerves. Going into it, in my mind, I was 
              one of the favorites for one of the (Olympic) spots and that killed 
              me a bit. But when it came to 5, in terms of PRs I was near the 
              back of the pack, so I was thinking, &quot;Just make the final.&quot; 
              And once I made the final, I thought &quot;Hey just run as hard 
              as I can and try and make the team.&quot; It was just a real low 
              pressure situation.</font></p>

              In the final you ran a gutsy race when, with 1,200 meters to go, 
              you surprised everyone by making a move and opening up a lead over 
              the rest of the field. What were you thinking?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font color="#003366">NR:</font></b> 
              I knew that's what I had to do if I wanted to make a run for it 
              (the Olympics). At the time, I hadn't done any fast speed workouts 
              and I'm not known for my blazing speed to begin with. If I was going 
              to make the team, I'd have to go from 1,200 out. And that's how 
              I had been training all year, to make it a tough race, not let it 
              come down to a last lap kick.</font></p>

              It was pretty bittersweet for me. I had the spot, but not the time, 

              and all the guys around me were celebrating like crazy because they 

              had the time. For me, it was time to refocus. I went back to Eugene 

              for a few days, did some workouts, then went over to Europe and 

              ran well (Nick Ran 13:18 for 5k, well under the Olympic qualifying 

              time of 13:29 in his one race in Europe).<br>

              Yes it was the first time. I can't wait for this season [so I can] 
              get over there and get in a series of races. This last year, I found 
              out the night before my 5k (in Europe) that my coach had had a stroke, 
              so I flew back immediately afterwards to be with him.</font></p>

              Yes, it was a bit difficult, but the good thing was that Meb Keflezighi 
              (a U.S. Olympian in the 10k) was over there with me. We're pretty 
              good friends and he helped me through it pretty well. It was a really 
              difficult situation, but I knew what Bill would want me to do. So

              It's kind of cool for Bill to have all these guys to coach. We'll

              bring the motivation to the table. It's motivating to have a coach 
              who has been there and done that [with so many great athletes]. 
              But in terms of the personal motivation, guys who are looking for 
              their coach to tell them, you can do this, you can do that, are 
              not going to get that from Bill. If you run a spectactular work 
              out. He'll say, &quot;You ran pretty well today.&quot; If you run 
              bad, &quot;You can do better.&quot; That's as much of a pep talk 
              as you're going to get.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Running is 
              very easy when you break it down. There is nothing difficult in 
              the sense of thinking about it, worrying about it. Just go out and 
              run hard.</font></p>

              Sounds pretty simple. But I couldn't agree more. Thanks for doing 

              this interview, Nick. Good luck, this year. See you at the Nationals.</font></p>
