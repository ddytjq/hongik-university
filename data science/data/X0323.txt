<h1>ARTICLE V - DISCATHON</h1>

<p><u>Comment</u>: Discathon is a race in which players throw
their discs, one at at time, through a circuitous 1 km course
defined by a series of &quot;tests&quot; and
&quot;mandatories,&quot; which are typically tall trees and
poles. Each mandatory describes a required flight path. The discs
thrown by the players shall traverse the entire course, although
the players themselves need not follow any specific path. The
object is to complete the course in the shortest time possible.</p>

    <li><a name="501"></a><b>501 Course</b> <ul>
            <li><a name="501.01"></a>501.01 <u>Description</u>:
                The course is approximately 1 km in length,
                typically laid out within a grassland or wooded
                area, with marked start and finish lines. There
                shall be numerous stationary objects such as tall
                trees and poles interspersed throughout the
                course, of which approximately 20 to 30 will be
                designated as mandatories or tests. An even mix
                of challenging flight paths and trajectories is
                desirable without a left or right curve
                advantage. The ideal course offers the player
                several tests (usually 3 or 4) and many
                opportunities to save time which, if attempted
                unsuccessfully, cost additional time. A grassy,
                smooth running surface is preferred with
                topographical change providing additional
                challenge and interest. See Figure 5.1. <img

            <li><a name="501.02"></a>501.02 <u>Lines</u>: Lines
                indicating the start, finish, tests, and when
                necessary, the plane of a double mandatory, shall
                be between 5 cm and 10 cm wide, marked with a
                non-caustic material. <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Starting Line</i>: There shall be
                        four starting lanes, each lane being 2 m
                        wide, with at least 1 m between each
                        lane. See Figure 5.2. <img

                        5.2 </li>
                    <li>B.<i> Finish Line</i>: The finish line
                        should be a double mandatory, advisedly 3
                        m to 5 m wide and height-restricted. The
                        entire disc must pass through the plane
                        established by this line in the correct
                        direction for the course to be completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>C.<i> Test Line</i>: A line, behind which
                        a player must throw in order to complete
                        a test. If not a mandatory itself, the
                        test line shall be marked by cones and
                        have sidelines which extend backward from
                        the ends of the lines at a 120 degree
                        angle to the line. Both the foot
                        placement and the lie disc must be behind
                        the test line and within the sidelines
                        extended to attempt a test throw. See

                    <li>A. Each player, at his or her discretion,
                        shall begin the race with two or three
                        discs, employing exactly two at any given
                        time. Any type of flying disc may be used
                        so long as it meets the minimum

                        be distinctly marked on the upper and
                        lower surfaces. </li>
                    <li>B. Special Restrictions: For game design
                        and safety considerations, discs in play
                        must meet both the W.F.D.F. general disc

                <ul>
                    <li>A. The WFDF rules of play shall cover
                        play for discathon, except as set forth
                        in <a href="#503.01">paragraph 503.01(B)</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Variations</i>: Discathon may be
                        played with slight variation of the rules
                        regarding course length, unplayable lies,
                        interference, penalties, race procedures
                        and/or officiating, depending upon the
                        circumstances in effect at the time. The
                        variations shall be at the discretion of
                        the tournament director, subject to the
                        provisions of Article I of the WFDF
                        rules. All players shall be notified of
                        any variation of the rules prior to the
                        commencement of play. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a name="503.02&lt;u&gt;"></a>503.02<u> Start of
                Play</u>: Players shall be assigned a starting
                order (not to be confused with a specific
                starting group), and started at 4-minute
                intervals in groups of four players. The starter
                shall have players select lanes in inverse order
                of the starting list, and shall begin the race
                with a call of, &quot;Ready...set...throw.&quot;
                The cadence of the call shall be such that it is
                unpredictable. A player releasing his or her
                starting throw prior to the call of
                &quot;Throw,&quot; shall be penalized 10 seconds,
                or may be disqualified if throwing more than 3
                seconds too early. </li>
            <li><a name="503.03"></a>503.03 <u>Play</u>: Each
                player will be timed while attempting to
                correctly negotiate the course as quickly as
                possible. The player begins by throwing a disc
                from behind the starting line, then continues
                throughout the course, making each subsequent
                throw from the lie obtained from the previous
                throw until his or her disc completely crosses
                the finish line. The player whose throws travel
                the course in the shortest amount of time,
                including time adjustments and penalties, shall
                be declared the winner. The responsibility for
                correct completion of the course, including
                knowledge of the designated route and all
                procedures of play, rests entirely with the
                competing player. A player not completing the
                course route correctly is to be given a penalty
                of twice the estimated time saved or 10 seconds,
                whichever is greater, for each such infraction. A
                player may be disqualified if it is determined by
                the head judge that the player's failure to
                complete the course route correctly was
                intentional. </li>
            <li><a name="503.04"></a>503.04 <u>Throws</u>: <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Initial Throw</i>: The initial
                        throw shall be made from behind the
                        starting line after the signal is given
                        by the starter. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Subsequent Throws</i>: All
                        subsequent throws shall be made from the
                        lie area established by the previous
                        throw with the exception of the
                        establishment of an unplayable lie, which
                        is governed by <a href="#503.05">Section
                        503.05(D)</a> or a self-caught flight.
                        The throw shall be released with one of
                        the player's supporting points at least
                        partially within the lie area. The disc
                        determining the lie shall remain in place
                        while the throw is being made and shall
                        be picked up only after the throw is
                        released. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Technique</i>: Throws may be made
                        in any direction, subject to <a

            <li><a name="503.05"></a>503.05 <u>Lie</u>: The lie
                must be established by a disc at rest, either
                coming to rest naturally or by the player
                stopping the disc's movement once it is on the
                ground. A player must make a ground contact
                within 1.5 m of the center of the disc at rest
                during the release of his or her throw. A player
                using any incorrect placement and or throwing
                procedure is to be given a penalty of twice the
                estimated time saved or 10 seconds, whichever is
                greater, for each such infraction. See Figure

                    <li>A. <i>Airborne Discs</i>: A player may
                        not touch or catch his or her thrown disc
                        or otherwise attempt to establish a lie
                        while that disc is in the air, unless he
                        or she is attempting to execute a
                        self-caught flight around a mandatory. If
                        he or she catches a disc which has
                        correctly passed through the both planes
                        of a single mandatory or the one plane of
                        a double mandatory in one flight while
                        not having broken any of the planes with
                        his or her body, the player need not
                        establish a lie, but may carry the disc
                        while making up to three ground contacts
                        before releasing his or her next throw. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Out-of-Bounds</i>: In the event
                        that the disc comes to rest in an area
                        declared out-of-bounds, it may not be
                        retrieved. If the player possesses two
                        remaining discs, he or she may establish
                        a new lie at the point where the disc
                        entered into the out-of-bounds area. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Unplayable Lies</i>: In the event a
                        throw cannot be made from a lie area such
                        as a lie in a body of water or within
                        thick brush, the player shall choose to
                        either retrieve the disc or use one of
                        the two remaining discs he or she is
                        carrying to establish a new lie in the
                        following manner: <ul>
                            <li>(1) Ground-Level Lies: The new
                                lie shall be located at the
                                estimated point where the disc
                                entered into the unplayable area.

                                beneath the unplayable disc. If
                                the area directly under the disc
                                is also unplayable, then the new

                        player cannot locate one of his or her
                        discs presumed to lie in a playable area,
                        the player may declare a lost disc and
                        establish a new lie with one of his or
                        her two remaining discs at the point he
                        or she estimates would be the lie of the
                        lost disc. After the completion of the
                        course, the player shall report the lost
                        disc to the statistician who shall assess
                        a 10- second penalty. A player may be
                        assessed an additional time penalty or be
                        disqualified if it is determined by the
                        head judge that the lost disc declaration
                        was exploited, intentionally or
                        otherwise, to gain competitive advantage.

                <ul>
                    <li>A. A player shall carry at least two
                        discs which shall be actively in play
                        throughout the traversal of the course.
                        One disc shall establish the lie while
                        the other is being thrown, with the discs
                        being thrown in alternate sequence. </li>
                    <li>B. Third Disc Option: A player may, at
                        his or her discretion, begin the race
                        with three discs as a safeguard against
                        disqualification in the event of one
                        unplayable lie, out-of-bounds, or lost
                        disc. </li>
                    <li>C. Shortage of Discs: If during the
                        traversal of the course a player has only
                        one disc remaining actively in play, that
                        player may not continue and shall be

                <ul>
                    <li>A. A player shall follow the designated
                        flight path, properly negotiating each
                        mandatory along the path by throwing his
                        or her disc around or through the
                        designated area in the correct direction,
                        prior to proceeding toward the finish
                        line. The proper flight path shall be
                        designated by an arrow or other signal. A
                        throw passing the mandatory incorrectly
                        is insufficient and the player shall do
                        whatever is necessary within the rules to
                        successfully negotiate the mandatories
                        prior to proceeding toward the finish
                        line. If return throws are necessary to
                        establish a lie for the correct
                        completion of the mandatory, they may
                        pass through the mandatory in the reverse
                        direction, without a penalty being
                        assessed. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Single Mandatory</i>: If one object
                        is used to indicate a mandatory, the disc
                        shall be thrown through two vertical
                        planes on the indicated side of the
                        mandatory in the correct order and
                        direction to properly complete the
                        mandatory. One plane is perpendicular to
                        a line drawn between the mandatory in
                        question and the previous mandatory, or
                        if there is no previous mandatory, the
                        starting line. The second plane is
                        perpendicular to a line drawn between the
                        mandatory in question and the subsequent
                        mandatory, or if there is no subsequent
                        mandatory, the finish line. See Figure
                        5.4. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Double Mandatory</i>: If the
                        mandatory is defined as the area between
                        two objects in close proximity to each
                        other, the disc shall be required to be
                        thrown completely through the vertical
                        plane connecting the two objects in the
                        direction from the previous mandatory to
                        the subsequent mandatory. See Figure 5.5.

                    <li>(1) Height-Restricted Double Mandatory: A
                        double mandatory may also be
                        height-restricted, establishing an upper
                        or lower limit by stretching
                        high-visibility tape between the two

            <li><a name="503.08"></a>503.08 <u>Test</u>: To pass
                the test, a player must have both his or her lie
                disc and foot placement completely behind the
                test line and complete the next
                &quot;target&quot; double mandatory in a single
                throw. If the player fails the test or chooses
                not to take it, he or she need not pass over the
                test line if it is not a mandatory, but shall be
                required to complete both the double mandatory
                which serves as the test target and an additional
                penalty mandatory immediately after the target.

                Conduct</u>: The following sections are not
                exhaustive. Any situation in which a player may
                gain an unfair advantage by compromising his or
                her responsibilities to another player may result
                in adjustment, penalty and/or disqualification,
                at the head judge's discretion. A penalty of
                twice the estimated time saved shall be assessed
                in situations where no other player is directly
                affected by the violation. A penalty of four
                times the estimated time saved shall be assessed
                in situations where another player is directly
                affected. If no time has been saved, the amount
                of penalty shall be determined by the head judge,
                based upon the severity of the infraction. <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Etiquette:</i> Players shall make
                        every effort to compete without
                        interfering with one another. Players,
                        while throwing, shall exercise caution to
                        avoid striking other players or their
                        discs in flight. Likewise, players shall
                        make every effort to avoid interfering
                        with the throws of another. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Rights of Way</i>: The disc of a

                        has immediate right-of-way over an
                        oncoming runner. Further, whenever two

                        landed so closely together as to cause
                        mutual interference, the player who has
                        established position first has the

                        If a player picks up or throws another
                        player's disc, the player using the wrong
                        disc may be penalized or disqualified
                        unless he or she is able to correct his
                        or her error by returning the disc to its
                        original position without interfering
                        with the progress of the other player.
                        The head judge may consider a time
                        adjustment or a rerun for the player
                        whose disc was misplayed. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Unintentional Interference</i>:
                        Because of the open nature of the course
                        and the presence of other runners,
                        officials and spectators, discathon
                        players are vulnerable to a significant
                        amount of unintentional interference.
                        This includes such random factors as a
                        disc hitting an animal, a course
                        observer, a spectator or another racer.
                        The risk of this kind of interference is
                        part of the course and no adjustments to
                        times shall be made. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Purposive Interference</i>:
                        Purposive interference includes any
                        actions committed by spectators or other
                        runners which are intended to hamper or
                        obstruct a player's disc in flight, his
                        or her throwing or running motions, or
                        his or her positioning for a throw. This
                        type of interference also includes gross
                        violations of running etiquette which
                        hamper or obstruct, regardless of
                        intention, and the carrying away of a
                        disc by an animal. In cases of purposive
                        interference, the head judge may award an
                        estimated time adjustment or a rerun to
                        the affected runner at the judge's
                        discretion. The decision to award a rerun
                        is based on the severity of the
                        interference and the ability of the judge
                        to accurately estimate the time loss. </li>

                Players must be at the event site prepared to
                compete when called. The competitive order of
                these calls is to be posted. In the event of a
                player not responding to the official's call, the
                following procedures come into effect:If a player
                fails to appear for his or her assigned starting
                group when called on deck by the race steward,
                the next player in the starting order shall move
                up and assume the place of the absent player. The
                absent player shall be called again for the next
                starting group. If he or she appears, he or she
                may start but shall be assigned a 15 second
                penalty. If there is no response to the second
                call, the player shall be listed as a scratch
                (SCR). </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="505"></a><b>505 Variation</b> <ul>
            <li><u>Controlled Pace:</u> Controlled pace discathon
                is a variation in which players move around the
                course at a speed that is monitored. It is
                particularly suggested for grand master, senior
                grand master and legend competitions. Each group
                of players is accompanied by an official who
                calls out their throws every thirty seconds. The
                call is, &quot;Throw...one,&quot; (at 30
                seconds);&quot;Throw...two,&quot; (at 60
                seconds), etc. The players are to release their
                throws on the call of the throw number or within
                ten seconds after the call. If they do not throw
                during this 10 second period they must wait until
                the next call to throw. All of the players'
                throws are to be made in this manner with one
                exception. When a player intends to make his or
                her final throw of the course, he or she may
                throw prior to the call for that throw. If the
                early shot fails to complete the course, the
                player may not throw on the next call (the throw
                he or she has already taken) but must wait for
                the subsequent call as each player may only take
                one early throw each round. Except for the
                paced-throwing feature, all the other ground
                rules of discathon apply. The play, of course, is
                quite different, not requiring the players to run
                except possibly for the final, early throw. As
                the players move around the course, the more
                efficient throwers move into the lead. The end of
                the race is also of strategic interest depending
                upon the positioning of the players and their use
                of the early final-throw option. On an informal
                basis players can call out their own throws at
                any pace they wish. </li>

                measured from the center of the player's thrown
                disc at rest. All of the player's throws, other
                than the initial throw, shall be made from within
                this lie area established by the preceding throw.
