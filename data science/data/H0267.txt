<h4> SCOPE </h4>

This release contains 1696 references. 
<p>
The following areas are essentially covered:
<ul>
<li>
     statistical analysis and prediction of functional sites,
<li>
     prediction of protein-coding regions,
<li>
     linguistics of nucleotide sequences.
</ul>

<p>
The following areas are referenced extensively but not exhaustively:
<ul>
<li>
     statistical models of DNA,
<li>
     analysis of codon usage,
<li>
     information theory approach to nucleotide sequences analysis,
<li>
     genetic code.
</ul>

<p>
There are also some references on:
<ul>
<li>
     DNA structure and nucleosome positioning.
</ul>

References are supplied with keywords. The list of keywords currently
consists of 166 entries (see below).

<hr>
<h4> FORMAT </h4>

Each entry can contain the following fields (in an arbitrary order):
<ul>
<li> identifier
<li> authors
<li> title
<li> location
<li> keywords
<li> comment
</ul>
and terminates with the double slash
<dl>
<dd>
     //
</dl>

<p>
The field name starts at position 1.
<p>
The field content is indented to position 4.
<p>
Multiple contents are separated by semicolons.
<p>
Each 'identifier' is unique and consists of 8 characters:
<dl>
<dd>
     NNNIYYSS
</dl>
where:
<dl>
<dt> NNN
<dd> are first 3 letters of the last name of the first author;

<dt> I
<dd> is first letter of the first name of the first author
               (exceptions to this rule can occur);
<dt> YY
<dd> last 2 digits of the publication year;

<dt> SS
<dd> serial number of entries with the same identifier prefixes
               (starting with 01).
</dl>
<p>
A compatibility with the SEQANALREF data bank identifiers (see
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS) was attempted but not always sustained, especially
in relaively late references.

<p>
The 'keywords' field contains keyword(s) describing the content of
the publication. The list of the keywords is given below. Keywords
describe, when appropriate, field, approach, structures, processes,
ferments and sites being analyzed, and organisms involved.

<p>
The 'comment' field contains the information about the language of
the publication (if not English), 'In press' note and maybe other 
short notes.

<p>
Entries are listed in identifier alphanumerical order.
