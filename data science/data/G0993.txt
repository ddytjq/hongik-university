Abstract
<p>
Surface photometry of 17 inclined Sa-Sb galaxies with prominent bulges from 
the ESO-LV Data Base has been analyzed with the aim of detecting the possible 
effects of a hypothetical absorbing layer bisecting the central bulge. Our 
method is based on looking for an asymmetry between the photometric profiles 
of the two semi-minor axes, and is complementary to the surface 
brightness-inclination test which, for early spirals with bright bulges, is 
confused by the very presence of these bulges. None of the galaxies in our 
sample shows evidence of a continuous, near-opaque layer reaching the very 
center. Our conclusions are strengthened by two additional, well-studied 
objects, M 31 and M 104; our results indicate a lower obscuration in the 
central regions of early spirals with strong bulges compared to later types, 
and contribute to discriminate between competing models of light obscuration 
within galactic disks.
