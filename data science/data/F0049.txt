style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">This book is a high-level, 
introductory look at the .NET Framework. By technical book standards, it’s a 
fairly light 201 pages of content. Wide margins and relatively large typeface 
(by say, <SPAN class=SpellE>Wrox</SPAN> standards) make it even lighter. Couple 
these facts with the fact that the book was released in April 2001 (soon after 
the release of Beta 2) and the fact that it’s covering what we all probably know 
by now is a massive framework and you begin to see a picture that is less than 
flattering.</SPAN></FONT></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">With such short space 
available, you would hope the author gets quickly to the point. Unfortunately, 
this author doesn’t. Instead, he feels the need to rehash the golly-gosh 
features of the internet. We learn (again?) that the web started out as merely a 
means of browsing static content, but now he uses the web to watch streaming 
video sports highlights, downloading songs and set up a video camera link to his 
mother. Surely his, at least somewhat, technical audience doesn’t need this 
speech again; especially with 200 pages to cover “The 
Framework”.</SPAN></FONT></P>

the structure of the book. It’s framed in a problem-solution format that could 
work well. However, I found the problem was so obviously set up to be knocked 
down by the solution that the exercise became annoying. It would have been more 
straightforward (honest?) to simply state what .NET does and what problems it 
solves instead of posing it as the answer to all our prayers.</SPAN></FONT></P>

clearly written and a decent read. And, as the book moves on, it does reveal 
some interesting information about the .NET Framework. The review of ASP.NET, 
for example, is a decently detailed chapter of some of the changes to 
ASP.&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></P>

Platt continues with his new style of writing 
IT books that he started with a book that I had chance to read called 
"Understanding COM+". Author that previously wrote very low-level oriented C++ 
books, this time writes for managers, high-level architects and very little for 
developers. I found myself looking for more code, but I think I couldn't consume 
more than the author provided because the topic was to broad and I needed just 
that: A bird's eye view of .Net architecture. I was able to grasp the high level 
architecture of .Net reasonable well, but somehow felt I had missed more 
explanations.</P>
<P>The examples of type "Hello world" for different functionality of .Net 
framework were easy to follow even without knowing the exact syntax of VB.Net 
language (used to explain the main points).As a coder I skimmed quickly over 
"Problem background" topics and delved deeper into "Solution architecture". The 
former topics were obviously intended for managers.Imagine being in a mind of a 
manager dealing with ActiveX, COM/COM+ projects,wanting to figure out why .Net 
was introduced, you will then realize that some analogy between COM based and 
.Net technology was necessary.</P>
<P>What I noticed when I read through the material was that I didn't pick up all 
points in the first pass. It was rewarding to go again and scan a topic of 
interest this time with much sharper eye. This book has everything for anybody. 
The author certainly new he would be hated by developers if he hadn't provided 
solid examples. These were simple but informative enough and gave you enough to 
start digging into a reach set of functionality that .Net provides.</P>
<P>For the size of the book and intended audience this book achieved its goal of 
providing an introduction to .Net and I was suppressed how much information 
could fit into 200 pages. I am looking forward to reading an introduction to the 
next new technology by the same author in a few years. In the meantime Microsoft 
please, give us a chance to consume this big beast called 
.Net.</P></TD></TR></Table><Table width='100%' border=1 cellpadding=5><TR><TD  id=RevTitle><FONT color=navy size=6>Introducing Microsoft .NET might be just what you need.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD id=RevAuthor >Reviewed By:  <a name=AynShipley><A href='Reviewer.asp?Rid=8&ISBN=073561377X' >Ayn Shipley</a></TD></TR><TR><TD id=Review><P class=MsoNormal><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">This book does exactly what it says it will – it introduces

VisualStudio.Net. Therefore, I will try to write about my impression and what I 
was able to gain after I finished reading the book. The main reason I decided to 
read Introducing Microsoft .NET by David S. Platt was to widen my knowledge in 
this matter. As the title suggests, this book is not a step-by-step tutorial or 
some kind of reference material which one could use in every day programming but 
it is a great presentation of what .NET is going to 'look like' when it is 
released to the full production.</P>
<P>This book is perfect for Visual Basic (VB) developers since most of code 
samples are from VB.NET and one can easily follow/understand the presented 
concept without any need to try it on the computer. In my opinion, this is the 
biggest plus of this book, one can just lie down on a sofa, relax, and read it. 
Another great feature of this book is explanation by David S. Platt of how to 
migrate to .NET or how .NET is utilizing the existing technology. </P>
<P>In this book author tries to point out which features are likely to change in 
the future releases of .NET, why Microsoft implementation went the way it did, 
why Microsoft changed some implementations between beta releases, which tools 
included in the Microsoft .NET SDK and VS.NET were bad and what kind of problems 
he experienced using them. This type of honesty is unusual in the computer book 
publishing business, specially when publisher is Microsoft Press. </P>
<P>This book is very well written and shows that the author has a good sense of 
humour. Each chapter covers one subject, and is illustrated with diagrams, code 
samples (provided on the Web site) and excellent explanations. I wouldn 't call 
this a real book review because I've never written one before but it still 
provides some idea what this interesting book is all about. </P></TD></TR></Table>
