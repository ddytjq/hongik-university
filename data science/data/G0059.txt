    becomes visible. The corona is faint compared to the Sun, so
    it can only be seen when the Sun is blocked from view. Jean Bernard
    Leon Foucault, with the physicist Armand Fizeau, took the first
    clear photograph of the Sun in 1845.</FONT></P>

    <P>The mystery lies in the question: Does a solar eclipse somehow
    affect a Foucault pendulum? In 1954, Maurice Allais reported
    that a Foucault pendulum exhibited peculiar movements at the
    time of a solar eclipse. If true, his finding raises new questions
    about the nature of such phenomena.</P>

    <P>For the upcoming eclipse, the NASA/Marshall Space Sciences
    Lab is coordinating an internet and video collaboration between
    observatories and universities to test the Allais effect. Participants
    on 4 continents (Central Europe, North America, Middle Asia,
    and Australasia), are from at least 7 countries (US, Austria,
    Germany, Italy, Australia, 4 sites in the United Arab Emirates,

    </TABLE>The inventor of the gyroscope, Jean Bernard Leon Foucault,
    demonstrated during the 1851 World's Fair that a pendulum could

    force, Foucault's demonstration forever attached his name both
    to the effect itself (the Foucault effect) and to the universal
    joint pendulum that freely swings and rotates at the same time
    (the Foucault pendulum).<BR>

    <P>A basic Foucault pendulum is simply a weight on a wire. Practically
    any pocket watch has the potential to act as a pendulum, exhibiting
    up to a 10 to 15 degree rotation per hour around its hinge point.
    To an observer in a windowless room, the rotation that accompanies
    the swing is a kind of optical illusion: the pendulum is not
    turning, instead the Earth is actually rotating under the pendulum.
    Foucault's dramatic proof at the World's Fair is considered to
    be the first non-astronomical proof of the Earth's rotation.</P>

    <P>With rotating hinges raised to heights in excess of 90 feet,
    Foucault pendulums are now massive display pieces in the lobbies
    of more than 60 museums and entrance halls around the wo<IMG

    including the United Nations Building in New York and at the
    Smithsonian Museum in Washington.</P>

    <P>Remarkably, little more than two long-term scientific records
    for Foucault pendulums have been published. Both experiments
    were conducted by eventual Nobel Prize winners: Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes,
    who won the 1913 Nobel prize in Physics for his investigations
    on the properties of matter at low temperatures (which led to
    the production of liquid helium), and Maurice Allais, who won
    the 1988 Nobel prize in Economics for his contributions to the
    theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources.</P>

    <P><B>An Abrupt Excursion in the Plane: What Allais Published</B></P>

    <P>In a marathon experiment, Maurice Allais released a Foucault
    pendulum every 14 minutes - for 30 days an<IMG SRC="images/NoeverEclipse/allaisNobel.gif"

    vspace="5" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">d nights -without missing a data
    point. He recorded the direction of rotation (in degrees) at
    his Paris laboratory. This energetic show of human endurance
    happened to overlap with the 1954 solar eclipse. During the eclipse,
    the pendulum took an unexpected turn, changing its angle of rotation
    by 13.5 degrees.<BR>
<BR>
    <B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Left</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">: Maurice Allais (1911 - ) won the Nobel Prize
    in Economics in 1988. He stated, &quot;All my researches in theoretical
    and applied physics which, at first sight, appear to be remote
    from my main activity as an economist, have, in reality, enriched
    me with valuable experience.&quot;</FONT></P>

    <P>Both before and after the eclipse, the pendulum experienced
    normal rotation (Foucault effect of 0.19 degrees/minute). This
    13.5-degree excursion in the angular plane persisted throughout
    the length of the eclipse, a total of 2.5 hours of observations.
    Allais got similar results when he later repeated the experiment
    during a solar eclipse in 1959.<BR>

    24 hours at the poles; clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere;
    counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The Allais effect
    observed over 2 and an half hours during the shadow of an extended
    solar eclipse's onset and departure equals nearly the magnitude
    of the Foucault effect itself (or about one tick shown).</FONT></P>

    just after the eclipse maximum (29.581 second max.) and then

    <P>&quot;The initial interpretation of the record points to three
    possibilities,&quot; says Dr. David Noever of NASA/Marshall,
    &quot;A systematic error, a local effect, or the unexplored.
    To eliminate the first two possibilities, we and several other
    observers will use different kinds of measuring instruments in
    a distributed global network of observing stations.&quot;</P>

    and then verifying the effects of a solar eclipse is a difficult
    enterprise. Because an eclipse has a short duration, it is difficult
    to conduct very many tests. Also, eclipse effects usually get
    attributed to some local effect like seismic or temperature changes
    because the experiments are not conducted in several different
    places at once. Therefore, in order to determine whether or not
    the effects of any single eclipse are one-time, localized events,
    many observing stations are needed to test eclipse peculiarities.<BR>
<BR>
    During the next solar eclipse, Noever's team and volunteer scientists
    at several museums will simultaneously observe Foucault pendulums.
    Noever and other scientists will also use a gravimeter - a super-sensitive
    device that reports very small changes in the gravitational force
    acting on a mechanical spring.<BR>
<BR>
    After the eclipse, Noever's team will compare the results of
    all the tests, including observations from areas in Europe that
    lie in the path of the eclipse.<BR>

    eclipse are 3am-9am in North America, and 9a.m.-3p.m. in Europe
    and Middle Asia. These times can be adjusted for exact locations,
    for instance, in Boulder, CO, a data set for recording would
    be about 2:30a.m., continuing until 8:30a.m. That would cover
    the approach of the shadow, the actual eclipse, and the retreat

    If the scientists do observe the Allais effect, the prevailing
    question will be &quot;Why does it occur?&quot; So far, explanations
    have included the anisotropy of space (the condition of having
    different properties in different directions), gravitational
    waves, and solar radiation. <BR>

    But before the cause of the Allais effect can be determined,
    scientists first need to settle the question about whether a
    pendulum really does act differently during a solar eclipse.
    By having a global network of scientists collaborating on a single
    eclipse, the answer to that question will perhaps finally be
    resolved.</P>

    <P>Results of August 11 eclipse will have to be coordinated with
    lunar opposition (2 weeks later) before a first summary of eclipse
    data will be available. Realistically, scientists think it will
    take at least a decade before all opinions are settled. <BR>
<BR>
    In his Nobel Prize autobiographical speech, Allais stated, &quot;My
    main idea at the start was that a link could be established between
    magnetism and gravitation by observing the movements of a pendulum
    consisting of a glass ball oscillating in a magnetic field. Of
    all the observations made in 1952 and 1953 I was not able to
    draw any definitive conclusion. Through certain experimental
    devices, I obtained positive effects, but with other devices
    I obtained no effect whatsoever....all these phenomena are quite
    inexplicable within the framework of the currently accepted theories.&quot;<BR>

    <P>Upon learning of the upcoming effort to investigate the pendulum-eclipse
    mystery, Allais said he was glad and excited that scientists
    are revisiting his experiments. The German rocket scientist Werner
    von Braun, one of the original rocket team members at NASA's
    Marshall Space Flight Center, had encouraged Allais to translate
    one of his pendulum experiments from French into English. Von
    Braun, it seems, believed the experiment could explain anomalies
    in some space object trajectories. When the pendulums start swinging
    on August 11, the early connection between Allais and NASA/Marshall
    will have come full circle.</TD>

    at dawn in the Northeast corridor, North American sites appear
    in opposition to the ground shadow. But if effects have a gravitational
    origin, previous studies would indicate any detection may depend
    more on instrument resolution. To better than one part in 10
