	<P>The conditions set out below, together with the application form the tariff and any other conditions which may be implied by law, form the agreement between you and us. They tell you how your account works and what your and our obligations are once you open an account with us. <B>When we mention your "account" in these conditions, we mean your Bonus Account held with us. Please ask an adult to explain these conditions to you if you find them difficult to understand</B>.
	<P><B>1.	Opening your account</B>
<BR>1.1	To open an account you must be a UK resident.
<BR>1.2	To be eligible for this account you must be under 18. If you are under 7, a person over 18 must open the account on your behalf.
<BR>1.3	At the age of 7 you can open an account in your own name, or, if the account has already been opened on your behalf it can be transferred into your name.
<BR>1.4	You may only open one account in your own name. A person opening an account on your behalf may open one account for you and up to 9 accounts for other children.
<BR>1.5	Any money you put into your account must be:
<UL><LI>in sterling
	<LI>a recognised UK bank cheque</LI>    </UL>
<BR>1.6	You may close  your account within 14 days of it being opened. If you do so, we will return any amount (including interest) we owe you.
<P><B>2.	How your account works</B>
<BR>2.1	We will send you statements on a quarterly basis (four times a year). You may request additional or copy statements.
<BR>2.2	You can take money out of your account from any of our branches, by standing order, by requesting a cheque, or by cash card (see condition 4). Any standing orders or money transfers must be made to another Bonus Account or Future Fund only. To do so you must:
<UL><LI>have enough available money in your account (this means funds which have been fully cleared)
	<LI>comply with these conditions</LI>   </UL>
<BR>2.3	If you are under 7, then the person who opened the account on your behalf must authorise any branch withdrawals and provide a form of identification (eg. full UK driving licence) when they do so.
<BR>2.4	For a cheque to have cleared on your account and the money to be available, you need to allow at least four full working days for cheques paid in from an English bank and five full working days for cheques paid in from a Scottish bank (full working days do not include Saturdays, Sundays or English bank holidays).
<BR>2.5	You may not overdraw or borrow on your account.
<P><B>3.	Interest</B>
<BR>3.1	We will calculate interest on a daily basis on available money in your account.
<BR>3.2	We will pay interest to your account once a year at the rates we set.
<BR>3.3	Details of the rates of interest we will pay are set out in the tariff which we will send to you and which can also be found at any of our branches.
<BR>3.4	We may change the rates of interest from time to time but we will let you know if we do so (see condition 10).
<P><B>4.	Cash Card and PIN</B>
<BR>4.1	We may issue to you a cash card ("card") on the basis of this agreement.
<BR>4.2	This card is our property and you must return it to us immediately if we ask you to do so and any person acting for us may recover or keep it. You must ensure that the card is cut in half before returning it. 
<BR>4.3	You must keep the card safe at all times and must not let anyone else use it with or without your personal identification number (PIN).
<BR>4.4	We may issue you with a PIN which you can use with the card to take out cash from a cash dispenser. You must keep the PIN secret at all times and not let anyone else know or use it.
<BR>4.5	You agree that money taken out using your card and PIN will be deducted from your account. We are not responsible if your card cannot be used at a cash dispenser at any time.
<BR>4.6	You may use the card:
<UL><LI>only in accordance with this agreement 
	<LI>to use facilities which we may make available to you from time to time which we may also withdraw at anytime without notice
	<LI>for a period of 10 years from the date the card 
        is issued but if we have notified you that the card has been cancelled 
        or withdrawn or that this agreement has been terminated then you must 
        not use the card in any circumstances.</LI>                                           </UL>
<BR>4.7	If the card is lost or stolen or you think that it or the PIN may be misused by someone else then you must immediately contact: <B>The Co-operative Bank p.l.c., P.O. Box 150, Delf House, Skelmersdale, Lancs., WN8 6NY (Tel 0845 600 6000).</B>
<BR>If you telephone us then you must write to us confirming your call within seven days quoting your account number.
<BR>4.8	The maximum you will have to pay us for our losses if the card is used by someone without your permission is &pound;50.
<BR>4.9	If the card is used by someone with your permission or as a result of your negligence you may have to repay us for our losses. 
<BR>4.10	You must give us:
<UL><LI>any information you may have in connection with the loss, theft or misuse of any card or disclosure of the PIN
	<LI> any assistance which we may need to help us 
        recover a missing card.</LI>             </UL>
<BR>4.11	If you or we suspect the loss, theft, misuse or disclosure of any card or PIN then we may give the police any information concerning you or your account which we consider relevant.
<BR>4.12	If the card is found after having been reported lost, stolen or liable to misuse then you must not use it but must destroy the card by cutting it in half and returning it immediately to: The Co-operative Bank p.l.c., P.O. Box 200, Delf House, Skelmersdale, Lancs., WN8 6NY.
<BR>4.13	If you or we end this agreement, you must return to us any issued card you may have. 
<BR>4.14	We may cancel the card on written notice from you accompanied by the return of the card to us.
