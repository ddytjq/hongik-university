Cameo appearances are all that Cole can manage at the moment because of inflammation to his heel.
Cole has a small spur of bone on his ankle which pinches his heel and the teenager said : "If the ankle is no better by the time we play Manchester United on January 1st, I think I'll have to go and see a specialist. I'm still not right."

"I think Joe’s aim has got to be trying to get involved in this game." said Keegan, "I think to be quite honest that’s the best he can hope for on Saturday. If I’m realistic that’s his aim for this week. There are 27 players and they’re all champing at the bit to play and he wants to get into that 22. Then he can start thinking about getting into the 11.<!-- text below generated by server.
