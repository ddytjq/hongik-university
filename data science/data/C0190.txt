              &#147;Although it gives us no pleasure to report a loss, it is important 
              that this is taken in context. We have now strengthened our provisions 
              for underwriting losses from the 1998 and 1999 years to the level 
              of our stop loss cover. Having addressed the issues arising from 
              1998 and 1999 we can now concentrate our resources on the future 
              which we regard with increasing optimism now that we have evidence 
              of a material improvement in the motor market. The Group&#146;s 
              marine and non marine syndicates will perform well against their 
              peer groups in the next two years and we believe that their markets

              <br>
              The year under review has seen difficult underwriting conditions. 
              Our markets have remained extremely competitive, although there 
              is now good evidence of a return towards sensible rating conditions

              We report a loss before tax of &pound;1.1 million for the year ended 
              31 December 1999 compared to a profit before tax of &pound;5.0 million 
              for nine months ended 31 December 1998. Earnings per share showed 
              a loss of 0.7p (31 December 1998 &#150; profit of 6.2p). The undiluted 
              net tangible asset value per share at 31 December 1999 remains almost 
              unchanged at 77.6p (31 December 1998 &#150; 77.8p).</p>
            <p class="font" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left">It has been decided 
              to reduce the final dividend from that paid last year in order to 
              retain resources within the Group. Accordingly, your Directors have 
              declared a final dividend for the year of 1.0p net per share (31 
              December 1998 &#150; 2.0p). The dividend will be paid on 14 July 
              2000 to shareholders on the Company&#146;s register at close of 
              business on 5 June 2000. A scrip alternative will be offered to 
              shareholders and your directors and two largest shareholders have 
              agreed to elect for shares instead of the cash dividend.</p>

              <br>
              On 3 March 2000, we announced that Malcolm Mackenzie, Group Chief 
              Executive, had decided to retire early following his recent ill 
              health. Malcolm has been Chief Executive of the Group since its 
              inception in 1997, following a distinguished career at Lloyd&#146;s. 
              We will miss his leadership and experience and wish him a speedy 
              recovery. We also announced that Ray Brick, underwriter of Syndicate 
              587, who is now aged 58 decided that the time was right to hand-over 
              to his deputy. Ray has had a long and successful career at Lloyd&#146;s 
              and we will benefit through the recovery strategy he has helped 
              to implement at Syndicate 587.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">Consequent 
              upon these two retirements, we have made a number of management

              Limited, where Hugh Hayward becomes Chairman, Bob Stuchbery, Underwriting 
              Director and Ewen Gilmour, Managing Director. In addition, Bruce 
              Bartell becomes Underwriter of Syndicate 1096, Mary Towndrow, Underwriter 
              of Syndicate 587 and Nick Adams, Compliance Officer. Ewen Gilmour

              We remain vigilant in our underwriting philosophy and our management

              Strategy and Position</b><br>
              <br>
              It is now two years since the Group announced proposals to become 
              an Integrated Lloyd&#146;s Vehicle based on the Chaucer managed 
              syndicates. We have made significant progress towards that goal, 
              having sold the balance of the Group&#146;s participations on third 
              party syndicates in 1999 and for the 2000 year all the Group&#146;s 
              underwriting interests are allied to the three Chaucer syndicates. 
              With our associated company, Chaucer Dedicated Limited, we now control 
              &pound;131.5 million of Chaucer syndicate capacity, representing 
              52%. Our own underwriting interest in Chaucer syndicates for the 
              2000 year is &pound;93.3 million.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">Shareholders 
              will realise that with net tangible assets of &pound;34.4 million 
              we have an effective underwriting ratio of 2.7 times and will not 
              wish to extend this further until we can be certain of strong underwriting 
              profits. In the absence of the necessary appetite for equity fund 
              raisings, we are likely to fund the Group&#146;s underwriting capacity 
              needs by way of reinsurance arrangements with insurance companies.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">The 
              results we are now reporting comprise a number of elements and in 
              this transitional phase from &#145;spread&#146; to &#145;integrated&#146; 
              underwriting, shareholders may not find the position as easily understandable 
              as a conventional insurance company. For the year to 31 December 
              1999, we account for calendar year fees, expenses and investment 
              income and gains. However in underwriting terms, we account for 
              the results of the 1997 year of account and make provisions for 
              expected losses in 1998 and 1999. Over 80% underwriting participations 
              for 1997 and 1998 are based on syndicates managed by third parties. 
              The position will become more transparent in subsequent years, particularly 
              with a move to annual accounting.Current <br>

              <b>Underwriting Markets</b><br>
              <br>
              The downturn in the present insurance cycle started in late 1995/early 
              1996, and probably earlier in the motor sector. For Lloyd&#146;s, 
              results were reasonable in 1996 but have moved to a marginal loss 
              in 1997. Losses for 1998 and 1999 will be heavy and although some 
              improvement is hoped for in 2000, most commentators are expecting 
              another loss.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">The 
              motor market has been particularly weak. Margins are tight and, 
              in recent years, motor underwriters generally have charged insufficient 
              premiums to meet the cost of claims and servicing the business. 
              Legislative changes, the impact of the Ogden judgment and an increasingly 
              litigious society have worsened the position. Our motor syndicate 
              (587), whilst steadily increasing premium rates since 1998 and taking 
              advantage of improvements in the fleet market, has not been immune 
              from these problems. Although the syndicate&#146;s results are disappointing, 
              we can draw some comfort from the fact that early figures for the 
              2000 year are considerably improved.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">In 
              the marine, aviation and non-marine markets in which we operate, 
              competition has been strong with premium rates in many classes at 
              unacceptable levels. We continue to be resolute in maintaining our 
              underwriting disciplines and to turn away business where the premium 
              is insufficient or the terms are inadequate. To date, the large 
              claims in 1998 and 1999 have done little to quench the market&#146;s 
              thirst for business in these areas and although we believe that 
              these markets have reached their low point, we remain sanguine about 
              the strength of the upturn until we have the experience of a number 
              of months improvements in premium rates.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font"><b>Group 
              Stop Loss</b><br>
              <br>
              During the latter half of 1999, we negotiated a stop loss policy 
              with a major European reinsurance company to cover potential deterioration 
              on Chaucer Holdings&#146; underwriting participations (both direct 
              and through Chaucer Dedicated) for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 years 
              of account. Broadly, the policy covers total losses in excess of 
              5.75% of capacity up to a level of 10%. The policy will not have 
              any bearing on the 1997 year as losses are well below the threshold 
              but could well be of use for the other two years. We have made provisions 
              for the 1998 and 1999 years up to the level at which the stop loss 
              policy cuts in and therefore in the absence of a very severe deterioration 
              through the 10% threshold, the Group will suffer no further adverse 
              effects from these two years.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font"><b>Results 
              for 1997 and Prior Underwriting Years</b><br>
              <br>
              For the 1997 year, the Group underwrote &pound;53.2 million of capacity 
              on a portfolio of 49 third party managed syndicates. The portfolio 
              showed an underwriting loss of &pound;0.9 million which was matched 
              by a provision set up at the time the accounts to 31 December 1998 
              were prepared and therefore the Group results for the year under 
              review are not affected by these figures. The Group had one participation 
              on a syndicate left open from the 1996 year which showed a deterioration 
              of &pound;0.2 million which is charged to the 31 December 1999 result.<br>
              <br>
              Through its shareholding in Chaucer Dedicated Limited, the Group 
              had a &pound;10.0 million interest in a portfolio of Chaucer managed 
              syndicates in the 1997 year. The Group&#146;s share of the attributable 
              losses was &pound;0.2 million which, after taking account of a small 
              carried forward provision and expenses for the year, led to a charge 
              of &pound;0.3 million.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font"><b>Forecasts 
              for the 1998 and 1999 Underwriting Years</b><br>
              <br>
              We have received forecasts for the 1998 underwriting year prepared 
              for the Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate Quarterly Returns at 31 December 
              1999 and have made estimates for the 1999 underwriting year from 
              our own knowledge of Chaucer managed syndicates and by extrapolation 
              from published comments from third party managed syndicates.For 
              the 1998 year, the Group underwrote &pound;60.0 million of capacity 
              on a portfolio of 47 third party managed syndicates. <br>
              <br>
              The mid-points of the syndicate forecasts show that our stop loss 
              policy could be activated and accordingly we have increased our 
              net provisions to the policy threshold of &pound;3.6 million. This 
              compares with a &pound;1.5 million provision in the accounts to 
              31 December 1998 and therefore an additional &pound;2.1 million 
              has been charged to the profit and loss account for the year ended 
              31 December 1999.<br>
              <br>
              For the 1999 year, the Group underwrote &pound;58.5 million of capacity, 
              of which &pound;42.9 million was allocated to Chaucer managed syndicates 
              and &pound;15.6 million to syndicates managed by other agents. Although 
              the mid-points of the forecasts show an underwriting loss marginally 
              below our stop loss policy threshold we have made provisions to 
              the policy threshold of &pound;3.6 million.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Through its shareholding in Chaucer Dedicated Limited, the Group 
              has a &pound;10.0 million interest in a portfolio of Chaucer managed 
              syndicates for the 1998 year and &pound;16.7 million for the 1999 
              year. The Group has provided for its share of the attributable syndicate 
              mid-point forecast losses of &pound;0.4 million (1998) and &pound;0.7 
              million (1999).<br>

            <p class="font">We are delighted with the results and forecasts for 
              Syndicates 1084 and 1096 which compare most favourably with their 
              market peers. Syndicate 587 has suffered along with the majority 
              of Lloyd&#146;s motor syndicates and will still be loss making in 
              the 1999 year.In addition, Chaucer managed aviation Syndicate 173 
              which underwrote through a consortium arrangement with Amlin Underwriting 
              Limited. The agreement was terminated at the end of 1998 and the 
              syndicate placed in run-off. The result for the 1997 year was a 
              loss of 7.7% and the forecast loss for the 1998 year is 10.0% to 
              15.0%. The 1997 year was closed into Amlin Syndicate 2001 and it 
              is anticipated that the 1998 year will close similarly into that 
              syndicate on equivalent terms to the closure of its aviation component.<br>

              <b>Chaucer Managed Capacity in 2000</b><br>
              <br>
              Managed capacity on our own syndicates for 2000 remains approximately 
              the same as for 1999 although the balance has altered. Motor capacity 
              increased by 5.9% to take advantage of the upturn in rates and non-marine 
              capacity by 21.2% to exploit a number of opportunities. Due to highly 
              competitive conditions in the marine and aviation markets we decided 
              to reduce capacity on Syndicate 1084 by 22.5%.</p>

              <br>
              W</span>e have been active in this year&#146;s Capacity Auctions. 
              We sold the remaining &pound;15.6 ALIT spread portfolio, for &pound;2.4 
              million, giving a profit of &pound;2.2 million. As part of our ILV 
              strategy we acquired &pound;29.8 million of capacity on our own 
              managed syndicates at a cost of &pound;0.9 million, together with 
              &pound;4.0 million at a cost of &pound;0.1 million for Chaucer Dedicated 
              Limited.</p>
            <p class="font"><b>Investments</b><br>
              <br>
              At the commencement of the year under review, the Group held 46.4 
              million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust with a value 
              of &pound;37.9 million. On 19 January 1999, the opportunity was 
              taken to move 40% of the Group&#146;s investments into a fixed interest 
              fund. As a result, the Company sold 18.0 million units in the Aberdeen 
              UK Growth Unit Trust to realise approximately &pound;15.0 million 
              and used the proceeds to purchase 50.0 million units in the Aberdeen 
              Fixed Interest Unit Trust. On 5 May 1999, we sold a further 13.5 
              million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invested 
              in a further 38.2 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit 
              Trust.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="font">The investment portfolio at 31 December 1999 comprised 
              15.1 million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and 88.6 
              million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust. The value 
              of the portfolio at 31 December 1999 was &pound;41.5 million, and 
              has given the Group an investment gain of &pound;3.4 million for 
              the year. The Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust continued to perform 
              well, showing an increase of 19.9%, outperforming the FTSE 100 by 
              2%. The Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust is unlikely to produce 
              the same capital appreciation but carries a yield of 8%.<br>
              <br>
              At the end of February 2000, in order to generate more income and 
              to reduce volatility, we decided to sell the Company&#146;s remaining 
              holding of Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invest the proceeds 
              of &pound;13.3 million in the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust. 
              The Company&#146;s investments now comprise 88.6 million units in 
              the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust and 13.4 million units in 
              the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust.</p>
            <p class="font"><b>Chaucer Europe</b><br>
              <br>
              In line with plans to expand our underwriting business, we have 
              successfully established two new European businesses. In April 1999 
              we announced the establishment of Chaucer GmbH based in Hanover, 
              Germany and, shortly afterwards, the acquisition of the business 
              of the Vesta Fire Insurance Corporation of America based in Copenhagen. 
              These businesses have been acquired in order to establish, at low 
              cost, a presence in Europe from which to develop business. As access 
              to new business increases we expect to see further developments 
              of this kind.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Syndicate 587 Office</b><br>
              <br>
              On 16 September 1999, we signed a contract to purchase 4 acres of 
              freehold land at Whitstable near Canterbury on which a new 35,000 
              square foot office for the motor syndicate (587) will be built. 
              Work is well underway and occupation is scheduled for September 
              2000. The site has planning permission for 60,000 square foot of 
              office space, allowing for future expansion. The total cost including 
              land will be in the region of &pound;5 million and will be financed 
              through a mixture of cash resources, borrowing and the exchange 
              of the Group&#146;s existing freehold building in Canterbury which 
              was purchased earlier in the year for &pound;825,000. The offices 
              will be leased to the syndicate at a commercial rent.</p>
            <p class="font"><b>Turnkey Management of Syndicates<br>
              </b><br>
              In March 2000, we announced our appointment by the Mitsui Marine 
              and Fire Insurance Company Limited of Japan to provide a &#145;turnkey&#146; 
              managing agency service to enable them to set up a new corporate 
              syndicate at Lloyd&#146;s. Mitsui&#146;s establishment of a new, 
              wholly corporate, syndicate at Lloyd&#146;s is indicative of the 
              confidence of the Japanese market in Lloyd&#146;s. We expect that 
              others recognising the value of the Lloyd&#146;s franchise and wishing 
              to set up new syndicates will follow Mitsui&#146;s lead. We are 
              confident that further opportunities will arise for Chaucer and 
              as such should provide a valuable source of additional income for 
              the Group.</p>
            <p class="font"><b>Outlook</b><br>
              <br>
              We expect the motor market to show further improvement over the 
              next year. Substantial rate increases have been applied in a number 
              of areas and figures from the first quarter have improved radically 
              over those recorded a year ago.<br>
              <br>
              The improvements in premium rates and conditions in other markets 
              continue to relate to specific classes and are not yet widespread. 
              We will maintain our strict underwriting philosophy, so that when 
              the upturn comes we will be well placed to capitalise upon it.<br>
