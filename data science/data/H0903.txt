AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by
typical clinical features including reduced myelination of both brain and
peripheral nervous system and defective cholesterol biosynthesis. In patients
this results in very low cholesterol concentrations and accumulation of
cholesterol precursors in plasma, tissues, cultured cells and faeces. We now
show that the cholesterol concentration in CSF of Smith-Lemli-Opitz patients is
markedly decreased and that 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol concentrations are
highly increased in comparison to controls. Moreover, dietary treatment of
patients with cholesterol seems not to affect CSF cholesterol concentration.<p>

AB: To extend the enzyme deficiency in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) to
extrahepatic tissues, 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase activity was
measured in fibroblasts from 10 controls, five SLOS homozygotes, and five
obligate heterozygotes. In cells grown almost to confluence in
cholesterol-containing medium (4 mg/dL), the conversion of
[1,2-3H]7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol (7-dehydrocholesterol-delta
7-reductase activity) was 3.8 times higher in control than in homozygote cells
and 2.2 times higher than in heterozygote cells. After 24 hours' exposure of
the fibroblasts to cholesterol-deficient medium supplemented with lovastatin,
7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase activity increased twofold in controls,
but did not change significantly in either heterozygous or homozygous cells. In
contrast, the activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase and lathosterol 5-dehydrogenase, two key enzymes that precede
7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway,
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated binding were equal in
control, homozygote, and heterozygote fibroblasts. Further, HMG-CoA reductase
activity and LDL receptor-mediated binding increased after exposure of the
cells to cholesterol-deficient medium. Fibroblast cholesterol concentrations
were approximately equal, although homozygote cells contained 30 times more
7-dehydrocholesterol. Thus, markedly reduced 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta
7-reductase activity that cannot be upregulated after exposure of the cells to
cholesterol-deficient medium is diagnostic for the biochemical defect in SLOS.
Significantly reduced enzyme activity between the levels in controls and
homozygotes without accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in fibroblasts
identified heterozygotes.<p>

AB: We report here the prenatal diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome
in the first trimester by direct measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in
a chorionic villus (CV) biopsy. The proband was diagnosed clinically at birth
and the diagnosis was confirmed biochemically by demonstrating elevated 7-DHC
in plasma. The family pursued prenatal diagnosis in their fourth, fifth, and
sixth pregnancies. The fourth pregnancy spontaneously miscarried at 9 weeks'
gestation. Analysis in both direct and cultured curetting tissue (identified as
similar to CV tissue) showed an abnormal tissue neutral sterol pattern with an
elevated 7-DHC concentration. The fifth pregnancy also miscarried spontaneously
at 9 weeks but no tissue of unequivocal fetal origin could be identified to
allow biochemical investigation. In the sixth pregnancy, ultrasound examination
at the time of CV sampling showed a thickened nuchal fold. Direct analysis of
the CV sample revealed elevated levels of 7-DHC consistent with the diagnosis
of SLO. The pregnancy was terminated and both fetal tissue and cultured fetal
cells showed marked increases in 7-DHC, confirming the prenatal diagnosis.<p>

findings were of great help in the final diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome (SLOS) type I. MRI was performed for evaluation of the brain
morphology since the clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive but not
unequivocally indicative of SLOS. MRI findings of frontal lobe hypoplasia,
cortical migration defect, and abnormalities of median line structures prompted
the final diagnosis of SLOS.<p>

AB: A male child with multiple congenital anomalies initially was clinically
diagnosed as having Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). Subsequent cytogenetic
studies revealed an interstitial deletion of 17p11.2, which is associated with
Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS). Biochemical studies were not supportive of a
diagnosis of SLOS, and the child did not display the typical SMS phenotype. The
father's karyotype showed a paracentric inversion of 17p, with breakpoints in
p11.2 and p13.3, and the same inversion was also found in two of the father's
sisters. FISH analyses of the deleted and inverted 17p chromosomes indicated
that the deletion was similar to that typically seen in SMS patients and was
found to bracket the proximal inversion breakpoint. Available family members
were genotyped at 33 polymorphic DNA loci in 17p. These studies determined that
the deletion was of paternal origin and that the inversion was of grandpaternal
origin. Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the 17p11.2 deletion arose
following a recombination event involving the father's normal and inverted
chromosome 17 homologues. A mechanism is proposed to explain the simultaneous
deletion and apparent "reinversion" of the recombinant paternal chromosome.
These findings have implications for prenatal counseling of carriers of
paracentric inversions, who typically are considered to bear minimal
reproductive risk.<p>

AB: The Opitz GBBB syndrome (OS) is characterized in part by widely spaced
inner ocular canthi and hypospadias. Recently, linkage analysis showed that the
gene for the X-linked form to be located in an 18 cM region spanning Xp22. We
have now conducted linkage analysis in a family previously published as having
the BBB syndrome and found tight linkage to DXS7104 (Z = 3.3, theta = 0.0). Our
data narrows the candidate region to 4 cM and should facilitate the
identification and characterization of one of the genes involved in midline
development.<p>

AB: The fact that Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a syndrome comprising
major malformations involving a number of organ systems, results from an
abnormality in cholesterol biosynthesis, was discovered only recently.
Utilizing a drug (BM 15.766) to inhibit the same step in cholesterol
biosynthesis as is abnormal in those affected with SLOS, we have developed a
rat model that presents with abnormalities observed as early as gestational day
12 that appear to be consistent with some of those subsequent malformations
that comprise the human syndrome. Abnormalities of the brain and face include
deficiency in the midline region of the upper face, narrowing of the forebrain
hemispheres and of the cerebral aqueduct, and deficiency in the developing
lower jaw. Associated pathogenesis, as observed on gestational day 11 in
histological sections and with scanning electron microscopy, involves abnormal
cell populations at the rim of the developing forebrain and in the alar plate
of the lower midbrain and hind-brain. The affected cells appear abnormally
rounded up, having apparently lost their normal cell contacts. The potential
basis for the selective vulnerability of this cell population and the impact of
its vulnerability relative to subsequent dysmorphogenesis is discussed.<p>

AB: A limitation to treating Smith-Lemli-Opitz infants by giving dietary
cholesterol is their impaired ability to absorb cholesterol due to a deficiency
of bile acids. Since intravenously administered lipoprotein cholesterol should
not require bile acids for uptake into tissues, we tested the effects of this
form of cholesterol on tissue cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol levels in an
animal model of SLO, created by feeding rats 0.02% AY 9944. Intravenous
administration of 15 mg of bovine cholesterol supertrate twice daily increased
serum cholesterol levels from 11 to over 250 mg/dl. This treatment increased
liver cholesterol levels from 309 to over 900 micrograms/g and lowered hepatic
7-dehydrocholesterol levels from 1546 to 909 micrograms/g. A combination of iv
cholesterol and 2% dietary cholesterol was most effective as it raised hepatic
cholesterol levels to 1950 micrograms/g, which is 50% above normal.
7-Dehydrocholesterol levels were decreased to 760 micrograms/g. Similar
responses were seen for heart, lung, kidney, and testes. Brain sterol levels
were not significantly affected. AY 9944 caused a modest increase in hepatic
HMG-CoA reductase activity. Administration of dietary cholesterol together with
iv cholesterol lowered hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity to barely detectable
levels. The data indicate that the combination of iv and dietary cholesterol
was most effective in raising cholesterol levels, lowering 7-dehydrocholesterol
levels, and inhibiting de novo cholesterol biosynthesis.<p>

AB: Tint et al. [N Engl J Med 1994, 330:107-113], working with blood samples
from the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) patients of Irons and Elias showed
the biochemical basis of this disorder to be a cholesterol biosynthesis defect
[Irons et al., Lancet, 1993, 341:1414]. Based on this finding, clinical
protocols for cholesterol and bile acid replacement therapy were established in
a few centers including the University of Pittsburgh. We report our experience
with bile acid and/or cholesterol replacement therapy in six patients with
SLOS, now aged 3-27 years, with a confirmed biochemical diagnosis. Levels of
plasma cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol were correlated with periodic
clinical evaluations over 8-27 months of therapy. There was a marked
improvement in the growth of all the children. There was also an increase in
the plasma cholesterol level in all the children and an overall increase in
their percent sterol as cholesterol. Subjective improvement was also noted in
their development. Although there was no significant change in the plasma
cholesterol level of the older patients, there was a marked improvement in
their behavior and in their quality of life.<p>

AB: Patients with the RSH or Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome (SLOS) have an inborn
error of cholesterol biosynthesis which results in a deficiency of cholesterol
and an elevation of the cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol. A
treatment protocol consisting of administration of cholesterol +/- bile acids
was initiated in an attempt to correct the biochemical abnormalities seen.
Fourteen patients (8 female, 6 male: ages 2 months to 15 years) have now been
treated for 6-15 months. Three patients received cholesterol alone, while 11
patients received cholesterol and one or more bile acids. Biochemical
improvement in sterol levels and in the ratio of cholesterol to total sterols
was noted in all patients. The most marked improvement was noted in patients
presenting with initial cholesterol levels &lt; 40 mg/dl. No toxicity was
observed. Clinical improvement in growth and neurodevelopmental status was also
observed.<p>

AB: We describe the clinical effects of cholesterol supplementation in 6
children with the RSH-"Smith-Lemli-Opitz" syndrome (SLOS). The children ranged
in age from birth to 11 years at the onset of therapy, with pretreatment
cholesterol levels ranging from 8 to 62 mg/dl. Clinical benefits of therapy
were seen in all patients, irrespective of age at onset of treatment, or
severity of cholesterol defect. Effects of treatment included improved growth,
more rapid developmental progress, and a lessening of problem behaviors.
Pubertal progression in older patients, a better tolerance of infection,
improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, and a diminution in photosensitivity
and skin rashes were also noted. There were no adverse reactions to treatment
with cholesterol. This preliminary study suggests that cholesterol
supplementation may be of benefit to patients with the SLOS.<p>

distinguish between blood of normal infants and that of individuals with
Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome. SLO syndrome results in an abnormally low
concentration of blood cholesterol and an elevated concentration of
7-dehydrocholesterol. Blood was spotted on filter paper and analyzed directly
with no extractions or separations. Results showed that using ratios of
fragment ions for cholesterol/dehydrocholesterol, patients with SLO and normal
individuals could be unambiguously distinguished. Unknown samples from 28
individuals were obtained and identified correctly.<p>

AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a common condition caused by
deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase. The syndrome can usually
be diagnosed by demonstrating markedly increased plasma concentrations of the
cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol. We describe a simple and rapid
method for detection of plasma 7-dehydrocholesterol by use of ultraviolet (UV)
spectrometry. Lipids were extracted from plasma by addition of ethanol and
n-hexane, and the n-hexane phase was directly subjected to spectrometry. The
absorption maxima characteristics of 7-dehydrocholesterol (lambda max 271, 282,
and 294 nm) were observed in patients' plasma but not in controls. For
quantitative measurements, absorbance at 282 nm was used. Since this absorbance
is the sum of the absorbance derived from 7-dehydrocholesterol and background
absorbance, the concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol in various plasma
samples were quantified by subtracting estimated background absorbance at 282
nm from observed absorbance at 282 nm. The results correlated well with total
(free plus esterified) 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations measured by
gas-liquid chromatographic method. The UV spectrometric assay was sensitive
enough to detect increased 7-dehydrocholesterol in cultured skin fibroblasts
from patients grown in delipidated medium. The present method will make it
possible to screen plasma or fibroblasts to detect the syndrome rapidly in
general clinical laboratories.<p>

AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a common birth defect syndrome caused by
a deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase, an essential enzyme in
the biosynthesis of cholesterol. The syndrome can usually be diagnosed easily
from the plasma markers of markedly elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol and reduced
cholesterol concentrations. However, atypical cases with normal plasma levels
of cholesterol with only moderately elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol have been
reported. To establish a sensitive method for the biochemical diagnosis of the
atypical cases of the syndrome, we measured sterol concentrations of cultured
skin fibroblasts. 7-Dehydrocholesterol concentrations in patients' fibroblasts
grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum were significantly higher than
those in controls and parents (P &lt; 0.0005), but they were not elevated
proportionately as much as in plasma. To re-produce the accumulation of
7-dehydrocholesterol, the cells were exposed to delipidated medium to induce
sterol biosynthesis. After 4 weeks, 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations in
patients' fibroblasts increased from 2.8 +/- 0.3% to 34 +/- 3% of total sterols
(cholesterol + 7-dehydrocholesterol + 8-dehydrocholesterol). The increase was
also observed in fibroblasts from an atypical patient who has a normal plasma
cholesterol level and a 7-dehydrocholesterol concentration of only 0.15 mg/dl.
In contrast, cells from parents and controls accumulated very little
7-dehydrocholesterol (&lt; 1% of total sterols). These results demonstrate that
cultured fibroblasts exhibit abnormally high accumulation of
7-dehydrocholesterol after cells are exposed to delipidated medium not only in
typical patients, but also in an atypical case. The present method is a
sensitive procedure for the biochemical diagnosis of this syndrome.<p>

AB: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation. SLOS has
an associated defect in cholesterol biosynthesis, but the molecular genetic
basis of this condition has not yet been elucidated. Previously our group
reported a patient with a de novo balanced translocation [t(7;20)(q32.1;q13.2)]
fitting the clinical and biochemical profile of SLOS. Employing fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), a 1.8 Mb chromosome 7-specific yeast artificial
chromosome (YAC) was identified which spanned the translocation breakpoint in
the reported patient. The following is an update of the on-going pursuit to
physically and genetically map the region further, as well as the establishment
of candidate genes in the 7q32.1 breakpoint region.<p>

AB: We reviewed 215 patients (59 new, 156 from the literature) with
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), and found that 95 (44%) had a cardiovascular
malformation (CVM). Classifying CVMs by disordered embryonic mechanisms, there
were 5 (5.3%) class 1 (ectomesenchymal tissue migration abnormalities), 56
(58.9%) class II (abnormal intracardiac blood flow), 25 (26.3%) class IV
(abnormal extracellular matrix), and 5 (5.3%) class V (abnormal targeted
growth). Comparing the frequencies of individual CVMs in this series with a
control group (the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study), there were 6 individual
CVMs which showed a significant difference from expected values. When
frequencies of CVMs in SLOS were analyzed by mechanistic class, classes IV and
V were significantly more frequent, and class I significantly less frequent,
than the control group. Although CVMs in SLOS display mechanistic
heterogeneity, with an overall predominance of class II CVMs, the developmental
error appears to favor alteration of the cardiovascular developmental
mechanisms underlying atrioventricular canal and anomalous pulmonary venous
return. This information should assist the clinical geneticist evaluating a
patient with possible SLOS, and should suggest research direction for the
mechanisms responsible for the SLOS phenotype.<p>

AB: RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz (RSH/SLO) syndrome is an autosomal recessive
malformation syndrome recently shown to be associated with a severe deficiency
of cholesterol biosynthesis and markedly elevated plasma and tissue levels of
7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), the immediate precursor of cholesterol in the
Kandutsch-Russell biosynthetic pathway. Because these biochemical abnormalities
permit a reassessment of RSH/SLO on biochemical criteria rather than less
specific physical criteria, we review here the clinical and biochemical
characteristics of our first 80 patients with abnormally increased levels of
7-DHC. The study population included 68 index patients and 12 additional
relatives identified by quantification of 7-DHC and cholesterol in plasma,
amniotic fluid, or cultured fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, or amniocytes. As
demonstrated in other clinical syndromes when redefined biochemically, we have
found a wider range of clinical expression of RSH/SLO than previously
recognized. These newly recognized atypical RSH/SLO patients included several
with no malformations other than syndactyly of the toes and, at the other
extreme, patients with frank holoprosencephaly or multiple visceral anomalies
who died in utero. Syndactyly of toes 2 and 3 was the most common malformation,
occurring in all but one of 80 patients. The best biochemical predictor of
clinical severity was the plasma cholesterol level, which decreased with
increasing clinical severity. However, at least 10% of patients, including one
newborn infant, had normal cholesterol levels at the time of diagnosis and
would have been missed without specific quantification of 7-DHC. Not
unexpectedly, several patients carrying a clinical diagnosis of RSH/SLO were
found to have normal levels of all plasma sterols and apparently normal
cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured cells. A comparison of the frequency of
anomalies in our biochemically identified patients with similar data from
previously reported clinical series suggests that up to 25% of reports of
RSH/SLO in the literature may describe genetic conditions other than RSH/SLO
with 7-DHC-emia.<p>

AB: We have reassessed patient "S," one of the first 3 individuals recognized
to have Smith-Lemli-Opitz (or RSH) syndrome, at age 34 years, and we describe
his physical, developmental, and behavioral manifestations. This reassessment
provides formal evidence that this individual has the cholesterol biosynthetic
defect which is thought to be the cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. Dietary
manipulation appears to have had a beneficial effect on the patient's behavior
and suggests that even in adults with this condition, dietary cholesterol
supplementation may be indicated.<p>

AB: The Museum Vrolik collection of human anatomy comprises 360 recently
re-described specimens with congenital anomalies. The external findings in one
of these specimens, originally described by Willem Vrolik (1801-1863) 130 years
ago, were suggestive of Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome. Cholesterol synthesis
was analyzed in skin biopsies, obtained from the suspected SLO specimen and a
control specimen. The cholesterol levels in the SLO specimen and in the control
specimen were in the proportion of 1 to 45. This confirms the diagnosis in this
specimen which, to our knowledge, represents the oldest known case of SLO
syndrome.<p>

AB: A new sensitive and specific method for the evaluation of 3
beta-hydroxysteroid delta 7-reductase activity, the defective enzyme in the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome, is described. The assay is based on the use
of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring to measure
the mass of brassicasterol (ergosta-5,22-dien-3 beta-ol) produced by the
incubation of ergosterol (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3 beta-ol) with cultured human
skin fibroblasts. Although the conversion of ergosterol to brassicasterol was
slower than the transformation of [3H]7-dehydrocholesterol to [3H] cholesterol,
cells from control subjects produced brassicasterol efficiently. In contrast,
cells form SLO patients produced very little brassicasterol (P &lt; 0.0001,
patients vs. parents or vs. controls). These results indicate that the
reduction of ergosterol can be used as an assay for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid delta
7-reductase in human skin fibroblasts, which avoids the many problems caused by
the instability and lack of availability of radiolabeled 7-dehydrocholesterol.
The present method made it possible to diagnose the SLO syndrome with high
sensitivity and reliability using a commercially available compound.<p>

AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by accumulation of cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-0l caused by a
deficiency of the enzyme desaturating this sterol to cholesterol. In addition
to other unusual sterols recently found in plasma of patients with SLOS, namely
cholesta-5,8-dien-3 beta-ol and 19-nor-cholesta-5,7,9 (10)-trien-3 beta-ol we
have detected a trienol and we describe here its identification as
cholesta-5,7,9 (11)-trien-3 beta-ol by GC-MS and by comparison with a synthetic
standard. We tested the possibility that the trienol may be formed by radical
oxidation of cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol accumulated in plasma of patients with
SLOS because it is known to be formed by decomposition of
7-hydroperoxy-cholesta-5,8-dien-3 beta-ol, which is a product of
cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol photooxidation. Incubation of cholesta-5,7-dien-3
beta-ol with rat liver microsomes in the presence of ADP/Fe2+ and NADPH gave
rise to a number of oxygenated sterols. Among these, analysis by particle-beam
LC-MS under CI conditions indicated the presence of
7-hydroperoxy-cholesta-5,8-dien-3 beta-ol and of cholesta-5,7,9(11)-trien-3
beta-ol which is known to derive from the oxidation of the 7-hydroperoxide.
From these results we conclude that cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol accumulated in
tissues of patients with SLOS may be oxidized by oxygen radicals giving rise to
oxygenated sterols. Some of these compounds may be toxic and may contribute to
worsen the pathological picture in patients with SLOS.<p>

advent of a biochemical test for SLO has been enormously valuable in
determining which patients are truly affected by the condition, but because of

AB: Our aim is to verify the validity of a rat model proposed for
Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by a
defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7 (7DHC)-reductase and by facial
dysmorphism close to the holoprosencephaly caused by the teratogen AY9944. We
investigated the sterol profile in rats treated with AY9944 blocking
7DHC-reductase. AY9944 was given orally to rats on gestation day 3 (D3). The
sera were sampled for kinetic data on D3, D6, D9, D12, and D21. Cholesterol was
measured in parallel by the routine enzymatic method and by the gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) procedure used in SLO diagnosis. In
addition to sterols, we dosed steroid hormones punctually on D4 and on D10, and
examined D21 fetuses in other animals. The enzymatic method was not specific
for cholesterol, and measured 70% pure 7DHC added to a normal serum. On D21,
77% live fetuses showed pituitary agenesis. Cholesterol was rapidly reduced by
more than 50% on D6 involving an accumulation of 7DHC, 8DHC, and trienols, as
identified in SLO-affected children. The most abundant 7DHC reached a maximum
from D9 to D12, equaling cholesterol on D9 (11 mg/dl). On D10, the magnitudes
of hypocholesterolemic and of 7DHC accumulation were found to be
dose-dependent. Progesterone was reduced as early as 24 hr after treatment and
dropped to 40% of the levels in the controls on D10, correlating to the
decrease in cholesterolemia. This rat model reproduces the same biochemical
perturbations as seen in SLO, strongly suggesting that aberrant sterols (7DHC,
8DHC, or nortrienol) may contribute to the developmental defects.<p>

AB: The RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (RSH/SLOS) is an autosomal recessive
malformation syndrome associated with increased levels of 7-dehydro-cholesterol
(7-DHC) and a defect of cholesterol biosynthesis at the level of 3
beta-hydroxy-steroid-delta7-reductase (7-DHC reductase). Because rats exposed
to inhibitors of 7-DHC reductase during development have a high frequency of
holoprosencephaly (HPE) [Roux et al., 1979], we have undertaken a search for
biochemical evidence of RSH/SLOS and other possible defects of sterol
metabolism among patients with various forms of HPE. We describe 4 patients,
one with semilobar HPE and three others with less complete forms of the HPE
sequence, in whom we have made a biochemical diagnosis of RSH/SLOS. The
clinical and biochemical spectrum of these and other patients with RSH/SLOS
suggests a role of abnormal sterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of their
malformations. The association of HPE and RSH/SLOS is discussed in light of the
recent discoveries that mutations in the embryonic patterning gene, Sonic
Hedgehog (SHH), can cause HPE in humans and that the sonic hedgehog protein
product undergoes autoproteolysis to form a cholesterol-modified active
product. These clinical, biochemical, and molecular studies suggest that HPE
and other malformations in SLOS may be caused by incomplete or abnormal
modification of the sonic hedgehog protein and, possible, other patterning
proteins of the hedgehog class, a hypothesis testable in somatic cell
systems.<p>

AB: Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) was originally described in 1980 in six
sporadic cases of children with structural anomalies including hypothalamic
hamartoma, polydactyly, imperforate anus, and renal and pulmonary anomalies. In
1993, the first familial cases were reported, including affected sibs and
vertical transmission. Three of these families are sufficiently large to allow
initial evaluation by linkage studies to candidate genes or loci. We have
evaluated candidate loci for PHS based on three clinical observations. The
first is a patient with PHS-like malformations, including a hypothalamic
hamartoma, and an unbalanced translocation involving 7q and 3p. The second is a
family with familial PHS where the founder's father had an autosomal dominant
hand malformation previously mapped to 17q. The third is the phenotypic overlap
of PHS and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. In this report, we exclude these loci as
candidates for linkage to the PHS phenotype on the basis of lod scores of less
than-2.0. We conclude that hypothalamic hamartoma is not specific to PHS and
that the dominant hand malformation in one of the families was a coincidence.
To evaluate the relationship of PHS to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, we analysed
levels of cholesterol and intermediate metabolites of the later stages of
cholesterol biosynthesis. There is no evidence of a generalised disorder of
cholesterol biosynthesis in patients with familial PHS. On genetic and
biochemical grounds, we conclude that PHS and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome are
not allelic variants of a single locus.<p>

AB: We measured plasma sterol concentrations in 7 homozygotes with the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, 5 heterozygotes and rats treated with BM 15.766,
the competitive inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase. Low cholesterol
associated with markedly elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations were
detected in the plasma of all homozygotes and inhibitor-treated rats.
Heterozygotes were clinically normal and, like control subjects, showed only
trace amounts of 7-dehydrocholesterol in plasma. We conclude that the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is due to an inherited defect in 7
dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase which causes the accumulation of
7-dehydrocholesterol and a deficiency of cholesterol in the plasma, a
biochemical abnormality that can be reproduced in rats treated with BM
15.766.<p>

AB: We investigated the enzyme defects in two inherited disorders of
cholesterol biosynthesis: sitosterolaemia and the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.
In sitosterolaemic homozygotes, plasma plant sterols (sitosterol and
campesterol) concentrations are elevated because of enhanced intestinal
absorption and diminished removal. Underlying these changes is very low
cholesterol biosynthesis to provide extra sterol for cell growth. Extremely
reduced activities of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme for
cholesterol biosynthesis, caused by deficient HMG-CoA reductase mRNA is
responsible and is the suspected inherited abnormality. The Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome is caused by a block in the last reaction in the cholesterol
biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol,
which is catalysed by 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase. As a result, low
plasma and tissue cholesterol with high 7-dehydrocholesterol levels are found
in homozygotes, who show characteristic phenotypes of mental retardation,
facial dysmorphism, and organ and limb congenital anomalies. Similar
biochemical findings are produced in rats fed BM 15,766, an inhibitor of
7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase. Interestingly, feeding cholesterol can
suppress abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis and improve symptoms in homozygotes

AB: Correct quantitative results for plasma cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol
(7-DHC), and 8-dehydrocholesterol (8-DHC) are invaluable for making the correct
diagnosis in patients with the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO) and for
biochemical monitoring of these patients during therapy. The enzymatic method
for cholesterol measurement based on cholesterol oxidase gives falsely high
values for plasma cholesterol in samples from patients with SLO. Both 7-DHC and
8-DHC contribute substantially to the test result, given that they are accepted
substrates of cholesterol oxidase. All cholesterol methods making use of this
enzyme are expected to give unreliable results with plasma samples from SLO
patients. Cholesterol values found with these methods may be low-normal in
individual cases with SLO. Therefore, other techniques for measuring
cholesterol, 7-DHC, and 8-DHC, e.g., gas chromatography, should be used for
diagnosing these patients and for follow-up during therapy. However, a normal
value for plasma cholesterol, as obtained by gas chromatography, does not
exclude SLO. The diagnosis should always be confirmed or excluded by testing
for the presence of high concentrations of 7-DHC and 8-DHC in plasma. We found
that one patient with a severe form of the disease had a plasma cholesterol
concentration of 20 micromol/L-to our knowledge, the lowest value ever recorded
in a human being.<p>

AB: YM 9429 (cis-1-[4-(p-menthan-8-yloxy)phenyl]piperidine) is a hypolipidemic
agent with a potent and specific teratogenicity, inducing cleft palate and
skeletal variations in rats. Since cleft palate is generally observed in the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a common syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies
caused by reduced activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase (3
beta-hydroxysteroid delta 7-reductase), the final enzyme in the cholesterol
biosynthetic pathway, YM 9429 was suspected of being an inhibitor of this
enzyme. To prove this hypothesis, YM 9429 was added to cultured human skin
fibroblasts and to cultured Morris hepatoma cells and incubated with
[5-3H]mevalonolactone. After 24 h, radiolabeled 7-dehydrocholesterol
accumulated in the cells, whereas the formation of radiolabeled cholesterol was
markedly reduced. The results indicate that YM 9429 inhibits the conversion of
7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme
7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase. In rat liver microsomes, the mode of
inhibition was found to be noncompetitive, with a Ki of 40 microM. These
results suggest that YM 9429 induced developmental abnormalities in rats by the
same mechanism as the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. This compound might be useful
for studying the pathogenesis of anomalies in animal models of the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.<p>

AB: The impaired conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, as a result
of a permanent inhibition of the activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta
7-reductase, has been reported in the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome (1, 2).
For the purpose of experimental teratology, an animal disease model consisting
of the offspring of pregnant rats treated with AY 9944 or BM 15766, inhibitors
of 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase, was established. The present study
compares the profiles of sterols in rat serum, obtained after transient
treatment with inhibitors, with profiles of sterols obtained from patients with
the permanent enzyme defect. AY 9944 (single dose of 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg) or
BM 15766 (60, 75, or 90 mg/kg per day for 11 days) induces hypocholesterolemia
and accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol and aberrant sterols in rat serum. The
aberrant sterols in the treated rats are similar to those detected in human SLO
patients by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (1, 3, 4) and were
identified as 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol, two trienols (I and II), and
19-nor-5,7,9(10)-cholestatrien-3 beta-ol. The time- and dose-dependences of the
biochemical alterations are compared to the teratogenic abnormalities induced
by inhibitors. The dietary cholesterol supplementation that suppresses embryo
malformations induced by AY 9944 prevents severe hypocholesterolemia and
decreases the aberrant sterol levels. As a function of time after intoxication,
the 8-dehydrocholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol ratio increases, suggested
that 8-dehydrocholesterol is derived from the gradual conversion of the
accumulated 7-dehydrocholesterol. The ratio of 8-dehydrocholesterol to
7-dehydrocholesterol is higher in human SLO than in the animal disease model.
This may be explained by a permanent block in 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta
7-reductase in SLO compared to a transient inhibition of this enzyme in the
animal model.<p>

AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is caused by an inherited defect in
7-dehydrocholesterol-delta7-reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last
reaction in cholesterol biosynthesis, the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to
cholesterol. As a result, deficient cholesterol is produced and the precursor
7-dehydrocholesterol and derivatives (8-dehydrocholesterol and
19-nor-5,7,9(10)-cholestatrien-3 beta-ol) accumulate. Tissues (especially
brain) deprived of cholesterol, or because of the deposited sterol precursors
and derivatives, develop abnormally and function poorly. Replacement with
dietary cholesterol may help correct the biochemical defects and improve
symptoms.<p>

AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by dysmorphic facial features with abnormal limbs and genitalia.
Two forms have been recognized based on clinical course and severity: the
classical SLO (type I) and the lethal acrodysgenital syndrome (type II). Type I
SLO has been recently ascribed to a defect in cholesterol synthesis. Taking
advantage of a series of seven patients including five type I and two type II
SLO, we describe micrognathia, severe microcephaly, major ante and post natal
growth retardation and feeding difficulties as consistent features in the
disease. In addition, we give support to the presence of abnormal cholesterol
levels in the lethal acrodysgenital syndrome but find no correlation between
plasma sterol levels and the clinical severity of the disease. CONCLUSION: The
identification of the same biochemical defect in both types of
Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome suggests that despite major discrepancies in
clinical course and severity, type I and type II SLo are probably allelic
disorders.<p>

AB: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a common autosomal recessive disorder.
Children with SLOS present with specific facial dysmorphism and have multiple
congenital anomalies including cleft palate, congenital heart disease,
genitourinary anomalies, and limb abnormalities. They also manifest severe
failure to thrive and mental retardation. A metabolic defect at the final step
in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway has been described in SLOS patients.
This defect results in markedly reduced cholesterol levels and abnormal
accumulation of cholesterol precursors, particularly 7-dehydrocholesterol. This
newly described metabolic defect in humans is one of only a few metabolic
errors known to cause multiple birth defects. The biochemical profile of
reduced plasma cholesterol levels in association with markedly elevated levels
of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol is now used to confirm the
diagnosis of SLOS, which was formerly made on purely clinical grounds. This
biochemical abnormality has been confirmed in dozens of patients with SLOS in
both the United States and Europe. The severe cholesterol deficiency seen in
these patients has multiple effects on health and early childhood development,
because cholesterol is an essential component of many cell functions, which
explains many of the clinical findings seen in SLOS.<p>

AB: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a multiple congenital anomalies/mental
retardation disorder possibly due to a defect of delta 7-sterol reductase,
leading to low plasma cholesterol levels and to the accumulation of
7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and other cholesterol precursors. This study aimed
to identify clinical features that could potentially be specific indicators for
the clinical diagnosis of SLOS, and to test the reliability of ultraviolet
spectrophotometry (UVS) as a biochemical screening procedure for the syndrome.
Twenty patients with clinical suspicion of SLOS, referred to 11 Italian
paediatric and clinical genetic centres, were collected during 1994. In 10
patients the diagnosis was confirmed biochemically by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of serum sterols, whereas in the other 10
patients the serum sterol profiles were normal. A comparison between confirmed
SLOS patients and biochemically negative subjects did not show clinical signs
specific for the syndrome. UVS measurement of 7-DHC correlated well with GC/MS
profiles, showing 100% sensitivity and specificity. Four out of five patients
had serum bile acid concentrations below the normal range of controls.<p>

AB: In Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOs), 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)
accumulated because there is a block in the pathway for synthesis of
cholesterol via 7-DHC. Prenatal diagnosis of SLOs has been achieved by analysis
of 7-DHC in amniotic fluid obtained at 16-18 wk from pregnancies at risk. The
purpose of this study was to investigate 7-DHC and cholesterol concentrations
in chorionic villus (CV) samples with a view to performing first trimester
prenatal diagnosis. Using a sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
assay it was possible to detect 7-DHC in CV samples obtained as early as 7 wk
of gestation. The ration of 7-DHC to cholesterol in placental tissue was shown
to be relatively constant over the gestational period of 7-18 wk. We therefore
proceeded to analyze the 7-DHC/cholesterol ration in CV samples taken at 10-12
wk of gestation from three pregnancies at risk for SLOs. The results were as
follows: patient A, 1.10 x 10(-3); patient B, 1.80 x 10(-3); patient C, 0.091;
control range for CVS (8-12 wk), 3.10 x 10(-4) to 1.62 x 10(-3) (mean +/- 2SD;
n = 5). The fetus of patient C was diagnosed as affected by SLOs, and the
parents requested termination. Analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed
the diagnosis. Pregnancies A and B were diagnosed unaffected, and this was
confirmed first by amniocentesis and then by the birth of normal infants at
term. We conclude that synthesis of cholesterol via 7-DHC is occurring in the
placenta and/or fetus at 10 wk of gestation and that prenatal diagnosis by CV
biopsy is possible.<p>

AB: Patients with the autosomal recessive disorder Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome
(SLO) have recently been shown to have markedly increased tissue levels of
certain cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates, most notably
7-dehydrocholesterol. The findings strongly suggest a block in the step that
catalyses reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. The accumulation of
7-dehydrocholesterol can generally easily be detected in serum by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, it could not be totally ruled out
that SLO patients with less severe enzyme defects could escape detection by
this method. A more direct way of diagnosing a defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol
reduction would be to assay the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to
cholesterol in cultured fibroblasts from patients with suspected SLO. In the
present work, an assay for the conversion of [3H]lathosterol to [3H]cholesterol
in cultured human fibroblasts is described. Lathosterol is the immediate
precursor of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and
was chosen for the assay instead of 7-dehydrocholesterol owing to the
difficulty in preparation and handling of the latter compound. Fibroblasts from
control subjects converted [3H]lathosterol to [3H]cholesterol efficiently,
whereas in fibroblasts from SLO patients the conversion did not go beyond
7-dehydrocholesterol. It is concluded that the present method is useful for the
diagnosis of SLO.<p>

philtrum, broad dental ridges, schisis of the palatum molle, retrognathia, a
small penis with a chorda, a small scrotum, bilateral inguinal hernia and
bilateral syndactyly of the second and third toes were observed. The presence
of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome was suspected. By gas chromatography a
severely decreased plasma cholesterol level (0.27 mmol/l) was found and an
increased plasma 7-dehydrocholesterol level (0.24 mmol/l). The SLO syndrome is
caused by a block in the cholesterol biosynthesis due to the autosomal
recessive deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. The patient's condition
improved with use of a cholesterol-enriched diet.<p>

AB: We have identified the third unknown sterol in the plasma and tissues of
Smith-Lemli-Opitz homozygotes as 19-nor-5,7,9(10)-cholestatrien-3 beta-ol. The
structure was established from capillary gas-liquid chromatography retention
index and characteristic fragmentation pattern by mass spectrometry that were
identical to a synthetic reference standard. Evidence is presented that
19-nor-5,7,9(10)-cholestatrien-3 beta-ol is not an artifact formed during the
chemical isolation of the relatively unstable 7-dehydrocholesterol. It is
possible that 19-nor-5,7,9(10)-cholestatrien-3 beta-ol may contribute to the
clinical abnormalities in patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.<p>

AB: Amniocentesis was performed at 17.3 weeks in a pregnancy with severe
intrauterine growth retardation. Cytogenetic studies on amniocytes were normal,
46,XX, and the pregnancy was continued. The diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome was suspected in the neonatal period and confirmed by the presence of
7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in the plasma (0.4 mmol/l, normal = not
detectable) associated with a low total cholesterol concentration (0.4 mmol/l,
normal = 2.56 +/- 0.23). Retrospective analysis of the amniotic fluid sample
revealed an elevated level of 7-DHC (0.022 mmol/l; normal = undetectable).
Therefore measurement of 7-DHC levels in amniotic fluid during the second
trimester of pregnancy is useful for the prenatal diagnosis of
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in families at risk and should be considered in
cases of severe growth retardation of unknown aetiology for which amniotic
fluid is available and in which a normal chromosomal pattern in amniocytes is
present.<p>

family history of genetic disease demonstrated increased accumulation of fluid
in the fetal nuchal region. In view of the association of this defect with
chromosomal abnormalities, fetal karyotyping was performed by chorion villus
sampling and this demonstrated a normal 46,XY karyotype. Subsequent scans
showed resolution of the nuchal fluid, and at the 20-week scan the fetal
genitalia appeared to be female. Fetal blood sampling confirmed a normal male
karyotype and fetoscopy confirmed the presence of female external genitalia.
The parents elected to terminate the pregnancy, and postmortem findings were
indicative of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. This was confirmed by the finding of
increased levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol in cultured skin fibroblasts.<p>

AB: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a common birth defect syndrome
characterized biochemically by low plasma cholesterol levels and high
concentrations of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol. The present
study was undertaken to prove that the enzyme defect is at the step in which
7-dehydrocholesterol is converted into cholesterol and to establish a new
biochemical method for the diagnosis of this disease. We assayed the latter
part of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway by incubating [3H]lathosterol (the
immediate precursor of 7-dehydrocholesterol) with cultured skin fibroblasts
from 15 homozygous patients, 14 obligate heterozygous parents, and 8 controls,
and measuring its conversion to 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol. The
formation of cholesterol from lathosterol in parents was not significantly
different from that in controls. In contrast, cells from patients made very
little cholesterol (P &lt; 0.0001, patients vs. parents or vs. controls) but
readily converted lathosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. The defect was
especially profound in a subgroup of 8 of the most severely clinically affected
patients, as virtually no label was detected in the cholesterol fraction. These
results provide compelling evidence that 1) this disease is caused by a primary
defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase, an essential enzyme in the
biosynthesis of cholesterol; 2) the most clinically severe form of the syndrome
may be associated with the most inhibited enzyme; and 3) the enzyme lathosterol
5-desaturase that converts lathosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol is fully intact.
The present method using fibroblast and amniocyte cultures establishes it as a
useful procedure for the biochemical diagnosis of this syndrome.<p>

AB: We investigated the enzyme defect in late cholesterol biosynthesis in the
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a recessively inherited developmental disorder
characterized by facial dysmorphism, mental retardation, and multiple organ
congenital anomalies. Reduced plasma and tissue cholesterol with increased
7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations are biochemical features diagnostic of the
inherited enzyme defect. Using isotope incorporation assays, we measured the
transformation of the precursors, [3 alpha- 3H]lathosterol and
[1,2-3H]7-dehydrocholesterol into cholesterol by liver microsomes from seven
controls and four Smith-Lemli-Opitz homozygous subjects. The introduction of
the double bond in lathosterol at C-5[6] to form 7-dehydrocholesterol that is
catalyzed by lathosterol-5-dehydrogenase was equally rapid in controls and
homozygotes liver microsomes (120 +/- 8 vs 100 +/- 7 pmol/mg protein per min, P
= NS). In distinction, the reduction of the double bond at C-7 [8] in
7-dehydrocholesterol to yield cholesterol catalyzed by
7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase was nine times greater in controls than
homozygotes microsomes (365 +/- 23 vs 40 +/- 4 pmol/mg protein per min, P &lt;
0.0001). These results demonstrate that the pathway of lathosterol to
cholesterol in human liver includes 7-dehydrocholesterol as a key intermediate.
In Smith-Lemli-Opitz homozygotes, the transformation of 7-dehydrocholesterol to
cholesterol by hepatic microsomes was blocked although 7-dehydrocholesterol was
produced abundantly from lathosterol. Thus, lathosterol 5-dehydrogenase is
equally active which indicates that homozygotes liver microsomes are viable.
Accordingly, microsomal 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase is inherited

AB: BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a recessive
inherited disorder characterized by neurological developmental defects and
dysmorphic features with a defect in cholesterol synthesis at the conversion of
7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. BM 15.766 inhibits
7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase and reproduces the biochemical defect.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cholesterol, cholic
acid, and lovastatin feeding on rats fed BM 15.766. METHODS: Plasma cholesterol
and 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations were related to the hepatic
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. RESULTS: With the
inhibitor treatment, plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased 67%;
7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations increased from trace to 17 mg/dL; and
hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and messenger RNA levels were stimulated 74%
and two times, respectively. In inhibitor-treated rats, feeding cholesterol
increased plasma cholesterol concentrations 3.7 times, decreased
7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations 88%, and reduced elevated HMG-CoA reductase
activity and messenger RNA levels 74% and 49%. Feeding cholic acid increased
plasma cholesterol without reducing 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations. The
combination of cholic acid and cholesterol enhanced plasma cholesterol 9.5
times without decreasing 7-dehydrocholesterol levels. Feeding lovastatin
depressed plasma cholesterol further without reducing 7-dehydrocholesterol
levels. CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol is essential to correct abnormal cholesterol
synthesis induced by BM 15.766 in rats by expanding the pool and inhibiting
HMG-CoA reductase. Neither cholic acid nor lovastatin are effective separately,
but cholic acid plus cholesterol may offer some additional benefit.<p>
