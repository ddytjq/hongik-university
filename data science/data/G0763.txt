<h1>What's a Penrose diagram?</h1>
<a href="spacetime.html">Spacetime diagrams</a> are all well and good for
standard static black holes.  You can fit the event horizon and the
singularity in one picture with no problems.  However, that is not so with
charged and rotating black holes, for there are two event horizons to deal
with, as well as the possiblity for recrossing those horizons.  Roger
Penrose developed a different kind of spacetime diagram for dealing with
the more complex nature of the charged and rotating black holes.<img

It would be good to start with something basic, and static black holes are
as basic as you can get.  Above are two diagrams of an eternal static
black hole.  To the left is the spacetime diagram.  To the right is the
Penrose diagram.  As you can see, it looks much like the spacetime diagram
for a black hole---with one exception.  Where the spacetime diagram
projects off into infinity, the Penrose diagram ends in clean, neat pointy
lines.  Hmm!  If you look closely at the labels, you'll notice that
nothing actually changed except that this diagram is self-contained.  No
little arrows pointing off into infinity.  Instead, we have points and
lines that designate the different infinities.
<p>
In our universe (the one on the right) there are only five distinct
directions: future infinity, right future infinity, right infinity, right
past infinity, and past infinity. A worldline from a spacetime diagram
might go from the past infinity to the future infinity.  Light rays go off
into the right future infinity and come from the right past infinity (that
whole 45&#176 thing).  Only a line of simultaneity could go to the right
infinity, which makes sense.  With respect to an inertial observer, that
line of simultaneity goes on forever.  Objects still cross and cannot
recross the event horizon and run into the singularity.  Objects from one
universe can't cross over into another.  All is well with this diagram, it
follows our rules.
