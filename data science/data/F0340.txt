    create both the treeview and listview common controls at runtime</strong><br>
    <br>
    This example is busy. Not only does it create both the treeview and listview common
    controls at runtime through the API (no Comctl32.ocx); subclass the controls' parent
    window, a VB Form, allowing the receipt of control window notification messages; implement
    both the IShellFolder interface, and IShellFolder's child interface, the IEnumIDList
    interface while processing the notifications; it also enumerates the shell's namespace and
    displays the names and icons of any and all file system objects in each control. Other
    interesting Explorer-like behavior is thrown in, including right-click context menu
    functionality with help from the IContextMenu interface, and for good measure, a
    deceivingly simple little splitter bar is used to simultaneously adjust the size of both
    control windows within the Form. Other various (and subtle) Explorer-like functionality is
    also demonstrated.<br>
    <br>
    This VB example is based on, and ported directly from, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/wtop.htm">EnumDesk</a> C example found in the
    Microsoft Developer's Network Premium library and in Nancy Cluts' book <a href="http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/books/platform/win95ui/f6/d9/chpt14-01.htm">&quot;Programming
    the Windows 95 User Interface&quot;</a> from the Microsoft Press. Due to the relative
    complexity of the C example, some interesting tricks were employed in order to get the
    code to work in VB. Not only is the IUnknown interface used directly in place of VB's
    &quot;Set&quot; statement, but memory pointers to everything, including interface object
    references, structures (VB Types), strings and anything else, are thrown around by the
    MoveMemory (AKA CopyMemory) function as frequently as variables are Dim'd.<br>
    <br>
    For the sake of completeness, the example includes the *entire* complement of treeview,
    listview and imagelist C definitions and macros converted to VB code (with the exception
    of CustomDraw), and contains some rather handy general purpose error, string, shell, and
    window procedure debugging code. The source code is fairly heavily documented as well.<br>

    03/12/99, Revision 2:<br>
    <br>
    It's been exactly a year and a half from its initial release, and this demo has finally
    been completely rewritten and extensively updated. All known bugs have been corrected, and
    fair amount of new functionality has been added. See demo's _Readme.txt file for more
    information.<br>
