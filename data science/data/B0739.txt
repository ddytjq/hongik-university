  <font color="red">THE REDS SAVER ACCOUNT</b></font>
  <br>
  The Reds Saver Account has been developed as a partnership between Barnsley Football Club and Barnsley Building Society. It is an affinity account for supporters who benefit with an attractive savings account, which also benefits the Club’s finances at the same time, as the Society guarantees to pay an annual bonus.
  <br><br>

  Account investors have the security of their investments being held in a savings plan with a mutual building society, whilst having the ability to support the Club long term, through the annual bonus payment, which equates to a percentage of the daily balances held under the Reds Saver Account name. This payment is made by the Society.
  <br><br>

  Opening a Reds Saver Account means you're supporting your finances with one of the most attractive instant access accounts available, as well as putting your money where your mouth is and showing your full support by assisting your Club financially. <b><i>And the more you save, the better it gets!</i></b>
  <br><br>

  <font color="red"><b>AVAILABILITY</b></font>

  CHILDREN UNDER 7 (ACCOUNTS IN TRUST). Accounts can be opened for children under 7 by a responsible adult who is willing to operate the account as a trustee. Once the child is of an age where they wish to operate the account themselves, the account can be simply transferred into their own name.
  <br><br>

  As a trustee you will be required to provide proof of identity and home address for both yourself and the child involved.
  <br><br>

  <br><br>

  <font color="red"><b>INTEREST PAYMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  The Reds Saver Account has only one interest rate no matter whether you save £10 or up to the account maximum of £50,000. The interest earned on your account is paid annually on the 31st December and can either be credited to your account or paid to another account with the Society.
  <br><br>  

  <font color="red"><b>REDS SAVER BONUS PAYMENT</b></font>
  <br>
  A bonus payment is made to the Club, from the Society, annually on the 30th April.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="red"><b>INCOME TAX</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest will be payable either net of lower rate income tax, which may be reclaimed by non-tax payers or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society’s Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have <a class=s5 href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html" target=_blank>Adobe Acrobat Reader</a> click <a class=s5 href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/r85.pdf" target=_blank>here to download the R85 form</a>.
  <br><br>

  You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate due.
  <br><br>  

  The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with particulars of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.
