<H3>Physical overview</H3>
In the early universe all atoms were completely ionized, and radiation
was strongly coupled to matter by the Compton scattering of photons
off of the free electrons.  Regions of overdensity began to
collapse and heat up, until the pressure rose to the point where
the overdense region would rebound and cool off.
As the universe expanded, these oscillations continued until the CMB
temperature fell to the point that electrons and protons could
"recombine" into neutral atoms.  Regions of high and low density at this
epoch correspond to hot and cold spots on the sky, respectively,
as is seen in the COBE sky map or the simulated map below.
After this recombination, the CMB was
no longer coupled to matter; however, photons 
become gravitationally redshifted as they flow out of 
the potential wells created by dense regions.

<H3> Power spectrum of the anisotropies.  </H3>

The anisotropies in the CMB can be characterized in terms of multipole
moments, by decomposing the temperature map into spherical harmonic
components.  The rms power for spherical harmonic components of angular
degree <EM>l</EM> is <IMG SRC="./IMAGES/fig010.gif" ALT="C_l">
(it is dimensionless because the mean temperature
2.726 K has been divided out).  A given <EM>l</EM> corresponds approximately
to angular scale 180/<EM>l</EM> degrees.
Multiplying
<IMG SRC="./IMAGES/fig010.gif" ALT="C_l">
by <EM>l</EM>(<EM>l</EM>+1) gives
the total power per logarithmic range of wavenumbers.
<A HREF="eqn_cl.html">More information</A> is available on the angular
power spectrum and its Fourier pair, the two-point correlation function.

The points in the plot shown above 
are experimental measurements of the CMB anisotropy.
The leftmost point (in turquoise) is the COBE two-year data
(<A HREF="sc95bib.html">Gorski et al.</A>),
probing an angular scale of ten degrees. The other points are from
balloon flights (in blue) or ground-based experiments (in red);
these data are available as part of the 
<A HREF="sc95bib.html"> COSAPP </A> 
software package made available by Rahul Dave
and Paul Steinhardt at the University of Pennsylvania.
<P>
The curves show the output of PLINGER runs, normalized to the COBE data.
Each run took 17 hours on 64 nodes of the SP2.
The dotted, black curve shows  a standard CDM model with
Hubble constant <EM>H</EM>=50 km/s/Mpc.
The solid, green curve is for a model with a set of parameters
chosen to be most in agreement with the observational data
(<A HREF="sc95bib.html">Ostriker and Steinhardt 1995</A>).
This latter model contains a cosmological constant, has a
lower baryon fraction and a higher Hubble constant 
than the CDM model, and has a different spectrum of 
initial perturbations (with slightly less small-scale power).
In models with a cosmological constant, CMB photons are traveling
through
a changing potential, which leads to larger anisotropies around the
first acoustic peak.  The anisotropy decreases on smaller scales (larger
<em>l</em>) because of the tilted primeval spectral slope.
<P>
The largest peak occurs at about <EM>l</EM>=200 in both curves; the position of
this peak depends mostly on the total density (including the
cosmological constant) of the universe, which is the same in the two
models. Increased accuracy in the measurement and theoretical prediction
of the power spectrum will help to discriminate between cosmological
models and give constraints on important parameters such as
<EM>H</EM> and the density.
<P>
The results of PLINGER show good agreement with similar codes; for
example, the <EM>H</EM>=50 CDM power spectrum
shown above differs from that of 
<A HREF="sc95bib.html">Sugiyama 1995</A> by less than
0.5% for <EM>l</EM> &lt; 1000.

<A HREF="anim001.mpg">Movie: Evolution of the Potential</A> (264 KB)
</H3>

This mpeg movie shows the evolution of the potential,
<A HREF="eqn_mn.html">psi</A>, of the
conformal Newtonian gauge; psi plays the role of the gravitational
potential in the Newtonian limit.  The square is a comoving 100 Mpc
across (1 pc = 3.3 light years). Standard Cold Dark Matter initial
conditions are used. The movie ends shortly after recombination, at
conformal time 250 Mpc (expansion factor 1/<EM>a</EM> = 1028,
or redshift <EM>z</EM> =1027;
recombination occurs at about <EM>z</EM>=1300).  The initial spatial
pattern of the potential is a statistical fractal owing to the
scale-invariant fluctuations we assume were generated by cosmic
inflation during the first femtosecond after the big bang.  Acoustic
waves cause the potential fluctuations to spread and damp during
the radiation-dominated phase of the early universe.  This evolution
of the potential produces the small angular scale features in the
CMB anisotropy map shown above. 
The potential becomes almost constant after the universe becomes
matter-dominated.

<A HREF="anim002.mpg">Movie: Evolution of the Density</A> (1080 KB)
</H3>

This mpeg movie shows the evolution of the net density fluctuations
in the CDM model corresponding to the potential movie above.  Green
corresponds to the mean density; blue regions are underdense and
red ones are overdense.
The density movie runs only half as long because once the universe
becomes matter-dominated at a redshift <EM>z</EM>=6000,
the density fluctuations
grow in proportion with the cosmic expansion factor (corresponding
to a constant gravitational potential),  saturating the linear color
scale that we use.
The density pattern has finer
structure than the potential, to which it is related (via the
general relativistic form of the Poisson equation) by two spatial
derivatives.
