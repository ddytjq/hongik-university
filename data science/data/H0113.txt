<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Executive Summary</P>
</B><P>Structural biology and especially macromolecular crystallography are playing an
increasingly important role in biological discoveries. In order to achieve these breakthroughs,
macromolecular crystallography has dramatically expanded its use of the nation's synchrotron
sources. These developments have led to the reconvening of the Structural Biology
Subcommittee of the Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee (BERAC) to
review the needs and to make recommendations as to the resources and processes that are
necessary for the proper support of the macromolecular crystallographic community at the
synchrotrons. The Subcommittee met on July 13, 1998; this document is the product of those
deliberations. The major issues addressed by the Subcommittee and its recommendations are as
follows:</P>
<B><P>Improvements recommended for current beamlines</B> (for the purposes of this report,
beamline is defined throughout as an independently operating station, i.e., an experimental
station/hutch.)</P>
<P>Since the number of beamlines currently in use or in construction for macromolecular
crystallography has increased significantly in the past six to seven years, it was the sense of the
Subcommittee that, from an efficiency, productivity, and timeliness perspective, the first priority
should be to upgrade these existing beamlines to maximize utilization. This involves the
following investments:</P>

<OL>

<P><LI><I>Staffing:</I> increases are recommended in staffing at the rate of one
FTE/beamline, on average, to improve round-the-clock user support, increase efficiency of
operation, and better provide for less-experienced and non-specialist users. The Subcommittee
regards this as a minimal increase relative to what is really needed for a fully efficient and
functional operation.<BR>
<I>Estimated cost: annual incremental expenditure of $3M/yr (~$125K/FTE).

</I><P><LI><I>Hardware upgrades:</I> improved hardware such as newer CCD detectors,
backup detectors to avoid time wasting catastrophic failures, and improved optics and
instrumentation to increase beam intensity or broaden versatility of a beamline.<BR>
&#9;<I>Estimated cost: initial expenditure of ~$10M. Estimated annual capital requirement of
$250K/yr/beamline to maintain effective state of hardware (some of which is already accounted
for in existing budgets).</P></ol>

</I><B><P>Improved access process for synchrotron beamtime and user education</P>
</B><P>Increased use and modern demands of research requires changing the way beamtime is
allocated:</P><DIR>

<P>1.&#9;Rapid access to beamtime within a month or two using rolling reviews.<BR>
2.&#9;Regional or facility-wide access system for time slot applications.<BR>
3.&#9;Increase number of longer term "program" allocations.<BR>
4.&#9;Provide for "instant access" for hour-long time blocks for sample evaluation. <BR>
5.&#9;Development of common cross-facility user-friendly graphics interfaces across
beamlines.<BR>
6.&#9;Institute programs, such as workshops, to educate less-experienced and non-specialist
users.</P></DIR>

</B><P><LI>The Subcommittee supports the recommendations of the Birgeneau/Shen
<FONT FACE="Times">Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) </FONT>report
urging continued funding of sustained basic operations for all four DOE synchrotrons. The
Subcommittee also supports the beamline upgrades for APS and NSLS (priority 2) and the
facility upgrades for NSLS and SSRL (priority 2.5), recommended by Birgeneau/Shen, as
necessary for continued support of the macromolecular crystallographic community.</P>
<P><LI>Funding of the operating shortfall of CHESS by NSF at ~$0.5M/yr.</P></ol>

<B><P>Future research efforts: Detector, automation, and methodology development</P>
</B><P>To foster continued expansion of facility access, efficiency, and capabilities, the
Subcommittee recommends support of research in:</P><ol>

<P><LI>Advanced detectors
<LI>Develop beamline automation
<LI>Methodology development, such as optimizing data collection, processing, and refinement
strategies to enhance synchrotron use. Development of new web-based tools to permit active
access to beamline experimentation by remote users.</P></ol>

<B><P>New beamlines</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times"><P>A number of crystallography beamlines are currently in the
commissioning, development, or proposal stage at six of the synchrotron facilities. The
Subcommittee urges a case-by-case review of new beamline proposals by funding agencies with
weight given to innovative applications.</P>
</FONT><B><P>I.&#9;Introduction and charge of the Subcommittee</P>
</B><P>The progress of molecular biological research depends increasingly on knowledge of
macromolecular crystal structures. Advances in our understanding of many basic biological
systems, as well as powerful new methodology for structure-based drug design, have come
directly as a result of the empowering information provided by atomic resolution macromolecular
structures derived from crystallography. The growing demand for new crystal structures has
created an urgent need to improve access to synchrotron radiation for macromolecular
crystallography. Consequently, the past decade has seen a rapid expansion of structural biology
and, especially, macromolecular protein crystallography at the nation's synchrotrons. This
expansion and the impact it is having can be measured in a number of ways. In the course of just
five years (see Table 1), the number of structures deposited in the protein databank has almost
tripled, the number of new structures published using synchrotron radiation has grown from 16%
to 40% and the number of beamlines at the nation's six synchrotrons with capabilities for protein
crystallography has increased five-fold. The<BR>

<P>Over the past year, three different studies have been conducted that have reviewed the use of
synchrotron radiation by the structural biology community. The Birgeneau/Shen report of the
Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) of the Department of Energy, the 1997
BioSync report (an update of the original report issued in 1991), and the Hodgson/Lattman report
all examined various facets of this issue. These reports document the recent expansion of the
crystallographic use of synchrotrons and forecast a sustained, continued, dramatic growth in the
use of synchrotron sources for macromolecular crystallography for the foreseeable future. As a
consequence of this conclusion, the Structural Biology Subcommittee was requested to consider
the opportunities facing the granting agencies of the United States government in providing for
the anticipated needs of macromolecular crystallography at synchrotron facilities. While a
number of techniques comprise the synchrotron usage of structural biology, the Subcommittee
was requested to focus on macromolecular crystallography because this discipline currently
forms the largest segment, by far, of structural biology users at synchrotrons and is placing the
highest demands on capacity.</P>
<P>The issues considered by the Subcommittee were devoted to two major areas of concern:
</P>
<P>1.&#9;Consideration of the expected user needs</P><DIR>

<P>a.&#9;Expected rate of increase of usage<BR>
b.&#9;What types of facilities will be needed: monochromatic, MAD, Laue, high brightness,
etc.<BR>
c.&#9;How should beamtime be scheduled: need for rapid access, immediate access, should
scheduling be regional, by beamline, or national system<BR>
d.&#9;User support vs. methods development<BR>
e.&#9;"Non-specialist" user needs at beamlines<BR>
f.&#9;Issues of training and education</P></DIR>

<P>2.&#9;Assessment of the status of existing facilities and need for further
facilities</P><DIR>

<P>a.&#9;Beamline staff needed<BR>
b.&#9;Beamline hardware needed<BR>
c.&#9;Increase in number of beamlines<BR>
d.&#9;Synchrotron upgrades</P></DIR>

<P>After discussion of the above issues, the recommendations of the Subcommittee, in order of
importance, were as follows:</P>
<B><P>II.&#9;Improvements recommended for current beamlines</P>
</B><P>The Subcommittee concluded that the optimization of existing beamline utilization for
protein crystallography will provide the greatest benefit most rapidly and is, therefore, of highest,
most immediate priority. This can be most readily achieved through staffing increases and
hardware upgrades at existing or soon to be completed beamlines. Such investments are viewed
as a very cost effective way to leverage the current considerable investment in beamlines and
user support for protein crystallography research and significantly increase capacity to meet the
existing and growing level of overdemand. </P>
<I><P>Staffing</P>
</I><P>The two BioSync reports (1991 and 1997) and the recent Hodgson/Lattman report have
documented the chronic understaffing of protein crystallography beamlines; the 1997 BioSync
report concludes: "The most important need is for increased funding support for scientific and
technical staffing at the synchrotron facilities." Appropriate staffing impacts the efficient
operation of beamlines at every level: user support, proper hardware operation, implementation
of hardware upgrades and new technologies, beamline administration and scheduling, safety
issues, and user training. The user-support issue was noted by the Birgeneau-Shen BESAC
subcommittee to be a substantial concern at many beamlines, and one can anticipate that this
need will only increase with the rise in less-specialized and "non-specialist" users. The staffing
requirement for hardware operation, maintenance, and upgrading is self-evident. Finally, the
effective implementation of rapid access protocols to beamlines (see below), listed as a
substantial concern by users in the BioSync survey, will require appropriate staff to implement
and administer development of streamlined web-based tools for proposal review and rapid
scheduling.</P>
<P>Staffing levels must be adequate to permit round-the-clock usage to maximally utilize the
available synchrotron radiation. The storage rings operate typically 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 9
or more months/year, thus creating a significant burden on sustaining effective and reliable
beamline operations. Current staffing levels at protein crystallography beamlines average ~2.5
FTE/beamline, as documented in the Hodgson/Lattman survey of synchrotron facilities; on
average, at least one additional FTE/beamline was indicated as being required by the facility
operators to have a reasonably effective level. The Subcommittee discussed appropriate staffing
levels at length, and concluded that 3.5 to 4 dedicated FTE/beamline on average was a
<U>minimal</U> target for the goal of optimizing efficient beamline utilization and maximizing
throughput. It might be noted that this is still well below the optimal level of 5 to 7 recommended
by the first BioSync report. </P>
<P>These 3.5 to 4 FTEs represent (1) a staff scientist (or beamline scientist) responsible for
overall beamline operation as well as participating in research and technological developments;
(2) a beamline engineer (typically B.S. or M.S. level) who understands the major systems, optics,
etc., as well as providing user support; (3) a technician, primarily for mechanical issues such as
alignment, crystal changes, checkouts, maintenance, etc.; (4) a part-time administrator to
schedule beamtime, arrange training, etc.; and (5) software and electronics technician support
(assuming the beamline technician handles mechanical problems) are also required for some
subset of beamlines. If these beamlines have common detectors, operating software, etc., then
more efficient staff utilization can be achieved. Under these conditions, one software and one
electronics technicians could service ~4 beamlines. Scheduling and administration of beamlines
requires ~1 FTE/4 beamlines. Safety officers are also essential, and will likely require additional
staffing with the development of new sample handling techniques for crystal cooling, gas
pressurization, and heavy atom derivatization (particularly with increased sample throughput), in
addition to monitoring of any biohazards. Thus, a total of 3.5-4 FTEs are needed per beamline
(assuming sharing of the software, electronics, administrative and safety support among about 4
total beamlines). </P>
<P>It is important to point out that the minimal staffing levels recommended above do not,
however, provide for significant scientific support that would be needed by large numbers of less
experienced and "non-specialist" investigators.</P>
<I><P>Budgetary considerations:</I> The cost of adding an incremental 1FTE/beamline, on
average, to the ~24 protein crystallography beamlines comes to a total annual incremental
expenditure of ~$3M, assuming $125K average cost including benefits and overhead per FTE
(based on the Hodgson/Lattman report).</P>
<I><P>Hardware Upgrades</P>
</I><P>Many protein crystallography beamlines have proposed upgrading their present detector
with either a CCD or a later generation, faster readout image plate system (Hodgson/Lattman
Report). By reducing the detector readout time, the efficiency of synchrotron beam utilization can
be increased by a factor between two to four. This would have an immediate and dramatic effect
on sample, and hence user, throughput. However, it must be recognized that increased operations
costs are associated with these more advanced detectors. A related and significant request is for
backup detector capabilities, in the event of accidental damage or other catastrophic failure of
critical detectors. The consequences of a detector failure can create loss of weeks of data
collection time for scheduled users who may have waited months for access to the beamline.
Ideally, each facility would have a backup detector to minimize loss of beamtime due to
instrument failure. Where a commonality of detectors exists, such backup detectors could be
"shared" by several beamlines. </P>
<P>In addition to detector replacements/upgrades, other components of the beamlines, in
particular the optical components like mirrors and monochromators, have finite lifetimes and
need to be replaced periodically due to radiation damage or to accommodate ring upgrades. More
recent developments in optics and instrumentation could also be profitably retrofitted into some
existing beamlines to improve their performance and reliability, as well as confer new
capabilities (e.g. rapid tunability for MAD or polychromatic capability for Laue data collection).
</P>
<I><P>Budgetary considerations:</I> From the facilities surveyed in the Hodgson/Lattman
report, initial hardware upgrades of ~$10M were requested for protein crystallography beamlines.
For budgeting purposes, the average annual capital requirement for hardware upgrades is
estimated to be ~$250K/beamline (this figure was provided by Dr. Roland Hirsch of DOE-BER
based on average capital needs of currently operating DOE supported beamlines), for a total of
~$6M/year for 24 beamlines. </P>
<I><P>General budgetary considerations: </I>It should be noted that DOE-BES, DOE-BER, and
NIH-NCRR are already investing some funding to address these issues and completely new funds
in these amounts are not required. The details would need to be sorted out when the appropriate
review and allocation mechanism for new funds was defined and initiated. Furthermore, it should
be emphasized, that while some of the beamlines referred to as currently operational for
macromolecular crystallography are privately resourced, the funding requested here will
significantly enhance the general user access that is required of all beamlines at the current
synchrotron beamlines.</P>
<B><P>III.&#9;Improved access process for synchrotron beamtime and user education </P>
</B><P>Increasing the capacity and number of beamlines by implementing the
recommendations outlined above and below will produce the most significant improvement in
beamtime for the user population. However, in order to optimize user access to these facilities,
important procedural improvements are urgently needed in two areas. The first is to develop a
suitable process to streamline the review of proposals and speed the assignment of beamtime.
The second is to broaden access to synchrotron radiation within the biological community.</P>
<P>Under the current system for review of proposals and assignment of beamtime, the time
between beam-time request and experiment is generally very long (many months). This is poorly
matched to today's rapid pace of research in structural molecular biology and to the highly
competitive nature of many structural projects. We recommend that operators of synchrotron
facilities and the user community, with encouragement from the funding agencies, develop a plan
for more rapid and streamlined access for macromolecular crystallography. The committee
discussed several specific ideas for improving access. </P><ul>

<P><LI>A rolling review of proposals for single experiments should be instituted, requiring
neither specific proposal deadlines nor review committee meetings. Review times should ideally
be about a month and, therefore, beamtime for such experiments would be scheduled only about
two months in advance. </P>
<LI>Since the overwhelming number of users preferred regional
access to a synchrotron source, we encourage development of a single point of entry for
general-user proposals at each synchrotron facility and perhaps regionally. It would also be useful
to standardize the beamtime access application forms across facilities, since users often have to
apply to more than one facility in order to obtain beamtime in a timely fashion.</P>
<LI>The number of long-term "programs" of structural research,
as implemented at some synchrotron facilities, should be expanded to include more specialist
investigators with funded research programs in structural biology. </P>
<LI>Where possible, a system for "instant access" to hour-long
blocks of time for sample evaluation should be implemented. </P>
<LI>Since users receive time at different beamlines on different
visits, there is a significant benefit to be gained by developing a common cross-facility
user-friendly graphics interface that would present the user with the same or similar user
environment regardless of which beamline they are working out on this particular visit. This is
especially important for the less expert users whose participation in synchrotron research is
increasing.</P></ul>

<P>Macromolecular crystallography is rapidly becoming a standard tool of biological research.
This trend speeds the advancement of biology by expanding the array of problems that are
subjected to structural study. Thus, it is important to broaden access to synchrotron radiation for
non-specialist users in the molecular biology community. Improved training for non-specialist
users is important in addition to providing beamtime and support for experiment. We strongly
encourage development of workshops and other venues for training non-specialist or less
specialist users in the practice of macromolecular crystallography.</P>
<I><P>Budgetary considerations:</I> There will be some administrative overhead needed for a
centralized facility or regional access process as well as for organizing and executing effective
training programs and workshops. However, the budgetary costs to implement appropriate access
mechanisms and educational programs are relatively small.</P>
<B><P>IV.&#9;General Facility Operations and Upgrades</P>
</B><P>The Subcommittee discussed the need for effectively sustaining basic operations and
upgrades of the synchrotron facilities currently being used for, or with potential to soon
contribute to, beamtime for structural molecular biology experiments.</P>
<P>Highly reliable and stable operation of the storage ring sources is one of several key and
essential components in the successful development and remarkable growth of synchrotron-based
protein crystallography over the last decade. Sustainable running of the storage rings for typically
9 or more months per year with minimal down time and high beam stability enables users to rely
upon synchrotron sources for their x-ray diffraction data collection needs. This will increasingly
be the case if the access issues discussed earlier in this report can be mitigated. Hence it is
important to recognize the importance of providing adequate funding for the ongoing operations
of the facilities themselves and for facility upgrades that improve overall performance and
reliability to the benefit of the whole user community which includes a growing fraction of
structural biologists at all of the facilities.</P>
<P>Continued effective operation of the CHESS facility is an issue of immediate concern. The
Subcommittee endorses the conclusion of the Birgeneau/Shen report that a single funding agency
should maintain responsibility for the operating costs of a given facility. However, the shortfall
of CHESS operating funds at the currently projected level of funding will likely have an
immediate and negative impact on protein crystallography users through reduced beamline
support. We urge that the NSF allocate additional funds to address the projected shortfall of
about $0.5M/yr in the CHESS operations budget.</P>
<P>The four DOE-funded synchrotron sources (APS, ALS, NSLS, and SSRL) have recently
undergone an exhaustive and thorough review by the Birgeneau/Shen BESAC subcommittee.
The report issued by this group in October, 1997 directly addresses and prioritizes the funding
needs for ongoing operation and upgrades of these four facilities. In particular, the
Birgeneau/Shen report recommends continued operation of all four of the DOE synchrotrons,
funding for new beamline and front end upgrades at NSLS and APS, and major facility upgrades
for NSLS and SSRL. Front ends and beamlines at APS and improvements to the NSLS PRT
beamlines are relevant to enhanced access and future developments which are important to the
structural biology community. The major facility upgrade at SSRL (bringing its performance to
the level of a 3rd generation source) is important given its positive impact on the existing stations
and user community and the clear benefits for many experiments for very high brightness beams.
Likewise, components of the NSLS Phase III upgrade will also directly benefit the structural
biology users through beamline and insertion device developments.</P>
<P>This BERAC Subcommittee concludes that full implementation of the specific
recommendations of the Birgeneau/Shen Report (i.e., funding for 1,2,2.5 and 3) is essential to
both the immediate and longer term health and growth of the field. The Subcommittee did not
discuss that part of recommendation 1 that deals with 4th generation R&amp;D since it was
outside the purview of the Subcommittee's charge. In light of the science being enabled by
synchrotron-based structural molecular biology research, we urge that DOE give consideration to
the above recommendations in setting their funding priorities for FY 1999 and beyond.</P>
<I><P>Budgetary considerations:</I> The budgetary aspects of this recommendation for DOE
synchrotrons are covered in detail in the Birgeneau/Shen BESAC report. The request for
addressing the shortfall in funding for CHESS is $0.5M/yr. Interagency cooperation on both of
these issues is urged by the Subcommittee.</P>
<B><P>V.&#9;Future research efforts: Detector, automation, and methodology
development</P>
</B><P>In order to foster continued expansion of facility access and improved capabilities at
existing and new beamlines, the Subcommittee recommends continuing research and
development of detector systems and automation. These two priority items are described
below.</P>
<I><P>Research in advanced detectors for x-radiation</P>
</I><P>One of the most critical and often rate limiting steps for utilization of the beamtime is
the detector used to collect the scattered x-radiation. While image plate detectors currently offer
sufficient definition for large unit cells, read out time is relatively slow. Charge coupled devices
(CCDs) have much faster read out times, but these times may still be limiting if the exposures are
rapid enough and do not have the resolution necessary for very large unit cells to be collected
efficiently. With the very high intensity sources from wiggler and undulator insertion devices,
current technology does not provide detectors to take maximum advantage of the potential
capabilities. Research is ongoing in a number of laboratories to develop more advanced detectors
using different methodologies, including pixel array or amorphous silicon technologies, for
example. These detectors offer improvement in the accuracy and speed of data collection, thus
increasing the efficiency of use of bright synchrotron beamlines for biological crystallography.
They offer the potential of improvements in dynamic range, data throughput, and point-spread
function, and the capability to perform time-resolved experiments at the level of a few
milliseconds. The Subcommittee felt strongly that research in this area must continue and be
fostered to produce the necessary detectors to improve the use of current beamlines and create the
ability to discover new advances in the field.</P>
<I><P>Beamline automation</P>
</I><P>The development and implementation of a robotics workstation for high-throughput data
collection of protein crystals is a very high priority in order to maximize use of valuable
synchrotron radiation beamtime. Several laboratories are developing robotics workstations for
protein purification, crystallization, and crystal analysis. The logical advancement is to develop
automated crystal mounting and alignment systems for x-ray diffraction data collection. This is
particularly important for microcrystal work where the crystals are often extremely difficult to
observe and align. One automation system currently under development is using technology
developed for the Human Genome Project. The goal is to reduce the amount of time necessary
for crystal mounting and data collection using thoroughly automated robotics workstations.
Traditionally, these steps take a significant amount of synchrotron beamtime (approximately
10-15 minutes) to go in and out of the beam "hutch" and to align the samples. As data collection
times decrease to less than an hour in several cases, this time loss becomes significant. Ideas for
future development include use of optical methods to rapidly optimize crystal centering and
development of new hutch designs to allow for simultaneous alignment/mounting of crystals in
parallel with data collection. In addition, small synchrotron beams allow selection of different
parts of the crystal for optimizing diffraction and managing crystal decay, both areas that would
benefit from automation.</P>
<P>This technology will be invaluable to the efforts in high-throughput structure analysis that
will be absolutely required in structural genomics and very high-throughput structure-based drug
design.</P>
<I><P>Methodology development</P>
</I><P>Improved methods to optimize data collection strategy (including high resolution, poorly
diffracting crystals, very large unit cells, etc.), data reduction, structure phasing/solution and
refinement (especially at very high resolution) are important components that need further
development. The current and new generation detectors are requiring new data processing
software. Seamless interface between data acquisition, reduction, and analysis utilizing local and
remote high performance computational capabilities will become increasingly important to
enhance throughput and effective use of beamtime. Interactions of the beamline groups with
researchers in their home institutions can significantly improve productivity and new tools
utilizing network-based collaboratories offer new approaches, especially as robotics and
automation become more common.</P>
<B><P>VI.&#9;New Beamlines</P>
</B><P>The Subcommittee considered the question of whether additional beamlines for
macromolecular crystallography are needed at this time.</P>
<P>New beamlines for structural biology develop through differing mechanisms: they may be
initiated by the facility in response to perceived demand or recognized opportunities, or they may
be initiated by a consortium of users (Participating Research Team [PRT] or Collaborative
Access Team [CAT]) to meet the particular needs of that group. The route taken depends largely
on the character of the individual storage-ring facility (i.e., mostly facility-administered
beamlines at CHESS and SSRL; mostly PRT/CAT-based beamlines at NSLS and APS). New
beamlines have typically exploited completely new real estate. However, as the facilities mature,
new beamlines increasingly will arise through the redeployment and refurbishment of existing
beamlines built for another purpose. Each of the US synchrotron facilities has opportunities for
expansion or redeployment, and several initiatives relevant to structural biology and to
macromolecular crystallography, in particular, have advanced to various stages of planning and
to proposals for funding.</P>
<P>A new beamline initiative may address needs at various levels. It may focus on a particular
technology (e.g., MAD phasing); it may relate to high-throughput crystallography (as for
structural genomics); it may address state-of-the-art diffraction needs for a specific consortium of
users; or it may be designed to provide expanded capacity for the community at large. Several
new beamline initiatives in structural biology have been proposed, and are seeking funding.
These include Structural Genomics - CAT, Southeast - CAT, and Northeast - CAT at APS;
portions of wiggler stations on beamline G at CHESS; and X6B and portions of an in-vacuum
undulator (X13/X9) at NSLS. In addition, the opportunity for superconducting bend magnets has
been examined and approved for crystallography at ALS; 3 are proposed with 3-4 MAD stations.
There are also possibilities for additional insertion devices at SSRL.</P>
<P>We encourage a case-by-case evaluation of beamline proposals by the funding agencies. We
advise that priority be given to innovative applications. Since there is a relatively long lead-time
from conception to operation for beamlines (three years or more), it is important to anticipate
future needs now even though several beamlines for structural biology are just now becoming
operational and plans are being made to upgrade others.</P>
