<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The goal in Essay #3 is simple<strong>:</strong> precisely what assumptions do we make within the familiar
3D Friedmann universe to get the less familiar 4D Riemannian hypersphere - what cosmologists refer to as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric - whose topological characteristics have been discussed in the two previous essays?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Many cosmologists, physicists, and mathematicians have suspected for the better part of a century that what we observe in the universe is "embedded" in higher dimensional FRW space.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>All right.   How do we translate this vague suspicion into a specific topological assumption?
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The way we'll do it is give a brief synopsis of the big bang model, presumably with conventional Friedmann space.    Then we'll show what modifications are necessary to get Riemann's 4D hypersphere, the formal name for the generic "finite but unbounded universe" referred to frequently in the popular literature.

A. The Standard Big Bang Model
 </font> <pre></pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Here is a brief summary of what we
know, or at least <em>think</em> we know, about the universe<strong>:</strong>  
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
  
  <li>Elastic space in the local vicinity is expanding according to the Hubble
parameter, H, whose most likely value is probably between 60 km/sec/mpc and
75 km/sec/mpc.   (Mpc = megaparsec or 3.26 million light years.)   The "age"
of the universe is the length of time it has been expanding, and the range
of H <em>alone</em> (without any other adjustments) implies an age for the
universe between 13 and 16 billion years.   
    <p></p>
    <li>Note the way H is defined<strong>:</strong> km/sec/mpc.   Two terms
- km and mpc - are length<strong>;</strong> they cancel each other out, with
a dimensionless constant remaining.   Thus H = constant/sec and, if we assume
H remains the same over the billions of years of expansion, the age of the
universe is simply 1/H (now expressed in seconds).   Here H indicates how
long ago any two points, now separating, were together.</li>   
      <p> 
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color=red>[This second item seems like such an innocuous statement.   Believe it or not, this negates the Friedmann models, as you will see shortly.]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>    
    <li>The Friedmann models assume that the rate of expansion is decelerating
(and how much depends on the density).   If H was higher in the past, this
implies a younger universe than the rate of expansion in the current era
would suggest (as explained above in the reduction of age in a universe with
critical density).   Then, surprisingly, in early 1998 it was announced that
the luminosity of supernovae in distant galaxies indicated that the expansion
was accelerating, not decelerating.    If H was lower in the past, then we
inhabit an older universe, but need to assume there is <em>something</em>
 - called a "cosmological constant" - which is a repulsive force that (surprisingly)
causes acceleration.   While it seems odd to have to incorporate this old
recycled idea, it does bring the age of the universe up to an appropriate
comfort level.           
      <p> </p>

    <li>Light travels at 186,000 miles/sec (or 300,000 km/sec) and is designated
by "c".  </li>

<font color="red">[OK, here are a few neat links:
<p>
<OL>
<LI><A href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni/uni_101bb2.html">Foundations of Big Bang Cosmology</A> is one of the better sites explaining the current model.  And it has a good introduction to the various types of matter which I discuss at the start of Essay #4. 
<p>
<li>I also recommend (again) <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/%7Ewright/cosmolog.htm">Ned Wright's site</a>.   In the News section - as of February 2002 - he has several articles about MAP (Multiple Anisotropy Probe) and if you scroll down a little further you'll see the chart he has on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anistropy.   The first (highest) peak occurs right where the theorists expected it to occur, but perhaps a little higher than anticipated.   The slight discrepancy leads some theorists (next item) to suspect we better consider a maginally closed universe, just to be on the safe side. 
<p>
<li>Here is <A href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...545....1W&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e125574">the abstract</A> in which the authors express some reservations concerning conventional conclusions about automatically accepting a "flat" universe.   Shortly you'll find out how to get a "no-doubt-about-it" closed universe" by using nothing more than a very simple argument in geometry.   In other words, it's possible to define the singularity in such a way that the universe starts off as a "closed cosmic hypersphere" (of the Riemannian variety) and <em>stays</em> that way.
<p>
<LI>
<A href="App9.html">Appendix 9</a> has another link to a Javascript at Ned Wright's site which calculates the age of the universe based on Hubble's constant, the density parameter, and the cosmological constant.   Links to several abstracts indicate what researchers believe
is the most likely range of these three critical variables, which seem to provide solid evidence favoring either a flat universe or one that might be just <em>barely</em> closed.   As mentioned
in the middle of the short file, the Javascript can also be used to determine
the red shift of the minimum in size and luminosity referred to<a href="perceptions(2).html#minimum">in Essay #2</a>.]
<p>
<li><a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/13/11/8">Quintessence</A> appeared in the November 2000 issue of Physics World and was written by Robert R. Caldwell and Paul J. Steinhardt.   This is a fine "survey" articles and tells why the assumption these days is a universe with about one-third dark matter and two-thirds dark energy.   The text near Figure 3 suggests a no-doubt-about-it flat universe, but later data suggests there might be a <em>little</em> doubt.   (See 3 above.)    

<p>
<li><A href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0308/p25s02-stss.html">The Dark Side of the Universe</a> is an article in the March 8, 2002 Christian Science Monitor written by Michelle Thaller.   It puts the latest results of the microwave background analysis in good perspective.   If there's any hubris these days, it comes in knowing <em>for sure</em> that we don't know very much <em>at all</em>.   With at least 90% of "all there is" in a form that we can only make vague inferences about, it will be less of a surprise if the universe turns out to be radically different from what was assumed ("standard cosmology") throughout most of the twentieth century.

    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Since the universe is expanding
and light travels at a finite velocity, we actually look back in time, into
a significantly smaller universe that has not had as much time to expand
as it has in the current era.   If the red shift z of a receding object occurs
in a spherical universe, the relative size of the universe in that earlier
epoch, compared to its size where we are, is 1/(1 + z).
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But the universe cannot appear
to shrink in size indefinitely<strong>:</strong> the theoretical limit of this shrinkage is a collapsed dimensionless "singularity" which we look toward in all directions and which
seems to be about 13 to 14 billion light years away, depending on H and how
it changes.   The singularity has an infinite red shift and so the universe
must have zero size according to the 1/(1 + z) ratio. 
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If H = constant through all time,
the distance to the singularity is c/H and the lookback time is 1/H seconds.   But remember that these values change if H changes<strong>;</strong> if the universe is accelerating and H is increasing over time, both the distance and lookback time to the singularity also increase, as does the age of the universe (as shown by using higher values for <font face="symbol">W</font><sub>vac</sub> in Ned Wright's Javascript). 
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The next step is to show how a universe with these widely accepted
characteristics can be transformed into Riemann's "closed cosmic hypersphere".

B. Setting the Stage: A Flat V<sup>2</sup> Surface versus a Curved
S<sup>2</sup> Surface</font>
   </font> </p>
    <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To begin, let's imagine that we occupy an elastic surface whose rate
of expansion is expressed by the Hubble parameter H.   For example, if we
assume a Hubble parameter of 65 km/sec/mpc and that this expansion rate remains
unchanged over time, then a little number crunching shows that the "age"
of the surface is about 15 billion years, because that is the length of time
it has been expanding from the original or "pre-expansion" state.   (This
simple derivation of the "age" based on a constant rate of expansion could
adjusted up or down depending on whether the expansion is accelerating or
decelerating, respectively.) </p>
   
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Using H = 65 km/sec/mpc, consider these three additional assumptions
about the surface: </p>
 </strong></p>
 <blockquote>
    <p>  </p>
    <ol>
         
      <li>There is virtually no physical clue in the local vicinity indicating
that the surface has any curvature whatsoever, though it really is a positively
curved spherical surface which we naturally assume is flat.</li>
 
      <p>      </p>
      <li>Light is restricted to and travels along the surface at a velocity
of 186,000 miles  per second or 300,000 km/sec. </li>
 
      <p>      </p>
      <li>We know we're looking toward the collapsed dimensionless site about
 15 billion light years away.   By formal definition of the Hubble parameter
the  entire elastic structure - whatever its geometry turns out to be - resides
at this  collapsed site.   We'll assume it has zero dimensions and that this
collapsed  site is receding at the speed of light, duplicating a condition
that happens  with the singularity in the physical universe. 
        <p></p>
        <p>  </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
 </blockquote>
    <blockquote><font color="red"> [Incidentally, I realize that we can't
see quite all the way back in time to the collapsed receding t = 0 site -
that is, the singularity - in the physical universe.   Some of the reasons
are: (1) we can't see anything receding at the speed of light and (2) the
very early universe is opaque to light transmission.   Nevertheless I believe
that it's possible to make reasonable deductions about the nature of an elastically
expanding structure by assuming that we can see all the way to the collapsed
receding t = 0 position, at least in theory.   We know for sure there is
a t = 0 position; we also know for sure that we can't ever physically "see"
it, except in our imagination.   So in the following discussion <em>some</em>
 precision in the "real world" is being sacrificed for the sake of a mathematical
ideal.   If this <em>is</em> a sin, I hope it's a venial sin, not a mortal
one.] </font></blockquote>
 
      <p></p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Even though the specifications given for the surface seem too sparse to
make any practical conclusions about its global nature, the necessary and
sufficient condition which yields intrinsic positive curvature in S<sup>2</sup>
 is implicit within the information given. 
      <p></p>
   
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To demonstrate how, let's pick <em>any</em> position on this surface and  consider it to be our location, A.   Then pick <em>any</em> other position on  the surface and call it B.    (Since we're not putting any restrictions
other  than it be a <em>different</em> position of the surface, point B stands
generically  for <em>all</em> other positions.)   </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>We look <em>toward</em> B and, in fact, we look <em>beyond</em>
 B (along a continuation of the same geodesic), all the way back in time
to the collapsed position 15 billion light years away.   Again, by definition
the entire structure (including both points A and B) when time t &gt; 0 resides
at the collapsed position receding at the speed of light 15 billion light
years away when t = 0. </p>
 
      <blockquote><font color="red"> [Note that I'm assuming something rather
simple, but unorthodox<strong>:</strong> that we can can keep looking "round
and round" the sphere - always back in time along an increasingly smaller
surface - inevitably toward the central location at which both the S<sup>

the same instant, about 15 billion years ago.   If you don't know what S<sup>2</sup> and V<sup>3</sup> stand for topologically, check out the table at the start <A HREF="hierarchy(1).html#table">of Essay #1</A>.] </font></blockquote>
 
        <p></p>
  
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Since we're looking back in time, we could say that the Hubble
parameter assumes a negative value because everything is now <em>approaching</em>
 the collapsed  position.   We would just reverse the sign: -65 km/sec/mpc.
        </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Now here is where we start to run into a problem if we assume
the surface  is "flat" and is expanding (or contracting) in <em>only</em>
 (x,y,t) dimensions. </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It's reasonable to assume that our light path along this surface
and all  positions (when t &gt; 0) should reach the collapsed position at
virtually the same instant, when t = 0, because they both exist on the same
surface.   The curiosity is that we're looking toward the collapsed position
        <em>faster</em> than we're assuming any other position is approaching
it, provided we stick to our guns and maintain the global contraction of
the surface is described properly by -65 km/sec/mpc as we look back in time
and that whatever object we observe is "embedded" on this surface (with an
"embedded" object meaning here that the <em>only</em> movement of the object
is confined to the global movement of the surface). </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Keeping in mind that we observe point B receding at subluminal
velocity at some earlier time when t &gt; 0, consider these questions<strong>
:</strong>  </p>
        <p> </p>
        <ol>
 
          <li>Exactly <em>how</em> can we observe point B when t &gt; 0,
obviously look "beyond" it at the speed of light, and then also have point
B be defined to exist at the still further collapsed site when t = 0 (where
all loci automatically exist)? 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>When time is reversed, does point B approach the collapsed
position <em>along</em> our line of sight so that it reaches the collapsed
site at virtually the same instant our line of sight does? </li>
        </ol>
   
        <p></p>
  
        <p>
Can this problem be solved easily by assuming we occupy a supposedly
"flat" plane that exists in <em>only</em> (x,y,t) dimensions?   If it can't,
what modification of the original assumption provides the <em>simplest</em>
 solution to this problem? </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Well we could resolve this apparent paradox by assuming we occupy
an elastically expanding  spherical surface whose global behavior is described
by (x,y,<strong>z</strong>,t) - and  <strong>not</strong> a plane described
by (x,y,t).   In either instance, we look toward  the collapsed site because
this inferred position is <em>always</em> a characteristic of any elastic
structure whose expansion is formally described by the Hubble parameter. 
      </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The advantage of the spherical surface is that we know that all
light  paths ("geodesics") and all surface loci (when t &gt; 0) arrive at
the collapsed  site when t = 0, but by <em>different</em> routes.   Our line
of sight is confined  to the positively curved surface (called "S<sup>2</sup>
" in <a href="hierarchy(1).html">in Essay #1</a> while the global movement
of any locus relative to the collapsed  receding site occurs only along the
radius (at right angles to the surface,  in "V<sup>3</sup>" also defined
in Essay #1). </p>
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Both S<sup>2</sup> and V<sup>3</sup> - representing the "surface"
and "interior" of the sphere - collapse to zero size at virtually the same
instant, when t = 0 at the collapsed receding site.   And this also explains
how we could be looking toward the collapsed site  <em>faster</em> than we're
assuming any other position approaches it, because our geodesics traveling
at the speed of light are confined to the "surface" (circumference) and the
slower global subluminal expansion or contraction is restricted to the "interior"
(radius). </p>
      
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If we were on such a surface and couldn't decide whether it was
flat (x,y,t)  or curved (x,y,z,t), I believe even a skeptic would concede
that it's <em>possible</em> to  define the collapsed site in a way that gives
us a positively curved spherical surface (that we're looking around at least
once).</p>
 
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>How? </p>
 
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>By assuming that all loci when t &gt; 0 also exist at the
collapsed site when t = 0, which we always look toward at the speed of light
in <em> any</em> elastic structure whose rate of expansion is described by
the Hubble parameter.   The loci when t &gt; 0 obviously reach the collapsed
receding position when t = 0, but probably <em>not</em> along our positively
curved line of sight on the surface in S<sup>2</sup>, rather via a shorter
hidden radius in V<sup>3</sup>, along a spatial dimension not noticed by
the "surface inhabitants".  </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>This line of reasoning transforms what seems at first glance to
be a flat plane in V<sup>2</sup> into a positively curved - or, if you will,
a "finite but unbounded" - spherical surface in S<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Now let's look briefly at what's happening in the universe<strong>...</strong> 
       
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>We are inhabitants of elastic space that <em>seems</em> to be
expanding within the interior of a "flat" Euclidean sphere in (x,y,z,t) dimensions.
  But we also know that we're looking toward a collapsed singularity whose
distance is probably about 13 to 14 billion light years away. </p>
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>And we have <em>exactly</em> the same problem with <em>exactly</em>
 the same solution.  </p>
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The problem is that we're looking toward the singularity at the
speed of light, much faster than anything else is approaching it when time
is reversed.   On the other hand, it's also reasonable to assume that <em>
all</em> discrete matter and <em>all</em> geodesics arrive at the singularity
at precisely the same instant, when t = 0, because the same space in which
they both exist collapses to virtually nothing at the singularity.  </p>
   
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Does discrete matter (that is, quasars, galaxies, absorbers, black
holes,  etc.) that we see at an earlier epoch when t &gt; 0 approach the
singularity <em>along</em> our naturally occurring geodesics so that they
arrive at the same time, when t = 0? </p>
 
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote><font color="red"> [Just for the record, there are no
baryons - the building blocks of the atoms which form the more complicated

          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If we inhabit a Friedmann universe with supposedly "flat" space,
wouldn't we have to make some rather extraordinary and bizarre assumptions
in classical physics to assume that they do? </p>
   
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Again, the <em>simplest</em> solution to this problem is to
assume positively curved Riemannian space.   It's formed by projecting the
topological behavior of a spherical surface (in S<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>3</sup>
) onto the comparably curved space of a Riemannian hypersphere (in S<sup>

via the two appendices in the "Myths" section at the end <a href="hierarchy(1).html#return">

to the positively curved space in S<sup>3</sup>, while the global expansion/contraction
relative to the singularity is confined to the radius in V<sup>4</sup>. 
 Both collapse to zero size when t = 0, but the geodesics and discrete matter
necessarily reach the singularity by <em>different</em> routes. </p>

<p> [<strong>Short Editorial:</strong>
Here's a problem that I have with the conventional cosmological wisdom which
has prevailed for almost a century<strong>...</strong>This simple thought
experiment leads one to question whether Friedmann space provides the best
model of an expanding universe, as it assumes that (1) the naturally occuring "geodesics" (light paths) and (2) global expansion relative to the singularity both occur in the same
type of space (x,y,z,t), in V<sup>3</sup>. </font>
            <p> <font color="navy">But I think you've just seen a reasonable,
easily understood argument which indicates that they probably <em>don't</em>.   At the least, a first semester physics or math student could derive without difficulty this Riemannian metric in S<sup>3</sup> which obviously challenges the conventional assumption of the standard Friedmann models in V<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
Why didn't Riemann's hypersphere, the
dominant model for about a decade early in the twentieth century, continue
to "sit on the throne" once it became known that an expanding universe replaced
the static one, because the simple objection to expanding Friedmann space
given above virtually disappears if we assume expanding Riemannian space.
  Yet, for some strange reason which I've never been able to fathom, the
Friedmann models have reigned supreme ever since Edwin Hubble announced the
expansion of the universe in 1929. </font></p>
            <p> <font color="navy">But even during most of the twentieth
century when the Friedmann models were essentially unquestioned, there has
always been a lingering, almost eerie intuition suspecting "finite but unbounded"

I'm going to derive the topological condition with respect to the singularity

you've read the file to this point, my hunch is that you have a pretty good
idea of how I'm going do it).   I'll state the condition which gives us Riemannian
space and call it a "theorem" which, quite frankly, is not quite right in
official mathematical terminology.   If anything, it should be a "corollary",
and there's an argument to be made that neither is technically correct. 
 Even though the terminology is slightly erroneous, I'll stick with with
the "theorem" designation anyway.   Again, this is one of those venial sins,

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Although the cosmological community
is rather satisfied with a presumably flat Friedmann universe in V<sup>3</sup>
 and sees no compelling reason to consider an alternate model, there <em>
is</em> a way to derive Riemann's hypersphere in S<sup>3</sup>/V<sup>4</sup>
 without altering <em>any</em> of the basic assumptions of the big bang theory
(except the one that says it's Friedmann space).  
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So far we have discussed
some simple thought experiments and show how what is at first glance a flat
V-type structure can be transformed into a positively curved S-type structure.
  We'll repeat the thought process here, except this time we use simple formulas,
analyze topologically what happens at the collapsed receding position, and
then derive a simple principle which indicates what assumption is necessary
to get Riemann's 4D hypersphere.  </p>
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Suppose we have a
spherical surface (<A HREF="hierarchy(1).html#table">in S<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>3</sup></A>) defined by:  </p>
              <p>  </p>
              <center><strong>x<sup>2</sup>(t) + y<sup>2</sup>(t) + z<sup>
2</sup>(t) = r<sup>2</sup>(t).</strong></center>
  
              <p>  The t in parentheses is time, which <em>begins</em> when
the surface starts to expand and indicates that the radius (r) and the other
values (x,y,z) may change as we look or travel around the spherical surface. 
 </p>
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>We'll adopt the following
conventions/assumptions<strong>:</strong>  </p>
              <ol>
  
                <li>A position on the surface in (x,y,z,t) will be designated
a "locus" (plural<strong>:</strong> loci) whose movement is restricted exclusively
along the hidden radius, r<strong>;</strong>   
                  <p> </p>
                </li>
                <li>We will consider that we have encountered the same "locus"
by looking or traveling around the spherical surface along a route that seems
"straight" as long as the locus is on the surface and lies along the same
radius (even though r may change during the time it takes to go around the
surface)<strong>;</strong>   
                  <p> </p>
                </li>
                <li>Light is confined to the surface<strong>;</strong>  
                  <p> </p>
                </li>
                <li>The observed rate of expansion along the S<sup>2</sup>
 surface is defined by H, the Hubble parameter (and H obviously seems higher
along the multiply-connected S<sup>2</sup> surface than it is along the hidden
radius in V<sup>3</sup>)<strong>.</strong>.   We'll assume it has the same
value of 65 km/sec/mpc in the prior example and that the look back time to
the collapsed receding site is roughly 15 billion light years<strong>;</strong>
 and   
                  <p> </p>
                </li>
                <li>R &gt;&gt;&gt; 0, which means that r, the hidden radius,
is so large that it's impossible to detect the positive global curvature
in the local vicinity.  </li>
              </ol>
      
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Remember<strong>:</strong>
 as we look back in time ("round and round") along the surface, each locus, including our own,
moves toward the central location along an unsuspected radius at right angles
to the surface.   That's certainly not the impression we get because we surface
inhabitants are convinced that all loci are constrained to movement along
the two spatial dimensions we easily recognize, presumably in V<sup>2</sup>.
  </p>
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If we could see all
the way to the collapsed receding site (which we can't because it's dimensionless
and receding at the speed of light) our line of sight and all surface loci,
including our own, would arrive at this dimensionless location at the same
instant, when t = 0 some 15 billion years ago.  </p>
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Given that we know
we're going to be looking toward the collapsed site receding at the speed
of light about 15 billion light years away (regardless of what the structure
is) and that there's not the slightest clue indicating anything other than
just two orthogonal spatial dimensions apparently in V<sup>2</sup>, what
assumption would allow us to deduce that an undetected third spatial dimension
actually exists?   That the surface really has positive global curvature
in S<sup>2</sup> caused by the presence of a "hidden" third spatial dimension
in V<sup>3</sup>?  </p>
              <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If the elastic structure
is expanding according to the Hubble parameter H, the following "extra dimension
theorem" (EDT) provides the answer<strong>:</strong>  </p>
              <blockquote> <font color="#1F1FFF"> <strong>Extra Dimension Theorem:</strong>
 If all loci when t &gt; 0 in any elastic structure expanding according to
the Hubble parameter H also exist at the farther collapsed site when t =
0 at 1/H seconds ago that we necessarily look toward, then what appears at
first to be an orthogonal V<sup>n</sup> structure is actually a positively
curved S<sup>n</sup> structure with an undetected spatial dimension. </font>
 </blockquote>
<p>
No matter how many loci we look past
as we look out along the surface at the speed of light, if those loci also
exist at the collapsed receding site (which is the farthest defined position
we can look toward at 1/H seconds ago) those loci must approach the collapsed
position along a shorter route than the surface our line of sight is confined
to, along the radius of an undetected spatial dimension implicit in S<sup>n</sup>.  
                <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>What the EDT does
is <em>reverse</em> the thought process of a spherical surface, or other
comparably curved structure, that can be observed (theoretically) to collapse
to zero size. &nbsp; We know that on a spherical surface our geodesics approach
the collapsed position along the shrinking S<sup>2</sup> "surface", while
the loci approach that same dimensionless t = 0 position along an inaccessible
radius in the V<sup>3</sup> "interior". &nbsp; If the loci arrive at the
t = 0 position at the same instant our geodesics do, the most reasonable
conclusion we can make is that the loci get there along an inaccessible radius
we don't notice that lies in a spatial dimension we can't see. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <blockquote><font color="red" size="3"> [Considering that
we look <em>past</em> all loci at the speed of light - which is generally
considered nature's "speed limit" - how do these loci "catch up" if they
approach the collapsed position <em>along</em> our geodesics?   This obvious
paradox in Friedmann space is probably a cosmic example of not being able
to see the forest because of the trees<strong>...</strong>] </font></blockquote>
 
                  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The EDT tells us
in this instance that we have the option to define the collapsed receding
site in a certain way that let's us know we're on a globally curved S<sup>
2</sup> spherical surface that we're looking around at least once rather
than an orthogonally flat V<sup>2</sup> plane.   And if it's only once, then
the route toward this collapsed site has the generic character of a spiral,
that is, looking along a spherical surface which collapses to zero size when
we look around it precisely one time.</p>
                  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>An intriguing
deduction of the EDT is that looking toward the collapsed receding site is
equivalent to looking toward our "back side", the proper description of encountering
our locus again along a route that seems "straight", even if our locus is
defined to exist at this site with all other loci.   </p>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The way to get
Riemann's hypersphere and an  "uncompactified" fourth spatial dimension is
simply to reapply the EDT and assume that all loci when t &gt; 0 in the observable
universe also exist at the singularity when t = 0, at the beginning of time.
  To reiterate<strong>:</strong> any two loci don't separate until t &gt;
0<strong>;</strong> at t = 0 those two loci are always together, as mentioned
in the second item <a href="#A">of Section A</a> above.  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <blockquote><font color="red"> [This line of reasoning
in topology implies that a fourth spatial dimension, suggested by both Riemann
and Kaluza, is actually implicit in the Hubble parameter.   We always look
toward the singularity at the receding t = 0 position which necessarily includes
all loci until t &gt; 0, thus leading us to conclude (via the EDT) that a
fourth spatial dimension exists in the "uncompactified" mode of S<sup>3</sup>
/V<sup>4</sup>.   This argument shows that what we see in the universe is obviously "embedded" in higher dimensional space, and it's been that way all along.  It's an elegantly simple argument that makes you wonder why Riemann's hypersphere fell by the wayside in the 1930s.]

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Assuming that
we look around a Riemannian hypersphere just once as we look toward the singularity,
this path has the same characteristic spiral route referred to on the spherical
surface, because whatever happens in S<sup>2</sup> also happens in S<sup>

the multiply-connected S<sup>3</sup> surface than it is along the hidden
radius in V<sup>4</sup>, for the same reason given earlier.   Likewise, in
this scenario looking toward the singularity is equivalent to looking toward
our "back side", because that's what happens on the embedded spherical surface
in S<sup>2</sup>.      </p>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Although a V<sup>
