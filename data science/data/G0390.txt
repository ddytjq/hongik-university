<A NAME="CP">
<H1>Homogeneity and Isotropy</H1>
</A>

<P>
The Cosmological Principle:
</P>
<H2>
The Universe is Homogeneous and Isotropic
</H2>

<P>
To say the Universe is homogeneous means that any measurable
property of the Universe is the same everywhere.  This is only
approximately true, but it appears to be an excellent approximation
when one averages over large regions.  Since the age of the
Universe is one of the measurable quantities, the homogeneity
of the Universe must be defined on a surface of constant proper
time since the Big Bang.  Time dilation causes the proper time measured 
by an observer to depend on the velocity of the observer, so we
specify that the time variable t in the Hubble law is the
proper time since the Big Bang <EM>for comoving observers</EM>.
</P>

<A NAME="MD">
<H2>Many Distances</H2>
</A>

<P>
With the correct interpretation of the variables, the Hubble law 
(<EM>v = HD</EM>) is 
true for all values of D, even very large ones which give v &gt; c.
But one must be careful in interpreting the distance and velocity.
The distance in the Hubble law must be defined so that if A and B
are two distant galaxies seen by us in the same direction, and A and B 
are not too far from each other, then the difference in distances from
us, D(A)-D(B), is the distance A would measure to B.  But this
measurement must be made "now" -- so A must measure the distance to B
at the same proper time since the Big Bang as we see now.  
Thus to determine D for a distant galaxy Z we would 
find a chain of galaxies ABC...XYZ
along the path to Z, with each element of the chain close to its neighbors,
and then have each galaxy in the chain measure the distance to the next
galaxy at time t<SUB>o</SUB> since the Big Bang.
The distance to Z, D(us to Z), is the sum of all these subintervals:
<PRE>
D(us to Z) = D(us to A) + D(A to B) + ... D(X to Y) + D(Y to Z)
</PRE>
And the velocity in the Hubble law is just the change of D per unit time.
It is close to <A HREF="./doppler.htm"><EM>cz</EM></A>
for small <A HREF="./doppler.htm">redshifts</A> but deviates for large ones.
The <A HREF="./st_diags.htm">space-time diagram</A> below repeats
the example from <A HREF="./cosmo_01.htm">Part 1</A> showing how a change in
point-of-view from observer A to observer B leaves the linear velocity
<EM>vs.</EM> distance Hubble law unchanged:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./linear_wlc.gif" WIDTH=555 HEIGHT=165 ALT="linear v-vs-D
space-time with lightcones" VSPACE=10>
</CENTER><BR>
but not showing the lightcones.  Note how the lightcones must tip over
along with the worldlines of the galaxies, showing that in these cosmological
variables the speed of light is c <EM>with respect to local comoving
observers.</EM>
</P>

<A NAME="DH">
<P>
The time and distance used in the Hubble law are not the same as the
x and t used in special relativity, and this often leads to confusion.
In particular, galaxies that are far enough away from us necessarily
have velocities greater than the speed of light:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./linear_wide.gif" WIDTH=597 HEIGHT=19 ALT="wide view" VSPACE=5>
</CENTER>
The light cones for distant galaxies in the diagram above are tipped over
past the vertical, indicating <EM>v &gt; c</EM>.
The <A HREF="./st_diags.htm">space-time diagram</A> below shows
a "zero" (really very low) density cosmological model plotted using
the D and t of the Hubble law.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./omega0.gif" WIDTH=637 HEIGHT=433 ALT="Omega=0 space-time">
</CENTER><BR>
Worldlines of comoving observers are
plotted and decorated with small, schematic lightcones.  The red
pear-shaped object is our past light cone.  Notice that the red curve
always has the same slope as the little light cones.
In these variables, velocities greater than c are certainly possible,
and since the open Universes are spatially infinite, they are actually
required.  But there is no contradiction with the special relativistic
principle that objects do not travel faster than the speed of light,
because if we plot exactly the same space-time in the special relativistic
x and t coordinates we get:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./omega0sr.gif" WIDTH=633 HEIGHT=437
ALT="Omega=0 model in SR coordinates">
</CENTER><BR>
The grey hyperbolae show the surfaces of constant proper time since the
Big Bang.  When we flatten these out to make the previous space-time
diagram, the worldlines of the galaxies get flatter and giving
velocities v = dD/dt that are greater than c.  But in special
relativistic coordinates the velocities are less than c.
We also see that our past light cone crosses the worldline of the
most distant galaxies at a special relativistic distance 
x = c*t<SUB>o</SUB>/2.
But the Hubble law distance D, which is <EM>measured now,</EM> of these most 
distant galaxies is <EM>infinity</EM> (in this model).
Furthermore, this galaxy with infinite Hubble law distance and hence infinite 
Hubble law velocity is visible to us, since in this model the observable
Universe is the entire Universe.
The relationships between the Hubble law distance and velocity (D &amp; v)
and the redshift z are given below:
<PRE>
v = H<SUB>o</SUB>D
D = (c/H<SUB>o</SUB>)ln(1+z)
1+z = exp(v/c)
</PRE>
Note that the redshift-velocity law is <EM>not</EM> the special relativistic
Doppler shift law 
<PRE>
1+z = sqrt((1+v/c)/(1-v/c))
</PRE>
which only applies to special relativistic coordinates, not to 
cosmological coordinates.

<A NAME="DA">
<P>
While the Hubble law distance is in principle measurable, the need for
helpers all along the chain of galaxies out to a distant galaxy makes
its use quite impractical.  Other distances can be defined and measured
more easily.  One is the <EM>angular size distance</EM>, defined by
<PRE>
theta = size/D<SUB>A</SUB>    so   D<SUB>A</SUB> = size/theta
</PRE>
where "size" is the transverse extent of an object and "theta" is
the angle (in radians) that it subtends on the sky.
For the zero density model, the special relativistic x is equal to
the angular size distance, x = D<SUB>A</SUB>.
</P>

<A NAME="DL">
<P>
Another important distance indicator is the flux received from an
object, and this defines the <EM>luminosity distance</EM> 
D<SUB>L</SUB> through
<PRE>
Flux = Luminosity/(4*pi*D<SUB>L</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>)
</PRE>
<A NAME="DT">
A fourth distance is based on the light travel time: 
c*(t<SUB>o</SUB>-t<SUB>em</SUB>).
People who say that the greatest distance we can see is c*t<SUB>o</SUB> are
using this distance.
But c*(t<SUB>o</SUB>-t<SUB>em</SUB>)
is not a very useful distance because it is very 
hard to determine t<SUB>em</SUB>,
the age of the Universe at the time of emission of the light we see.
And finally, the <EM>redshift</EM> is a very important distance
indicator, since astronomers can measure it easily, while the size or
luminosity needed to compute D<SUB>A</SUB> or D<SUB>L</SUB>
are always very hard to
determine.  The redshift is such a useful distance indicator that it is
a shame that science journalists conspire to leave it out of stories:
<A NAME="5WNOZ">
they must be taught the "5 w's but no z" rule in journalism school.
</P>

<P>
The predicted curve relating one distance indicator to another depends
on the cosmological model.  The plot of redshift vs distance for Type Ia
supernovae shown earlier is really a plot of cz vs D<SUB>L</SUB>,
since fluxes
were used to determine the distances of the supernovae.  
This data clearly rules out models that do not give a linear 
cz vs D<SUB>L</SUB>
relation for small cz.
Extension of
these observations to more
<A HREF="http://www-supernova.lbl.gov/public/">distant supernovae</A>
have started allow us to measure the 
<A HREF="./sne_cosmology.html">curvature of the cz 
vs D<SUB>L</SUB> relation</A>, and provide more valuable
information about the Universe.
</P>

<P>
The perfect fit of the CMB to a 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#BB">blackbody</A> allows us to determine the
D<SUB>A</SUB> vs D<SUB>L</SUB> relation.  
Since the CMB is produced at great distance but still looks like a
blackbody, a distant blackbody must look like a blackbody (even though
the temperature will change due to the redshift).
The luminosity of blackbody is
<PRE>
L = 4*pi*R<SUP>2</SUP>*sigma*T<SUB>em</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
where R is the radius, T<SUB>em</SUB> 
is the temperature of the emitting blackbody,
and sigma is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant.
If seen at a redshift z, the observed temperature will be
<PRE>
T<SUB>obs</SUB> = T<SUB>em</SUB>/(1+z)
</PRE>
and the flux will be
<PRE>
F = theta<SUP>2</SUP>*sigma*T<SUB>obs</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
where the angular radius is related to the physical radius by
<PRE>
theta = R/D<SUB>A</SUB>
</PRE>
Combining these equations gives
<PRE>
D<SUB>L</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> = L/(4*pi*F)
    = (4*pi*R<SUP>2</SUP>*sigma*T<SUB>em</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>)/(4*pi*theta<SUP>2</SUP>*sigma*T<SUB>obs</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>)
    = D<SUB>A</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>*(1+z)<SUP>4</SUP>
      or
 D<SUB>L</SUB> = D<SUB>A</SUB>*(1+z)<SUP>2</SUP>
</PRE>
Models that do not predict this relationship between D<SUB>A</SUB> 
and D<SUB>L</SUB>, such
as the <A HREF="./segal_errors.html">chronometric model</A> or the
<A HREF="./tiredlit.htm">tired light model</A>, are ruled out by the
properties of the CMB.
</P>

<P>
Here is a 
<A HREF="./CosmoCalc.html">Javascript calculator</A> that takes 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#H0">H<SUB>o</SUB></A>, 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#Omega">Omega<SUB>M</SUB></A>,
the normalized 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#CC">cosmological constant <EM>lambda</EM></A>
and the redshift <A HREF="./glossary.html#redshift">z</A> 
and then computes all of the these distances.
</P>

<A NAME = "SF">
<H2>Scale Factor a(t)</H2>
</A>

<P>
Because the velocity or dD/dt is strictly proportional to D, the
distance between any pair of comoving objects
grows by a factor (1+H*dt) during a time interval dt.
This means we can write the distance to any comoving observer as
<PRE>
D<SUB>G</SUB>(t) = a(t)*D<SUB>G</SUB>(t<SUB>o</SUB>)
</PRE>
where D<SUB>G</SUB>(t<SUB>o</SUB>) 
is the distance to galaxy G <EM>now</EM>, while
a(t) is universal scale factor that applies to all comoving objects.
From its definition we see that a(t<SUB>o</SUB>) = 1.
</P>

<P>
We can compute the dynamics of the Universe by considering an object
with distance D(t) = a(t) D<SUB>o</SUB>.  This distance and the corresponding
velocity dD/dt are measured with respect to us at the center of the
coordinate system.  The gravitational acceleration due to the spherical
ball of matter with radius D(t) is g = -G*M/D(t)<SUP>2</SUP> where the mass
is M = 4*pi*D(t)<SUP>3</SUP>*rho(t)/3.  Rho(t) is the density of matter which
depends only on the time since the Universe is homogeneous.  The mass
contained within D(t) is independent of the time since the interior
matter has slower expansion velocity while the exterior matter has
higher expansion velocity and thus stays outside.  The gravitational
effect of the external matter vanishes: the gravitational acceleration
inside a spherical shell is zero, and all the matter in the Universe
with distance from us greater than D(t) can be represented as union of
spherical shells.  With a constant mass interior to D(t) producing the
acceleration of the edge, the problem reduces to the problem of a
body moving radially in the gravitational field of a point mass.
If the velocity is less than the escape velocity, the expansion
will stop and recollapse.  If the velocity equals the 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#Vesc">escape velocity</A>
we have the critical case.  This gives
<PRE>
v = H*D = v(esc) = sqrt(2*G*M/D)
    H<SUP>2</SUP>*D<SUP>2</SUP> = 2*(4*pi/3)*rho*D<SUP>2</SUP>  or

rho(crit) = 3*H<SUP>2</SUP>/(8*pi*G)
</PRE>
For rho less than or equal to the 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#CD">critical density</A> rho(crit), 
the Universe expands forever,
while for rho greater than rho(crit), the Universe will eventually
stop expanding and recollapse.  The value of rho(crit) for 
H<SUB>o</SUB> = 65 km/sec/Mpc is 8E-30 = 8*10<SUP>-30</SUP> gm/cc
or 5 protons per cubic meter
or 1.2E11 = 1.2*10<SUP>11</SUP> solar masses per cubic 
Megaparsec.  The latter can be
compared to the observed
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0012085">
1.75E8 = 1.75*10<SUP>8</SUP></A>
solar luminosities per Mpc<SUP>3</SUP>, requiring a mass-to-light ratio
of 700 in solar units to close the Universe.
If the density is anywhere close to critical most of the matter
must be too dark to be observed.
Current <A HREF="./density.html">density estimates</A> suggest that
the density is between 0.3 to 1 times the critical density, and this
does require that most of the matter in the Universe is dark.
