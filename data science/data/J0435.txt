      <H2>Part I of Aaron's 1997 LeMans trip</H2>

      <P><B>From: <A HREF="mailto:aaron@heimke.com">Aaron Heimke</A>
<BR>
      To: Travels with TrackSchedule.com - http://www.trackschedule.com</B></P>

      <P>Coco has asked me to tell about <B><FONT SIZE="+1">my 1997
      LeMans trip</FONT></B>. I will do it in serial fashion, with
      no particular logic about when the breaks come. Ready? Here we
      goooo...... <BR>
      </P>

      <P><I>BACKGROUND:</I> I had heard the best way to go to your
      first LeMans was to go with an old vet. I knew the perfect person!
      He was (and is) old, he was a vet (Zoomie C130 pilot from way
      back), and even better, he had been to numerous LeMans race.
      I am referring to Jerry Pearce (cc'd above), who for many years
      served tirelessly as President of PCA Germany. He has lived in
      Germany since retiring from active duty in the Air Force. I had
      met him down in my litte corner of Germany, but home for him,
      his wife, his dog, his 89 Carrera, his 944 cab, and his speed
      yellow Ford Ranger is in Wiesbaden, near Frankfurt. The Ford
      was really cool. It even had a RUF engine in it! (Once or twice,
      whenever he had to take one down to Pffafenhausen, that is.)
<BR>
      </P>

      <P>Anyway, the planets were aligning, and it looked like I would
      be able to go. I planned on just hitching myself to Jerry's experienced
      wagon. The budget way to go was to do the camping thing. No problemo,
      plenty of experience with that. I loaded up my tent, etc into
      the BMW and headed to Wiesbaden. This would be the staging area
      for our assault. I left my house around noon, thundered up to
      Jerry's and linked up with him. German beer began to flow as
      we assembled the team. Riding with me in the BMW would be Mike,
      an Air Force jet mechanic. His beater 944 was not up to the trip.
      Riding with Jerry was Peter, a German member of PCA who owned
      a very nice 944. As Prez, Jerry had to haul a good bit of stuff
      for the annual PCA-LeMans blowout picnic to France. That meant
      the Ford. Not a bad deal, because that gave him a dry place to
      sleep once everything was unloaded. We had a nice dinner near
      Jerry's house and settled in for a good night's sleep - Long
      trip tomorrow.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>Thursday - Up and on the road early. There is no convenient
      autobahn from Wiesbaden to Saarbrucken (Our crossing point into
      France) so we took nice country roads through Germany's wine
      country. Before crossing we &quot;wedgie-packed&quot; the cars
      full of cheap coupon gasoline. (US Forces in Germany can buy
      gas coupons on post that are used to get gasoline at close to
      US prices. They are no good in France, so we would have to pay
      euro-price there - $4/gallon.) We headed West.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>We used the autoroute for a little while. They are toll roads,
      and speed limit is 120 kph. Jerry knew a more direct cross country
      route. No tolls, and we could mostly cruise at 120kph. Since
      the direct route was shorter, traffic was light, and the roads
      mostly straight, progress was very good. Jerry and Peter have
      a tradition of stopping at a little village restaurant call &quot;La
      Forge&quot; when travelling to and from LeMans. None of us had
      any Frence, and the family that owns and operates La Forge had
      no English or German skills. We ordered by making the sound of
      the animal we wanted to eat: &quot;MOOO&quot; got you a nice
      little steak, and &quot;BAAA&quot; produced a lamb chop. Very
      effecient. This little restaurant probably hasn't changed one
      bit in 150 years. We had a great lunch and headed west, getting
      back on the autoroute about 100 miles on down the road.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>We skirted Paris. In the suburbs, it looks very American,
      with strip malls, car dealers, and big &quot;WalMart&quot; type
      places along the autoroute. We kept moving, finally arriving
      at the track. <BR>
      </P>

      <P>By earlier arrangement, some old freinds of Jerry's from the
      Porsche Club of Great Britain were going to share their camping
      spot with us. They came early in the week, towing a camping trailer.
      The spot was big enough for the trailer and 4 or 5 tents. The
      campground is about 1/2 mile behind the main grandstands, on
      the other side of the small racetrack that is used for club events.
      In years past, they were apparently pretty casual at this campground,
      letting cars come and go without much control. For '97, things
      tightened up. There was a maximum of 2 cars per camping spot,
      and they were guarding the gates. You had to show a sticker to
      get in, and it was suppossed to be actually stuck to the windshield.
      We used American ingenuity and deviousness to overcome the Gallic
      hassle. One car after another was driven through with the sticker
      wedged just right under the windshield. The sticker was then
      pocketed and carried out to the next car. We got all cars in
      and parked, and began setup.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>We were at LeMans!! Race cars could be heard doing practice
      laps as we set up or tents. Once we were established, we headed
      over to the track to watch practice. <BR>
      </P>

      <P><B>I will finish for today, and pick up Part II from Thursday
      afternoon....</B></P>
