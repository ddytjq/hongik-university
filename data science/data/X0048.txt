      <h2>Equipment and Rule Changes Cause Injuries<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>by Jeremy Clayton / Calgary &lt;<a href="mailto:jeremycl@telusplanet.net">
jeremycl@telusplanet.net</a>
&gt;</h3>
Possibly the most common and most dangerous hockey injuries these days are
head injuries, particularly concussions.<br>
      <br>
Few people know that before players started wearing helmets concussions were
almost unheard of and unknown in hockey. So why and how could a device that
is supposed to protect players' heads actually be contributing to head injury?
Simple: head hits.<br>
      <br>
Before helmets arrived, a head hit was a very rare event except in fights.
Now they are very common. Players seem to think it's OK to hit a guy in the
head if he's wearing a helmet. Before the age of helmets a head hit would
have precipitated a full-scale brawl. Nowadays they're common. And a head
hit into the glass or boards is also common. In the old days if a player
had done that, they wouldn't have left the rink alive.<br>
      <br>
Another factor is that equipment is being used as a weapon instead of its
real purpose, which is to protect the individual player. Elbow pads and shoulder
pads were once made from leather, which is fairly soft. Now they're made
from plastic, which is very hard. A head hit from a plastic elbow pad or
shoulder pad will definitely hurt--I guarantee it.<br>
      <br>
A third factor is that sticks are now being made from metal alloys or hard
plastics. Prior to this they were all wood. Wood is hard, of course, but
these other substances are harder still. That's why some defencemen like
them.<br>
      <br>
A fourth factor is the instigator rule, which means that any player who starts
a fight gets kicked out the game. This rule was brought in to cater to the
sensibilities of American hockey fans, who (quite frankly) don't understand
hockey and view fighting as a barbarism. Hockey fighting had a very real
and necessary place in the game: If some goon or moron hit Mario Lemieux
or Wayne Gretzky, the team's enforcer would be sent out to do something about
it--i.e, police the situation and protect the stars.<br>
      <br>
This system was simple and it worked. But as soon as the instigator rule
was brought in, teams could no longer protect their stars. In fact, Lemieux
and Gretzky complained about this rule for years. But everybody just thought
they were whining. You could also ask Forsberg of Colorado, who was so beaten
up that he took a whole season off this year (2001-02) to recuperate. (He
came back to star in the playoffs). I guarantee that if the instigator rule
weren't in existence, he would have been a lot healthier. The star players
are basically being left to their own devices, to defend themselves. This
is much to the detriment of the game.<br>
      <br>
If you combine these factors with the fact that players are bigger and faster
these days, it all adds up to a lethal combination that results in lots of
injuries--and many more head injuries in particular.<br>
      <br>
I was checking the NHL player injury lists in the paper this year, and most
teams had a least one player with a concussion or head injury on their injury
list. Some had as many as three or four. The Calgary Flames had one defenceman
out for the whole season with a concussion. And we've seen players forced
to retire due to incurring so many concussions--notably Brett Lindros. He
will probably soon be followed by his brother, Eric, who has sustained several
concussions, including at least one this year.<br>
      <br>
If hockey fans really want to tackle the injury problem, they should start
lobbying the NHL (which influences everybody) right away to have plastic
equipment modified or eliminated: elbow pads and shoulder pads for starters.
I know Don Cherry has spoken out on at least two occasions on Hockey Night
in Canada about the plastic elbow pads. I don't believe the average person
is aware of how lethal this equipment is. So at the very least, a campaign
about this would raise awareness.<br>
      <br>
Jeremy Clayton / Calgary<br>
      <br>
P.S. Just a couple of added thoughts on fighting.<br>
      <br>
I am not supporting fighting, but...<br>
      <br>
I played hockey for many years and never fought once. Most players don't
fight. In other words, the average player doesn't really want fighting either.
But if the league and the refs don't protect the skill players against the
idiots and goons, they have to defend themselves or have someone stand up
for them. The instigator rule has made it impossible for the teams to police
the goons and goofs who attack the skill players and stars.<br>
      <br>
I know that a lot of people would like to see fighting completely eliminated.
I would too (from all sports), if they could come up with a better system.
The instigator rule is not the solution.<br>
      <br>
Fact: Although an occasional player may get cut in a fight, it is very rare
for a player to actually get hurt or injured.<br>
      <br>
Fact: Although outsiders think otherwise, hockey fans do not believe fighting
is an integral "part of the game" and do not go to hockey games just to watch
fights. After watching (or playing) a good hockey game, I've never heard
anyway say the game was diminished or would have been better if there had
been some fighting. I don't even notice if there were fights or not. Nor
have I ever heard anyone say that a poor game would have been better if there
had been some fights. If it was a lousy game, it was a lousy game.<br>
      <br>
Fact: much hockey fighting could be eliminated if the NHL simply increased
the size of the rinks to European dimensions. This would create more room.
Hockey players have become bigger, faster and more mobile in the modern era,
and there simply isn't as much room out there as there used to be, which
leads to more contact and fights.<br>
      <br>
Increased rink size would also bring in a greater accent on skill, team play,
skating and passing. Puck handling and puck movement would become much more
important, as it is in European hockey. And star players would also have
more room to move and display their talents.<br>
      <br>
Unfortunately, this will never happen. Why? Because it would invite more
Europeans into the NHL. (Some fans think that there are already too many
Europeans in the NHL.) And expanding rink size would also be expensive, though
it could be done progressively over a five-or ten-year period.<br>
      <br>
The NHL is still toying around with the idea of removing the red line. This
will certainly help somewhat by opening up the ice and eliminating the terrible
and boring "trap" system of checking which most teams now employ. It would
also cut down on the clutching, grabbing and hooking that lead to a lot of
fights.<br>
      <br>
Fact: A lot of the hockey fighting has been cleaned up over the years. You
very rarely see the big brawls (and never see the bench clearing brawls that
used to exist) that we now often see in baseball and basketball.<br>
      <br>
All in all, I have mixed feelings about the whole thing, but anything that
leads to fewer injuries is OK with me.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial" color="#003333">My interest in ice hockey has 
been life long. I am 45 years old and grew up playing hockey from as early 
as I can remember on the frigid outdoor rinks and frozen ponds of Northern 
Ontario, where -30&ordm; F was not uncommon. Hockey was one of the few forms
of entertainment in the winter and part of the very fabric of society growing
up.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#003333">I still play old timers hockey. 
It is a wonderful sport to play if safe, but unfortunately it is probably 
the most dangerous sport you can play. You are three times more likely to
end up in a wheelchair as a quadriplegic or paraplegic than a football player.
And you are constantly facing the risk of concussion by your head hitting
the Plexiglas, the boards, or the ice.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#003333">Why is it so dangerous? Because 
you are on a 1/8 inch piece of steel on hard ice and are surrounded by boards
and glass that don't move in a collision. Add to this hitting (at least in
men's hockey), and the sport as it is now played is a disaster waiting to
happen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#003333">The only people to benefit from
this setup are the professional team owners and players at the highest level
where violence is used to sell tickets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#003333">Hockey is a crap shoot. Each year
there will always be a few players who will end up permanently disabled by
paralysis, concussion, or blindness. That's why I do not want my two sons
playing the game.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#003333"><b><u><font face="Arial">But we could make
this a truly fantastic sport by simply making a few changes</font></u></b></font>
 </p>
      <ol>
 <li> <font color="#003333"><b><font face="Arial">Replace the current boards 
with boards that don't cause paralysis.</font></b>&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li> <font color="#003333"><b><font face="Arial">Replace the current Plexiglas 
with material that doesn't cause concussions.</font></b>&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li> <font color="#003333"><b><font face="Arial">Remove all hitting from
the game.</font></b>&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li> <font color="#003333"><b><font face="Arial">Remove all fighting from
the game.</font></b>&nbsp;</font></li>
 
      </ol>
 <font face="Arial" color="#003333">All it takes would be a few rinks set
up with these basic rules. Then parents could see hockey played for the pure
sport of the game, without the attendant risks and dangers we see today.
Hopefully, with rinks operated under these rules we could create a groundswell
among parents to demand a sport that is both safe and fun for kids.</font><br>

 </h3>
            <h2><b><font size="+2">Rough play on ice</font></b> </h2>
While the jury is very much out on the question of checking in hockey (editorial,
March 10, 2000), there is near unanimous agreement that the sport in general
has become too violent. I don't care what the NHL chooses to do. Those guys
get paid big bucks to bash each other around. If the NHL wants to become
the WWF on ice (except with real blood and sticks, not the fake chairs and
props), then so be it. <br>
            <br>
What happens to our youth, however, is another matter. As a hockey parent 
I have an intimate knowledge of the sport firsthand. Fortunately, most of
our games this past year were well played and officiated. But there were
those few games, those few referees, those few teams, the combination of
which created a very dangerous situation. The referees would not call penalties
and the rough play would escalate--by our team as well as the opponents. <br>
            <br>
Suffice it to say that by midseason I had grown tired and frustrated of seeing
nice kids being forced out of games--in some cases bleeding, in other cases
dazed--because of illegal hits. That's really crazy, especially for 11- and
12-year-olds! <br>
            <br>
Hockey is a great sport. I'm just afraid that if we don't do something about
the violence and the increasing possibility of injury, it will soon be relegated
to the same category as ancient Roman gladiatorial combat.&nbsp;</td>

hit" is glorified in professional ice hockey. But body checking is unnecessary
for the quality of the game and demonstrably dangerous for most amateur players
at the youth, high school, and college levels. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">Ice hockey is a collision sport, but
the intensity of body contact delivered and permitted has escalated beyond
the margin of safety. Violent body collisions in professional ice hockey
relate more to the entertainment value of the event than the true beauty
of the sport, but, unfortunately, the style of play at all age levels is
influenced by the professional leagues. Too often, the major swings in the
flow of the game caused by the "big hit" may be due to player injury, especially
at the youth level. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">The profile of hockey injuries has changed
over the years. In the 1970s, facial lacerations and dental injuries predominated,
and cervical-spine injuries were rare. Now, following equipment changes adding
helmets, full face shields, and heavy padding, facial and dental injuries
are almost nonexistent, but catastrophic cervical-spine injury is a fixture
of the hockey scene, and a host of other injuries--including shoulder dislocation, 
fractures, and concussion--are common. A review of the literature demonstrates 
these trends and suggests direction for the future.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <h3><font color="#330000"> Youth Injury Rates</font></h3>
 <font color="#330000"><b>Community-based studies.</b> Several colleagues
and I began to look at youth ice hockey injury during the 1989-90 season
(2). We tracked 152 boys in nine youth teams (ages 9 to 15), at three age
levels (Squirt, Peewee, and Bantam) and three ability levels (A, most skilled;
B, intermediate skilled; and C, least skilled) in a Minnesota community to
assess the rate, severity, and distribution of injuries. We defined injury
as any interruption in play. The injury rate was 15 per 100 players per season
(52 total injuries, including 8 fractures). Thirty-eight players were injured
during games as a result of body contact; 9 injuries involved legal checking,
and the remainder resulted from illegal checks or other violations. Eighty-eight 
percent of injuries involved collisions. </font>
            <p><font color="#330000">Stuart et al (3) studied the same age-groups
in a different Minnesota community at the A level of play during the 1993-94
season. The injury definition was restricted to injuries lasting more than
1 day or involving concussion, skin laceration, or dental injury (National
Athletic Injuries/Illness Reporting Systems [NAIRS] definition). The study
of 66 players showed 21 injuries per 100 players per season (14 injuries
reported), with game injury rates of 0, 0, and 10.9 injuries per 1,000 player-hours
for Squirt, Peewee, and Bantam teams, respectively. The majority of injuries
in this study were also game related. Four of the injuries were fractures;
50% involved collisions. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">We reanalyzed the data from our study
(2) using the NAIRS injury definition and the same exposure assumptions as
used by Stuart et al. The game injury rates for the Squirt A, Peewee A, and
Bantam A boys' teams were 6.7, 12.3, and 10.8 injuries per 1,000 player-hours. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">In a 1993 Finnish study of 1,437 players
aged 9 to 18, Bjorkenheim et al (4) reported 9 injuries per 100 players per
season, 9% of which sidelined athletes longer than 1 day. Ninety-four percent
of the injuries occurred during games, and 53% were due to collisions. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">To build on our data from the community-based
season studies, my colleagues and I looked at game injuries during youth
tournaments involving 807 boys in the 1993-94 season (5). Using on-site athletic
trainers to record injuries, we found that the game injury rate was four
to five times greater during tournament play than during regular-season play
at the Bantam and Peewee levels. For example, during Bantam A competition,
the tournament injury rate was 43 per 1,000 player-hours, compared with 11
per 1,000 player-hours in the two community studies (2,3). In tournaments,
collision caused 65% (39 of 60) of total injuries and 77% (20 of 26) of NAIRS-definition
injuries (5). Eleven penalties were associated with injuries; 6 were for
checking from behind. As in our initial study (2), the majority of players
returned to the same game or returned by the next day. There were no injuries
in girls' competition, where body checking is banned. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">In one survey (6), associates and I
compared injury rates during the regular-rules and "fair-play" portions of
a junior tournament. The injury rate was five times greater and the number
of penalties assessed was two times greater in the regular games than in
the fair-play games. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000"><b>College and elite amateur injuries.
            </b>Injuries in male college hockey are similar in frequency
and pattern to youth hockey. A recent 3-year study (7) of nine National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division 1 teams reported a game injury rate of 14.7
per 1,000 athlete-exposures using criteria similar to NAIRS reporting. Sixty-five
percent of the injuries involved collision, and there were 18 fractures with
a mean time lost of 22.2 days. Collision with other players, the ice, and
the boards accounted for the greatest number of days lost, and most of the
injured players missed at least 1 week of competition or practice. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">A survey (8) of injuries at the 1997
Ice Hockey World Championships defined injury as any sudden trauma during
games requiring treatment by a physician or dentist. The total injury rate
was 166 per 1,000 player-hours. The rules did not require face protection,
and when the 30 facial injuries are factored out, the adjusted injury rate
was 113 injuries per 1,000 player-hours. Thirty-one players were unable to
continue play, giving an adjusted injury rate of 48.7 per 1,000 player-hours.
The fracture rate was 9.4 per 1,000 player-hours. Through the use of videotaping,
this study also demonstrated that games in which officials enforced the rules
more rigidly had lower injury rates. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000"><b>Discussion.</b> It is apparent that
tournament and higher-level play is associated with higher injury rates.
It is also clear that in both tournament and regular-season play, collision
accounts for most injuries in all of the youth hockey studies. Most of these
result from body checking, which is more vigorous during competition than
in practice. Eliminating intentional high-energy body collision would make
the youth game safer. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">There is also evidence that better compliance
with game rules prevents injuries. Our research (and that of Tator et al,
below) has found that a high percentage of injuries are caused by rule violations
(5). We also observe that the fair-play system, in which teams are rewarded
for good behavior with points in the standings, clearly reduces injury rates
(6).&nbsp; </font></p>
            <h3><font color="#330000"> Neurologic Concerns</font></h3>
 <font color="#330000"><b>Concussion.</b> Cerebral concussion or mild brain
injury rates vary among the studies. In season-length youth hockey studies,
an early study by Sutherland (9) that included players as young as 5 recorded
0.09 concussions per 1,000 player-hours, we (2) estimated 0.75 per 1,000
player-hours, and Stuart et al (3) reported no concussions. A high school
hockey study (10) reported a rate of 10 per 100 players per season. In our
youth tournament study (5), concussion rates ranged from 10.7 to 23.1 per
1,000 player-hours. As with other injuries, most concussions are caused by
collision. </font>
            <p><font color="#330000"><b>Catastrophic injury.</b> Prior to
the use of modern protective equipment, cervical-spine injury was rare in
hockey. The work of Tator et al (11,12) documents the change in Canada. Tator's
registry (11) now has 215 cases of neck fracture and has leveled off at 15
cases per year; the majority of these injuries are caused by an illegal check
from behind (12). </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">In the United States, the data of Cantu
and Mueller (13) demonstrate a direct fatality and injury rate of 3.11 per
100,000 high school hockey players and 11.55 per 100,000 at the college level.
Most of the injuries occur when the athlete is struck from behind or falls
and hits the boards. Data for USA Hockey participants are not published. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000"><b>Discussion.</b> Because the current
helmet does not completely protect the player from minimal brain trauma,
and because data on the cognitive effects of repeated concussion continue
to accumulate (14), concussion rates are of increasing concern. Like other
injuries, concussion is caused primarily by collision, and concussion rates
appear to increase with competition level; the Stuart et al study (3) may
have missed minor concussions, which by definition resolve quickly. Concussion
rates during tournaments, in particular, are very high compared with rates
for season play. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">The need for attention to the issue
of serious injury in hockey is made evident by a comparison. In football,
widely perceived to be hazardous, the direct fatality and injury rates are
half those in hockey: 1.76 per 100,000 football players in high school and
6.96 per 100,000 in college (13). </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">From the data on mechanism of injury,
particularly for cervical-spine injury, it's also clear that it's essential
to strictly enforce the check-from-behind rule and to continue education
of players and coaches about the risk of cervical-spine fracture. Maximal
decreases in injury rates are more likely with a two-pronged approach: eliminate
checking <i>and</i> strictly enforce the rules.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <h3><font color="#330000"> Aggression, Infractions, and Injuries</font></h3>
            <font color="#330000"> Players today are more skilled, bigger,
stronger, and faster than they were a generation ago, and they are wearing
padding and other equipment that decreases the risk that an aggressive maneuver
will cause pain. (My 15-year-old patient, quoted at the beginning of this
article, states the case succinctly.) As a result, players collide with greater
force. </font>
            <p><font color="#330000">Furthermore, a vicious circle results.
Body checking leads to a relaxed attitude toward collision and thus contributes
to an increase in rule infractions (15). Since the players tolerate more
aggression and more intense collisions, the officials are forced to control
the game more loosely to keep 10 skaters on the ice.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">Although rule infractions don't necessarily
follow from body checking, it's my observation that one encourages the other.&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <h3><font color="#330000"> Time to Check Checking</font></h3>
            <font color="#330000"> The simplest solution, then, to the high
rate of injury in ice hockey is to follow the example of the women's and
girl's game and eliminate body checking, at least for the youth levels of
the sport. I'm not alone in recommending this solution: For example, in 1991,
the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine (16) recommended that intentional
body contact not be allowed except in the preinternational and preprofessional
leagues. </font>
            <p><font color="#330000">Would ice hockey suffer without checking?
The women's game is remarkably free of injury and is still exciting to watch.
In fact, many players of a generation ago bemoan the current emphasis on
the body check, remembering their own reliance on speed and puck-handling
skill. Eliminating checking would allow young players to concentrate on these
aspects of the game. The very small percentage of ice hockey players who
move to the professional level of play could certainly learn the art of body
checking in short order. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#330000">Helmets, full face shields, and maximal
padding reduce injuries in ice hockey (17,18), but safety equipment can't
yield maximum protection without effective enforcement of the rules. Furthermore,
it is unlikely that male hockey can return to stricter rule enforcement without
a strong effort by players, coaches, and referees to tone down the intensity
of the body collisions. A ban on body checking, backed by fair-play rules,
would be a major step in that direction.&nbsp; </font></p>
