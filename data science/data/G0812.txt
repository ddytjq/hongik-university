Abstract
<p>
By numerical simulations, we study the detailed processes of dynamical friction
between two elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the feedback mechanism of 
self-gravity is unimportant to predict the braking of the two objects and their
merging time. We study the deformation of the primary, by splitting up its
potential in multipoles in its center of mass frame. The phase lag between 
the quadripole and the rigid secondary is monitored, and can be interpreted in 
terms of a forced oscillator. The quadripole deformation is not sufficient 
however to account for all the friction force. We show that the octupole
deformation participate significantly to the friction, and we can reproduce
the whole phenomenon by taking into account the l=2 and l=3 terms only.
<p>
When the deformation of the secondary is taken into account, tidal forces
are so high on the small-mass companion that the merging time is considerably
reduced: up to a factor 5, for a mass ratio of 1/10.
<p>
We conclude that the dynamical friction processes between two elliptical
galaxies are global and non-local in essence, and that the Chandrasekhar 
approach does not correspond to the reality of the phenomenon.
