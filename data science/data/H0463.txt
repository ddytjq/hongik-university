In 1918, a number of American and European newspapers printed in bold black ink a drawing of a killer:  a seductively smiling skeleton swathed in black lace and named "The Spanish Lady." But this frightening agent was not actually a criminal from Spain; it was a common virus&#8212;a flu virus&#8212;sweeping the globe, so deadly its victims often succombed within a week of their first symptoms. When the pandemic finally ended, 20 million had died&#8212;more than were lost on the battlefields of World War I.

Many adults remember another more recent pandemic&#8212;the 1968 Hong Kong flu, which was less of a killer but seriously disrupted the world economy. Such scenarios remind us that influenza is a powerful adversary. And it is old; it has been making people sick at least since ancient Greek and Roman days and perhaps since people first began living in large groups. At unpredictable times, a strain within the type A class of flu viruses suddenly mutates so drastically that we have no immunity. This can ignite a pandemic, a situation more serious than an epidemic because pandemics generally cover larger geographic areas and affect an exceptionally high proportion of a population.
<p>
"Most influenza experts believe it's not a matter of if we'll have another pandemic, but when," says Nancy Cox, chief of the Influenza Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We have a large global population that is extremely mobile, so if a new strain of influenza with pandemic potential and the ability to spread from person to person does emerge, we will be in a race against time." 
<p>
Of course, a new pandemic as lethal as the one in 1918 is unlikely because we have medications to fight the secondary infections such as pneumonia, which actually cause most flu-related deaths. People in the U.S., except for the most susceptible, would probably survive. But people in less-developed countries might not be so fortunate. Even in the U.S., though, influenza is a major health threat; a normal flu year in this country can cause 10 to 40 thousand deaths and cost billions of dollars.
<p>
Fortunately, scientists are developing new weapons in the war to first understand, and then conquer this tenacious virus. The Santa Fe Institute played a part in this process, this January, by hosting a workshop sponsored by the W.M. Keck Foundation and the Joseph P. and Jeanne M. Sullivan Foundation. The workshop brought together experimentalists, who work with empirical data, and theoreticians, who develop computer models to help solve complex problems. The result was a new synergy of people who don't often cross paths and a new start to solving this challenging problem.
<p>
First, some facts about the flu: There are three main evolutionary groups of flu, types A, B, and C. Of these, the C strains do not cause major public health problems. The A and B viruses are always circulating and are responsible for annual epidemics. Within these categories, new versions of the virus are constantly appearing while others become extinct. The flu has confounded generations of scientists because of its ability to change, mutating constantly to defeat our immunities and thus survive. 
<p>
The virus can be thought of as looking like a tennis ball with spikes sticking out of it. Inside the ball are eight segmented RNA strands. The spikes are two proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Their job is to attach to cells in their host's respiratory tract, then replicate.
<p>
Scientists look most seriously at the hemagglutinin because it mutates at a very high rate, giving the virus its ability to circumvent the host's immune defenses.  Because new strains with different hemagglutinin are constantly emerging, influenza is like an army of viruses whose soldiers are constantly changing their camouflage.

Add to this another dimension&#8212;the evolution of the virus through its hosts. Any time the virus meets a new individual immune system, it can mutate. This is particularly frightening because influenza can jump from one species to another. Aquatic birds are the ultimate influenza reservoirs because the genetic material for every flu virus exists within their population. Periodically, chickens, pigs, horses, and even seals are also infected. This phenomenon acts as a huge mixing bowl, prompting more variants and greatly increasing the chance that a new strain will be produced to which humans have no immunity. It is thought, for example, that the 1918 virus began in birds, spread to pigs, and circulated among humans for several years before it abruptly mutated and became deadly.
<p>
The scientists attending the SFI workshop include an international mix of leading biologists, epidemiologists, virologists, and mathematicians. Their aim is not so much to map a battle plan against influenza, but rather to exchange ideas about new weapons in the arsenal. "Our goal is to bring together people who are looking at various dimensions of the problem so they can inform one another about what the questions and capabilities are," says Simon Levin, professor of biology at Princeton and Cornell, SFI Science Board member, and workshop organizer.
<p>
Research biologist Robin Bush works on influenza at the molecular level. She and Walter Fitch are part of a team of researchers at the University of California, Irvine, who are finding clues to one important way the virus evolves&#8212;through antigenic drift. This is the accumulation of genetic mutations, particularly in the spiked surface proteins that an influenza virus makes in order to stay ahead of our immunities. Bush and her colleagues constructed family trees for type A viral strains from 11 consecutive flu seasons with each branch representing a new mutant strain. Then they analyzed the number and type of changes in a particular part of the hemagglutinin gene. "In nine out of the eleven cases," Bush explains, "we were able to predict which current strains would be the progenitors of the next strains."
<p>
It is an exciting discovery. The studies are theoretical, but if developed, the potential for predicting the capricious ways of the virus could save lives. Scientists might be able to better forecast which strains would cause epidemics or pandemics and tailor the vaccines to be more effective. "Some of this is getting to know your foe," says Alan Perelson, leader of the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory, director of SFI's Theoretical Immunology Program, and workshop co-organizer. "If you want to come up with good treatment strategies, vaccination strategies, and planning strategies, you really have to understand the  evolution of the virus."
<p>
But how can computer modeling, which was used in the evolutionary study, help scientists who are on the front line of fighting the flu? "When we try to model this system with all these different individuals and different histories, it's immensely complicated," says Levin. The implication is that too detailed a model will produce no insights. "So how do we create reduced-dimensional descriptions that are easier to manipulate and more robust in their predictions?" he asks. "Some differences are important and some are not for understanding a particular question." 
<p>
He explains that some generalization is necessary to make models work. "Individuals need to be lumped together into groups of individuals with similar epidemiological histories and risks," he says. "Such approaches are standard in dealing with large collections of individuals. Perhaps the best example involves virtually any model to describe evolutionary change. Every individual is unique, yet if [early population geneticists] Fisher, Wright, and Haldane had stopped there, our understanding of evolution would still be in the dark ages. The tools of population genetics focus on very limited numbers of loci, lumping individuals together based on identity at those loci. This approach suppresses variation at unrelated loci, creating classes large enough that robust prediction and generalization can be made.

 "Of course, insurers also rely on their ability to create such categories as well, lumping individuals together in ways that may annoy some of those individuals, but allow robust statistical predictions to be made" he adds.
<p>
One such agent-based model has been used recently by Derek Smith in collaboration with SFI's Stephanie Forrest, Alan Perelson, and UNM computer scientist David Ackley. It explores the problem of why people who get flu shots every year sometimes get sick anyway, even when the vaccine should protect them. Smith's model showed that more of these people got the flu in years when the epidemic strain was almost identical to the previous year's. "The antibodies stimulated by the vaccine circulate for at least a year," Smith says. "If the strain in the second vaccine is very close, the old antibodies will eliminate it before new immunity can form."
<p>
It's a hypothesis, but one that is getting serious attention. Smith and others hope to test it with animal and perhaps human studies in the near future. If the experiments support the theory, the findings could dramatically improve strain selection for the vaccine. "One of the things models can do is inspire clinical trials," Levin says. "If we can get people to believe the model has some merit, then it guides the way to clinical work."
<p>
"We as modelers would like to be able to bridge the gap between the genetic data&#8212;the sequence data&#8212;and someone who needs to know how a specific mutation in the virus might affect the way the immune system sees it," Perelson says. "We can't do that now, but it's a problem we're starting to discuss." Perelson's Los Alamos colleague Catherine Macken has helped to fast-forward this type of research by establishing the Influenza Sequence Database, which incorporates all the influenza sequences in the world, plus tools for working with them, into an easily accessed website.

In February, Bette Korber, who is at SFI part time, as well as at Los Alamos National Laboratory, presented work at the 7th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Her research indicates that the HIV virus has existed in human populations for at least 70 years&#8212;far longer than most researchers had thought. <p><p>

Korber reached this conclusion by comparing the composition of the genetic material of the many current strains of the virus and extrapolating back to a common origin. The approach she employed is a well-recognized technique that has been used to determine when different species diverged from a common ancestor. Similar studies of human mitochondrial DNA have also identified a common female ancestor of modern humans, called &#8220;Eve,&#8221; who migrated out of Africa sometime between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. Some researchers are calling Korber&#8217;s species-leaping HIV a &#8220;viral Eve.&#8221;<p><p>

The finding that the virus first jumped from the chimpanzees into humans sometime around 1930 could provide epidemiologists strong hints about the future evolution of the epidemic.

During the workshop, while participants take informal breaks, discussion centers on such resources. In fact, much of the most important work happens during these breaks when scientists gather in the sunny spaces at SFI. In one group, Neil Ferguson, of Oxford, has prompted discussion with his model, which, though it's in preliminary stages, explores the seasonality of influenza. His findings show that seasons may cause it to mutate very rapidly at specific times. In temperate climates, flu epidemics hit like a wave in winter while remaining at a low ebb in warm months. Ferguson's model, which he hopes to test against epidemiological and genetic data, raises the possibility of genetic bottlenecking due to this wave effect. The findings could help researchers implement better management strategies. Elsewhere, modelers are talking to other modelers with different skills. People who try to understand influenza at its genetic level are exchanging ideas with those who focus on its global spread.
<p>
Besides influenza, other diseases such as HIV, measles, malaria, and hepatitis are being discussed because they too evolve in ways that defeat the efforts of the immune system. "This will be a continuing effort and we intend to make some comparisons across systems," Levin says. "The evolutionary tree of influenza doesn't look like other diseases. Why is the evolution of this disease different?"
<p>
Answering that question and others will be an ongoing pursuit. "You're going to see a lot of people coming back to SFI to work on these questions," says Levin. Already his group, which focuses on epidemiology, is exploring new directions with Perelson's team, which focuses on immunology. Both scientists hope the effort will eventually include the CDC experts, with whom Perelson's team already has strong interactions, the evolutionary biologists, and others. It's a promising beginning. <p>
