<P><B>Biotechnology<BR>Good Ideas Are Growing</B> 
<P>Advancements made possible by biotechnology can significantly enhance the 
quality of life in many areas. We must pursue these benefits with the most 
responsible science available. Today's research reinforces the safety of 
biotechnology products in the marketplace, but we recognize that questions are 
being raised and they must be addressed. 
<P>We also recognize that scientific understanding alone is not enough. We 
respect the fact that biotechnology also raises philosophical implications. 
These, too, must be addressed. The best way for biotechnology to fulfill its 
promise is for people to share their views, respect their differences and work 
together for future progress. 
<P>As we go forward, the Council for Biotechnology Information will work hard to 
acknowledge people's concerns, answer questions and resolve uncertainties. And 
we will continue in our commitment to responsible behavior and sound science. 
<P><B>Good Ideas Are Growing</B> 
<P>Biotechnology is becoming an important tool that can improve our quality of 
life in many ways, both now and in the future -- from life-saving medicines to 
more nutritious foods. Discoveries in biotechnology allow for some key crops to 
have their own protection against insects and disease and, therefore, they can 
be grown using less crop protection chemicals. For example, cotton and corn now 
can resist some destructive insects on their own. This allows farmers to choose 
the best combination of tools to control harmful pests and diseases. Through 
biotechnology, a beta-carotene- and iron-enriched "golden" rice is being 
developed. This may help give young children in developing countries the vitamin 
A their bodies need to help prevent serious vision problems or blindness, and 
sufficient iron to help prevent iron-deficiency anemia. Besides foods, 
biotechnology is bringing breakthroughs in health care. Since the initial 
production of human insulin to better treat diabetes, biotechnology continues to 
create more-effective drugs and vaccines. These medicines benefit hundreds of 
millions of people worldwide who suffer from devastating diseases such as heart 
disease, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and AIDS. And in the future, 
some applications of biotechnology will be used to make materials such as fibers 
for clothes from "renewable" resources like corn. Other applications will help 
reduce our dependence on oil and natural gas and could reduce water and energy 
use by as much as 50 percent. Among the many uses of biotechnology, food and 
agriculture applications are understandably of particular interest to society. 
It is important that high-quality information be available to the public to assist 
their understanding and to support effective dialogue and decision making. With 
this principle in mind, the Council for Biotechnology Information has developed 
this brochure. 
<P><B>Benefits of Food Biotechnology</B> 
<P>Biotechnology has the potential to deliver significant benefits to: 
<UL>
<LI type=1>Consumers who seek better quality, better tasting and more nutritious 
foods. 
<LI type=1>Farmers who want more efficient methods to grow crops with less 
impact on the environment. 
<LI type=1>Developing countries seeking solutions to help feed a growing 
population. </LI></UL>
<P><B>What Is Food Biotechnology? </B>
<P>Food biotechnology covers diverse activities -- from the use of yeast in 
brewing or bread-making to advanced plant-breeding techniques. New developments 
in biotechnology allow us to identify and transfer the specific gene that 
creates a desired trait in a plant and offer a more precise way to produce 
plants with certain beneficial characteristics -- such as greater nutrition. 
<P><B>Benefits for the Environment</B> 
<P>Farmers look for ways to protect their crops from disease, weeds and insects 
that are safe to use and better for the environment. Many modern farmers use a 
combination of methods that might include crop protection chemicals, beneficial 
insects, insect resistant plants and more-efficient farming practices. These are 
the principles of Integrated Crop Management (ICM), which are being increasingly 
adopted by farmers worldwide. Biotechnology helps make choices possible and can 
provide significant environmental benefits that:<BR>
<UL>
<LI type=1>In some cases, reduce the use of crop protection chemicals, as plants 
have the ability to protect themselves. Some plants -- including corn, potato and 
cotton -- produce a protein that helps control the larvae of certain harmful 
insects feeding on the plant. 
<LI type=1>Provide opportunities to decrease soil erosion and greenhouse gas 
emissions through farming practices that protect the environment. Some of these 
new crops require less tilling, helping to preserve precious topsoil and reduce 
farm runoff into streams and rivers. 
<LI type=1>May one day produce plants that grow under tough conditions. 
Biotechnology will help make possible plants that grow and produce food in 
extreme heat, dry or poor soil, areas of flood and other conditions, and on land 
once considered difficult for farming. 
<LI type=1>May provide new sources of energy or ways to reduce pollution. 
Biotechnology may one day produce plants that make us less dependent on 
nonrenewable resources such as oil and natural gas. </LI></UL>
<P>These benefits help make agriculture more sustainable. Sustainable 
agriculture consists of practices that are environmentally sound, socially 
responsible and economically viable. This approach contributes to maintaining 
the quality of life for future generations. 
<P><I>"Biotechnology techniques have the potential to be useful in enhancing the 
quality, nutritional value, and variety of food available for human consumption 
and in increasing the efficiency of food production, food processing, food 
distribution and waste management."</I> - The American Dietetic Association 
<P><B>Nutrition, Quality and Taste Benefits</B> 
<P>The list of foods enhanced by biotechnology is growing. One of the first 
plant biotechnology products slowed down the softening process -- enabling 
tomatoes to stay on the vine longer and develop their full flavor instead of 
being picked green like most tomatoes. 
<P>Today, research into numerous other improved food products includes: 
<UL>
<LI type=1>Food crops with higher levels of nutrients that may help reduce the 
risk of heart disease and certain cancers. 
<LI type=1>Potatoes with a higher starch content, reducing the amount of oil 
absorbed during frying -- resulting in lighter and healthier french fries and 
potato chips. 
<LI type=1>Healthier cooking oils -- soybean oil with reduced saturated fat. 
<LI type=1>Cereals and corn with improved protein quality. 
<LI type=1>Higher-quality potatoes with fewer dark spots. </LI></UL>
<P><I>"Responsible biotechnology is not the enemy; starvation is. Without 
adequate food supplies at affordable prices, we cannot expect world health or 
peace."</I> - Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States 
<P><B>Benefits for a Growing Population</B> 
<P>The world's population will likely increase to approximately 9 billion by 
2050. The simple fact is that with more people, we will need to provide more 
food. At the same time, there is little remaining land for farming, without 
destroying valuable rainforest and wetland habitats. World hunger is a complex 
issue that biotechnology alone cannot solve. However, it helps. Thanks to 
developments in food biotechnology, we'll not only be able to grow more food but 
also better food on land already being farmed. 
<UL>
<LI type=1>The use of biotechnology will provide new ways for farmers to reap 
more bountiful harvests from existing land, while also sustaining this land's 
ability to support continued farming. 
<LI type=1>Plant diseases can take a devastating toll on food crops in many 
parts of the world. Biotechnology will arm vital crops such as sweet potato, 
cassava, papaya, rice and corn with defenses against viruses. 
<LI type=1>Insects damage crops in the field and during storage and 
transportation. Crops with added protection from biotechnology can reduce this 
damage, improving availability and quality. 
<LI type=1>Biotechnology is helping to create rice that contains both 
beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A, and a healthy amount of iron. This 
product can offer a tremendous opportunity to reduce the risk of childhood 
blindness -- a serious problem in developing countries -- and helps prevent 
iron-deficiency anemia. 
<LI type=1>Biotechnology can also help increase a crop's ability to withstand 
natural environmental factors, such as heat and drought, soil toxicity, and 
floods -- improving farming in regions in which food is difficult to grow. 
</LI></UL>
<P><I>"There is no doubt that biotechnology will be an indispensable tool as we 
try to serve global agricultural demand in a sustainable manner. With more and 
more people to feed ... more and more fiber to produce ... and a limited amount of 
arable land to put into production ... we need biotechnology."</I> - Dan 
Glickman, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture 
<P><B>Benefits for Agriculture</B> 
<P>Biotechnology can assist in the efficient production of more -- and more 
nutritious -- foods in ways that will lessen the impact on the environment. In 
this way, it helps farmers grow more food and better quality crops. 
<UL>
<LI type=1>Farmers can potentially produce more per acre with some biotech crops 
than with non-biotechnology crops, which helps conserve land and water. Farms 
large and small can realize these efficiency benefits. 
<LI type=1>Biotechnology reduces the time it takes for plant breeders to develop 
the plants farmers need to grow better crops. 
<LI type=1>Herbicide tolerant soybeans, the first large-scale product produced 
using modern biotechnology, helps farmers to improve yield and simplify weed 
control. 
<LI type=1>Corn that protects itself against insects also provides safer feed 
for farm animals because of a reduction of plant diseases that are often 
associated with insect damage. 
<LI type=1>Biotechnology can provide opportunities to decrease soil erosion and 
greenhouse gas emissions through farming practices that protect the environment. 
Some of these new crops require less tilling, helping to preserve precious 
topsoil, use less fuel and reduce farm runoff into streams and rivers. 
<LI type=1>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has said that 
"new technologies -- such as biotechnologies -- offer a responsible way to enhance 
agricultural productivity today and in the future." </LI></UL>
<P>Biotechnology has just begun to be used in agriculture and food production. 
But it holds real promise for improving the food we eat in ways that benefit 
both farmers and consumers. 
<P><I>"In Canada, we're taking a balanced approach to biotechnology: We're 
supporting the health, economic, and environmental benefits that we know will 
result from its use; particularly in medicine and food; while at the same 
time, stringently regulating the approval of new products to mitigate any 
risks."</I> - Lyle Vanclief, Canadian Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
<P><B>Assuring Safety of Food Biotechnology</B> 
<P>Rigorous testing and government review are in place to ensure the safety of 
these products so that we can realize the benefits of biotechnology. In fact, 
biotech varieties are tested more thoroughly than conventional crops before they 
ever come to market. In the United States, three government agencies -- the 
Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- work together to ensure that crops produced 
through biotechnology are safe. In Canada, safety of foods produced through 
biotechnology is assessed by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency. 
<P>In 1992, the FDA issued a policy concluding that foods derived from 
biotechnology, as a class, should be regulated the same as any other foods 
entering the market. The FDA evaluates food biotechnology products on a 
case-by-case basis. These products are judged on their individual safety and 
nutrition -- not the methods used to produce them. 
<P>The same labeling laws that apply to all other foods and food ingredients 
apply to products of food biotechnology. FDA requires labeling if a food has 
significant changes in nutritional content, has an allergen or otherwise has 
changes in the composition or safety of the food. 
<P>The use of food biotechnology has been supported by major health 
organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American 
Dietetic Association. 
<P><I>"As we have evaluated the results of the seeds or crops created using 
biotechnology techniques, we have seen no evidence that the bioengineered foods 
now on the market pose any human health concerns or that they are in any way 
less safe than crops produced through traditional breeding."</I> - Dr. Jane 
Henney, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
