<p> "The little satellite that could" was as international
as its name suggests, involving NASA, ESA, and the
UK Science and Engineering Research Council (now PPARC, for
acronym aficionados). It was launched on Jan 26 1978 for a 3-5 year
mission, and just kept going and going past gyroscope failures
and onboard crises. IUE was finally turned off, while still
functional but going downhill, on 30 Sept 1996. It carried a 45-cm
telescope (which looks awfully small in the replica at
the GSFC visitor center), feeding high- and low-dispersion
spectrographs for the 1150-3300 Angstrom range. Two TV detectors
with UV converters could be used with each, for short- and longer-wavelength
UV radiation. The picture shows the fixed but multi-angle solar
arrays used to reduce moving parts (which also explains why,
horror of horrors, the telescope was focussed using heaters
on the primary mirror). IUE was in a geosynchronous (but inclined
and elliptical, therefore not geostationary) orbit, so that
it could be continuously controlled from GSFC, and most of the
time from the ESA tracking station at Villafranca, Spain, from
which 1/3 of operational shifts were normally run.
At mission's end, IUE had taken
104,470 spectra of 9600 objects, from the planets to high-redshift
quasars.</p>

<a href="iueacqx.jpg"><img src="iueacqxs.jpg" hieght=152 width=214
alt="IUE acquisition of NGC 828" align=right></a> IUE introduced 
a generation of astronomers to space instrumentation
and operations, in a relatively gentle way because the real-time
24-hour operations of IUE felt not unlike traditional ground-based
observing. Target acquisitions used a photomultiplier scanning the
field of biew, giving a (slow) picture of the field of view to be sure 
you pointed IUE at the right place. The data from IUE made the importance of data archives
in astrophysics clear, and was probably the first archive to reach 
such a level that reuse of old data was generating more papers and
results than the satellite itself was in the mission's later years.
In both operational and archiving aspects, the IUE experience
echoed through the checkout and data-handling plans adopted
for HST.
</p>

<p> Some of the memorable science contributions from IUE included
tracing the velocity and occurrence of strong stellar winds,
an important factor in how massive stars evolve; showing that
the old stellar populations in elliptical include an important
role for surprisingly hot stars; and a crucial role in mapping
the surroundings of Seyfert nuclei and quasars through intensive 
and uninterrupted spectroscopic campaigns to tell which spectral lines responded
when to changes in the central source.
</p>

<p>I was involved in four programs with IUE, starting when it was only 
four years into the mission (I gather than IUE badge number 1015
was sort of a badge of honor later on when the numbers passed 2000).
With Bob Goodrich, I looked at UV spectra of some galactic nuclei
that showed evidence of weak quasar-like activity, putative missing
links between ordinary and active galaxies. Of three we looked
at, one showed evidence of an appropriate UV source of nonstellar 
radiation, one showed hot stars, and one had enough dust not to be
detected at all. And that's more or less how the statistics have
continued into the HST era, though the spectra that it can deliver are
dramaticaly more enlightening these days. At about the same time, I used
IUE to study a star-forming region in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 5430, that
was known to be extrardinarily rich in Wolf-Rayet stars. These stars
mark a short-lived phase in the lives of massive stars, when their winds
are so powerful that they shape the stars' spectra. This knot turned
out to outshine the whole surrounding galaxy in the UV, and be remarkably
free of dust. It must be a brief, and perhaps recurring, event, whose
location at one end of the galaxy's bar suggests how the gas was
collected to produce these stars so quickly.</p>

<p> Rogier Windhorst and I spent several IUE observing seasons looking
at nearby radio galaxies, as points of comparison for the objects that
were then being found at high redshifts. The points here were that
optical observations at high redshift show us the radiation that was
emitted in the UV, and that the fainter distant radio galaxies were
more likely to correspond to nearby objects than the extremely rare
powerful radio galaxies. We were able to show that many of them
have Lyman alpha in emission, like their higher-redshift cousins,
and that they practically all have stellar populations with hot
components like many bright and metal-rich elliptical galaxies.</p>

<p> In IUE's final years, I observed several galaxy nuclei which showed evidence
of simultaneously hosting a central "monster", perhaps a massive black hole, 
and a burst of star formation, whose existence might be related.
This was done with the remote-observing setup, allowing me to send
a student to my intro class one day to announce that Dr. Keel would
be there as soon as he finished pointing a satellite. The most
interesting result from these observations was in combination
with some <a href="lapalma.html">INT</a> and <a href="kpno.html">KPNO</a> 
spectra, from which I could show that the tiny nucleus of 
<a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/ngc4569.html">NGC 4569</a> 
not only underwent a starburst in the past, but that the visible light
is dominated by A-type supergiants and only fairly deep in the ultraviolet
do we see the typical population of young stars. Only thing I can
think of is that the burst was remarkably quick and we're seeing it
in a transient phase.</p>
