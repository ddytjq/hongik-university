        reduction of the mortality and morbidity caused by communicable diseases and malnutrition
        has changed the disease spectrum of different countries.&nbsp; As a result, certain
        diseases such as congenital and hereditary ones have been recognized as being major health
        burdens.&nbsp; The birth incidence of infants with congenital disorders, including those
        that are trivial or relatively easily corrected, is generally estimated to be about
        25-60/1000.&nbsp; The incidence of severe congenital disorders that can cause early death
        or life-long chronic disease, ranges from about 14/1000 in most of the more developed
        countries to about 43/1000 in some less developed parts of the world.&nbsp; In general,
        the burden of genetic disorders is heaviest in developing countries because they lack a
        social support system.<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        genetic services are relatively inexpensive in view of the great social and financial
        burden of the chronic disease avoided.&nbsp; It appears that genetic approaches are set to
        become an integral part of many aspects of medical practice, and it is important for
        health workers to have a basic understanding of medical genetics.&nbsp; There is therefore
        a need for international collaboration in improving genetic health education at all levels

        of major health importance. Taking into account that rapid advances in genetic technology
        and human genome research make it almost certain that genetic approaches become more and
        more important for health improvement, the WHO Human Genetics Programme (HGN) has been
        supporting international activities on the development of medical genetics services,
        developing genetic approaches for the prevention and control of common hereditary diseases

        example, the haemoglobin disorders (thalassaemias and sickle cell disorder - SCD) are so
        common that they provide a convenient model for working out an approach to control chronic
        childhood diseases in developing countries.&nbsp; Approximately 5% of the world population
        carry a haemoglobinopathy gene. Each year about 300,000 infants are born with major
        haemoglobin disorders.&nbsp; Nearly 70% of SCD occurs in sub-Saharan Africa where up to 2%
        of all children are born with SCD.&nbsp; Increasing global migration has introduced the
        haemoglobinopathies into many areas where they were not originally endemic.&nbsp; In the
        USA, 10% of the population is at risk for SCD, and in north-west Europe between 2 and 9%
        of most populations now belong to ethnic minorities at risk for the haemoglobinopathies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, the Western Pacific), showing successful
        management of the problem.&nbsp; In the case of thalassaemia, practically no new births of
        thalassaemic children now occur in Cyprus or Sardinia. Appropriate thalassaemia control
        programmes are now being developed in Brazil, China, Greece, India, Italy, Myanmar,
        Pakistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, UK.&nbsp; Feasibility studies on thalassaemia control
        now exist in Bahrain, Egypt, The Islamic Republic of Iran, the Maldives and Saudi Arabia.

        cases of cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, neurofibromatosis, haemochromatosis, are also
        considered by HGN. In the first instance, they are the most prevalent hereditary diseases.
        &nbsp; Secondly, the genes responsible for the disorders have now been revealed. &nbsp;
        Thirdly, approaches are available for integrated care, including testing for carriers,
        presymptomatic and early diagnosis, therapy rehabilitation, and prevention by means of
        family planning.&nbsp; It is now increasingly clear that these diseases are common enough
        with a worldwide occurrence, and that they may be misdiagnosed or overlooked unless the
        community, and in particular the medical profession, pays adequate attention to the

        order to assist countries in their efforts to apply modern techniques for the control of
        genetic diseases, HGN supports and organizes training courses devoted to the principles of
        the organization of community control programmes and methods of diagnostic procedures
        along with practical demonstrations.<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        covers different subjects in response to various generic questions which face WHO for
        direction and support.&nbsp; However, HGN has limited staff and a minimal budget for
        managing genetic problems of major health importance which require attention. &nbsp;
        Regular budget funds available to HGN only support a main nucleus of activities. &nbsp;
        Thanks to cooperation with various nongovernmental and international organizations (e.g.,
        the Thalassaemia International Federation, the International Cystic Fibrosis
        (Mucoviscidosis) Association, the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring
        Systems, the World Federation of Hemophilia, the Fondation IPSEN, the International
        Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, the International Neurofibromatosis and
        Haemochromatosis Associations, NIH) and their financial support, a number of international
        projects were further developed and joint meetings on generic problems were held. About 20
        WHO Collaborating Centres carry out a tremendous workload in different part of the world
        under the direction of HGN.<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        WHO Scientific Group on the Control of Hereditary Diseases strongly recommended the
        further development of genetic approaches to the control of various diseases and for
        health improvement.&nbsp; The preparation and international dissemination of information
        on genetic problems and possible strategies for disease control is an essential component
        of HGN.&nbsp; Such information is updated and revised at the regularly organized WHO
        meetings in the light of research developments and experience of ongoing national
        programmes.<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        trends in genetic approaches to disease control are strongly linked with the progress of
        &nbsp; international human genome research.&nbsp; Genetic technology may soon be
        applicable for identifying people with genetic risk factors for common diseases, and it is
        necessary to learn more about the social implications of this form of genetic testing.
        &nbsp; One of the ways to avoid the misuse of information is to convene discussions at
        different levels (health care professionals, policy-­makers, mass-media, schools, etc.)
        in order to establish a firm understanding of actual and potential applications of new
        genetic technology.<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        will therefore pay increased attention to bioethical and social aspects of modern genetic
        technology, supporting inter-cluster initiative on ELSI in genetics; to further
        development of community genetic services in developing countries; and to the training of
        specialists from these countries.&nbsp; HGN will continue to support national and
        international activities for the control of widespread genetic diseases, in collaboration
        with the WHO Regional Offices&nbsp; and nongovernmental organizations.<o:p></o:p></span></td>
