<p><hr><p>
<b><a name="objectives">Instructional Objectives:</a></b>
<blockquote>
<p> Students will -
<ol>
<li>discuss the feasibility of intelligent life in the universe and
propose methods of communication;

<li>design a model community for space travelers and describe how the
essential needs of the planetary biospherians will be met.</ol></blockquote>

<p><hr><p>
<b><a name="background">Background Information:</a></b>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that human beings have dreamed and wondered about the existence
of extraterrestrial life capable of communicating with us.  In the last
50 years, with the help of radio telescopes, we now have the capability
of interplanetary communications.

<p>Equally fascinating is the idea of space travel to communities on
planets and moons in our solar system or even in far-reaching galaxies
beyond our Milky Way.  Dr. William A. Gaubatz from McDonnell Douglas
Aerospace has presented the vision that perhaps "Space is a Place." 
Space is a place to travel, work, play, manufacture goods, or even mine
raw materials and convert them to energy. What would life be like if we
actually had a Delta Clipper space transportation system that could
carry people to interplanetary destinations?  How long will it be until
we have a future that includes solar farms on the moon? Orbiting talk
shows? Space adventure tourism? Or pioneers homesteading in space?  This
is a vision that believes in space as a place to be explored, a new
frontier to learn about and enjoy, and an opportunity perhaps to meet
and study other life-forms.</blockquote>

<b><a name="procedures">Procedures:</a></b>
<blockquote>

<p><u>Part A:  What Would It Be Like If We Could Communicate with
Other Life Forms?</u>

<p>Time Needed for Activity:
<br>One half of a class period

<p>Target Grade Level: 
<br>High School with minimal adjustments for middle
level students.

<p>Materials:
<ul>
<li>Internet access in the classroom (optional)
<li>Paper and pencil
<li>Art supplies (if needed)
<li>Student science journals</ul>
<p>
Activity: 
<ol>
<li>Discuss with students what they know about the existence of life
elsewhere in the universe based on literature, TV, movies, and so on. 

<p><li>Determine how many in the class "believe" that extraterrestrials
have visited our planet.

<p><li>Have the students record in their journals how scientists would
solve the problem of finding out if life exists.  Remember, this process
includes asking these questions: 

<ul>
<li>What do scientists know? -- evidence
<li>How do we know it? -- experiments and technology
<li>What don't we know?-- limits of the data
<li>What predictions can we make?  what testing can we do 
<li>What questions can we ask, what experiments can we do, to find 				
out? -- new investigations or missions</ul>
 
	
<p><li>If possible, have the students find out more about SETI on the
Internet and record their notes in their science journals.

<p><li>Have students complete the following task and then share their
results with the class.</ol>

<p>The SETI radio telescopes have picked up several unusual radio
transmissions from deep space.  The analysis of the signals support the
conclusion that the transmissions originated from intelligent life in a
distant solar system.  You would like to establish communication with
this life-form, and you must decide both the message you will send and
the kind of communication you will use (digital, music, language, etc.). 
Defend your choice.

<p><u>Part B.  What Would It Be Like If We Could Live on a Different
Planet or Moon in Our Solar System?</u>

<p>Time Needed for Activity: 
<br>One week of 50-minute classes, or if time is
given for homework, one period to introduce the project and begin in
class and one period at the completion of the assignment for in-class
presentations of the group models.

<p>Target Grade Level:  
<br>High School (Middle school students can complete
this project but are not expected to have the detailed background
knowledge presented in biology and environmental science courses.)

<p>Materials:  

<p>Each group of four students will need the following: 
<ul>
<li>Student journal for notetaking and preparing written explanations
<li>Butcher paper or poster board for illustrated models
<li>Art supplies as needed (scissors, markers, glue, colored paper, etc.)
<li>Video of Biosphere II (optional)
<li>Overhead transparencies and markers for student presentations</ul>

<p>Activity:  
<ol>
<li>Where would you like to live in the solar system if you could choose
any place in space? Have each student group select a planet or moon in
our solar system to be the site of its H.O.M.E. (Habitats Out of
Manmade Ecosystems.)  The group must gather information about the
geology, climate, atmosphere, gravity, and access to solar radiation of
their selected location.

<p><li>Because they will be the first to colonize the planet/moon, student
teams should brainstorm what supplies they will need to carry with them
from Earth -- the essentials for life.  

<p>(Optional) It would be helpful to show one of the many videos produced about Biosphere II and what
research was completed to set up the self-contained habitat.

<p><li>They may select the number of homesteaders who will travel with
them and what skills each person will have.

<p><li>Design a blueprint of the habitat on the poster or butcher paper and
include the following components: energy sources, essentials for life,
waste treatment, transportation, communication, and matter cycles.
Remind students that their biohabitat must be an all-inclusive
environment that supplies water, food and fiber, land, minerals,
technology, shelter, and a diverse gene bank of plants and animals.  If
resources are available on the planet or moon, then methods to extract
them must be included.  Microorganisms and medicinal plants should also
be considered.</ol>

<p>Assessment/Evaluation:  
<p>Each group will need to make a five-minute presentation of their
H.O.M.E. During the presentations, each student in-class will evaluate the group
presentations and provide positive feedback and constructive suggestions
for ways to improve the project.  Questions and answers should be
allowed at the end of each presentation.  At the conclusion of all the
presentations, have each group conduct an evaluation of the project and
the work of each team member.  Did all students contribute?   Did each
individual complete his or her section of the project?  Did everyone in the
group contribute to the presentation?</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<b><a name="extensions">Extensions:</a></b>
<ul>
<li>Middle school -- Have middle level
students construct a model of their H.O.M.E. rather than prepare a
blueprint.  Invite any type of presentation of their project from a
skit, short video, overhead projection diagrams, to whatever is most
appropriate.</ul>
