The Proton-Proton Chain</a></u></font>
<p>
The <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/ppchain.html">
Proton-Proton Chain</a> is the principal set of reactions for solar-type
stars to transform hydrogen to helium:<p>
<ul>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>1</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H --> <sup>2</sup>H + e<sup>+</sup> + neutrino
</font>
Two protons (<i>p<sup>+</sup></i>) react to form <i>Deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H
= 1p<sup>+</sup> &amp; 1 n)</i> plus a positron (<i>e<sup>+</sup></i>) and a 
neutrino.  In the highly ionized 
stellar interior the positron will quickly "annihilate" with an electron
(<i>e<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> --> 2 gamma-rays</i>); the gamma-rays will 
be absorbed and re-emitted by the dense matter in the stellar interior, 
gradually diffusing outward and being "degraded" into photons of lower energy.
When the gamma-ray energy reaches the photosphere each gamma-ray will have 
been transformed into about 200,000 visible photons.  The neutrino, which 
only interacts through the Weak Force streams straight out of the sun.
<p>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>2</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H --> <sup>3</sup>He + gamma-ray</font>

The Deuterium reacts with another proton to form <i><sup>3</sup>He 
(2p<sup>+</sup> &amp; 1n)</i> plus another gamma-ray.  The first two 
reactions must happen twice to form two <i><sup>3</sup>He</i> nuclei.
<p>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>3</sup>He + <sup>3</sup>He --> <sup>4</sup>He + 2 <sup>1</sup>H
</font>
The two <i><sup>3</sup>He</i> nuclei react to form <i><sup>4</sup>He
(2p<sup>+</sup> &amp; 2n)</i> giving two protons "change" plus a bit of 
added kinetic of the product nuclei.  Not that the <i><sup>3</sup>He</i> 
nuclei repel each other more strongly because they contain two positively 
charged protons.  The initial reaction above can occur at temperatures as 
low as 1 million K, but the last reaction can only occur at temperatures 
greater than about 10 million K.
</ul>
<p>
The individual nuclear reactions proceed rather slowly, and it is a very small 
fraction of nuclei in the core of the sun with enough energy to overcome the 
electrical repulsion.  Even so, every second the sun turns 600 million tons of 
hydrogen into 596 million tons of helium (with 4 million tons transformed
into luminous eneryy via <i>E=mc<sup>2</sup></i>).
<p>
More massive stars burn hydrogen via a catalytic reaction called
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/cno.html"> 
The CNO CYCLE</a>.  Because the initial step in the CNO Cycle requires a 
Carbon nucleus (<i>6 p<sup>+</sup></i>) to react with a proton it requires 
higher temperatures and is much more temperature sensitive than the
P-P Chain (The energy produced is proportional to <i>T<sup>20</sup></i>
for the CNO cycle <i>vs</i>  <i>T<sup>4</sup></i> for the P-P Chain).
Stars of mass greater than about 
1.2 M<sub><sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub></sub> with core 
temperatures,
<i> T<sub>core</sub> > 17 million K</i>, produce most of their energy 
by the <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/cno-pp.html"> 
CNO cycle</a>. 
<p>
<a name="3-alpha"><font size=+2 color="burgundy"><u>
The Triple-Alpha Process</u></font></a>
<p>
The <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/triplealph.html">
Triple-Alpha Process</a> follows hydrogen burning in both solar-type stars 
and high-mass stars transforming Helium into Carbon. (<i>n.b.</i> Stars with
M < 0.4 M<sub><sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub></sub> will 
not reach high enough temperatures for the 3-alpha process.)  There are no 
stable isotopes with Atomic Mass 5 or 8 (<i>i.e.</i> such that reactions 
like:
<ul><i>
<li> <sup>4</sup>He + <sup>1</sup>H --> <sup>5</sup>X
<li> <sup>4</sup>He + <sup>4</sup>He --> <sup>8</sup>X
</ul></i>

may occur).  The next stage in energy generation in stars is the Triple-Alpha 
Process which requires 3 - alpha particles (<i><sup>4</sup>He</i> nuclei) to
collide simultaneously to form Carbon:
<ul>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>4</sup>He + <sup>4</sup>He + <sup>4</sup>He --> <sup>12</sup>C
</font></ul><p>

This reaction requires both very high temperatures (T > 100 million K) and
very high densities which will occur only after the star has exhausted its
store of hydrogen and has a core of nearly pure helium.  Only stars with
masses greater than about 0.4M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif">
</sub> will reach temperatures high
enough to ignite the Triple-alpha process.  <p> 

<a name="adv_nukes"><font size=+2 color="burgundy"><u>
Advanced Nuclear Burning Stages</u></font></a>
<p>
Following the Triple-alpha process there are a variety of reactions which 
may occur depending on the mass of the star.  Three general principles 
influence the roles that these nuclear burning stages may play:

<ol>

<li>Successive nuclear burning stages, involving more massive nuclei with
higher charges, will require increasingly high temperatures to overcome the
increased electrical repulsion.

<li>The amount of energy released by each successive reaction stage decreases 
so that later nuclear burning stages become shorter and shorter.

<li>Once fusion reactions have produced an iron core, further fusion reactions
no longer produce energy, but absorb energy from the stellar core.  As we 
shall see this may have a catastrophic effect on the star as it nears the end 
of its life.
</ol>
<p>
In stars like the sun, Carbon produced by helium burning via the Triple-alpha 
process will react with available helium nuclei to produce oxygen:
<ul>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>12</sup>C + <sup>4</sup>He  --> <sup>16</sup>0 + gamma-ray
</font></ul><p>
with some production of Neon, but the extreme electrical repulsion makes 
it difficult to produce nuclei more massive than Neon via helium-capture.
<ul>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>16</sup>0 + <sup>4</sup>He  --> <sup>20</sup>Ne + gamma-ray
</font></ul>
<p>
In more massive stars with temperatures greater than about 500 million K,
Carbon burning will occur.  This is just one of a variety of possible 
reactions:
<ul>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>12</sup>C + <sup>12</sup>C  --> <sup>24</sup>Mg + gamma-ray
</font></ul><p>
And above 1 billion K, Oxygen burning may occur; again with a variety of 
possible reaction products (<i>e.g.</i>Sulfur, as shown, Magnesium, Silicon 
&amp; Phosphorus):
<ul>
<font size=+1 color="red">
<li><sup>16</sup>0 + <sup>16</sup>0  --> <sup>32</sup>S + gamma-ray
</font></ul>
<p>
Finally, at temperatures greater than about 3 billion K, Silicon burning 
occurs through a series of reactions that produce nuclei near the "iron-peak",
that is near <sup>56</sup>Fe on the Periodic Table, the element with the most 
strongly bound nucleus.

<a name="neutrino"><font size=+2 color="burgundy"><u>
The Solar Neutrino "Problem"</u></font></a>
<p>
Neutrinos were first "invented" by W. Pauli (of <i>Exclusion Principle</i> 
fame) in order to explain apparent failures in conservation of energy, 
momentum and leptons in certain nuclear decays.  Pauli reasoned that these 
particles must be chargeless, have a mass much lower than the mass of the 
electron and interact only very weakly with other matter.  He called them 
"neutrons", but when the massive baryon that we now call the neutron was 
discovered, it was realized that this could not be Pauli's particle and the 
name of the hypothetical particle was changed to "neutrino".  The existence 
of the neutrino was confirmed by Reines and Cowan in 1956.
<p>
Although astrophysicists have great confidence in their calculations of the 
structure and evolution of stars like the sun, there is no substitute for 
experimental confirmation.  Because the neutrinos are the only nuclear 
reaction products that make it out from the solar core, the most direct 
confirmation of the theories would be to measure the neutrinos emitted by 
the sun's P-P chain.  The first experiment, begun in 1970 used a 100,000
gallon tank of cleaning fluid called perchloroethylene 
-- C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> to detect neutrinos from a subsidiary branch 
of the Proton-Proton Chain via the weak interaction: <p>

<center><sup>37</sup>Cl + <sub><img src="./images/doodads/nue.gif"></sub> -->
			<sup>37</sup>Ar + e<sup>-</sup></center></p>

The experiment was placed a mile underground in the Homestake gold mine in 
Lead, SD to avoid contamination from other particle interactions.  The 
experiment was predicted to create 3 Argon atoms, which could be counted by 
their radioactivity, every other day, but only about 1/3 that number were 
detected.  The experiment has continued for over 20 years and has recently 
been joined by other solar neutrino experiments in Japan (Kamiokande),
Russia (SAGE = Soviet(sic)-American Gallium Experiment) and Italy
(GALLEX), all reporting the same result.  
<p>
The most promising resolution of this problem lies in the physics of the 
neutrino itself.
There are three flavors of leptons -- electrons (with their associated
anti-particle the positron), muons and tau leptons, each with an associated 
flavor of neutrino, <sub><img src="./images/doodads/nue.gif"></sub>,
<sub><sub><img src="./images/doodads/numu.gif"></sub></sub> and 
<sub><sub><img src="./images/doodads/nutau.gif"></sub></sub>.  In an extension 
of the electroweak unified force theory it has been proposed that neutrinos 
can "oscillate" among these three flavors.  If this theory is correct, then 
the electron neutrinos produced by the solar nuclear fusion reactions may be 
oscillating among flavors as they travel toward earth, producing the apparent 
deficit.  One implication of this idea is that neutrinos must have a small
but non-zero mass.  Current limits place the mass of the electron neutrino 
at less than 1/100000 th the mass of the electron.  Recent experimental 
results appear to confirm this theory.
