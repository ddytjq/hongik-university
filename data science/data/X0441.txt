He returned to Michigan Tech this fall to enter the PhDprogram in the Department of Mining Engineering. Hodges had earnedtwo degrees from Michigan Tech, a BS in Civil Engineering in 1977 andan AAS in Civil Engineering Technology in 1972.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">He was well known locally as an avidsportsman and was inducted recently into the International FrisbeeHall of Fame, at the Houghton County Historical Museum in LakeLinden.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">"As fierce a competitor as he was on field,he was a genuine gentleman off the field," said his long-time friend,Dennis Walikainen, director of marketing communications and a fellowFrisbee player. "He was a great combination of intense sportsman,gentleman, and friend.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">"He was also really good at golf, excellentat billiards, and a good hockey player when he was a kid. When hedied, a lot of the sports worlds in the Copper Country weredevastated. And on top of it, he was a really intelligent humanbeing."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">"He was open and friendly and down toearth," said Ron Mauno (technology), a training specialist who hadworked with Hodges. "He kept really busy with his teaching andconsulting, but he was involved in many recreational sports andfollowed his son's hockey.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">"And the students seemed to enjoy his laidback teaching style, but he made sure they learned," Mauno said,adding, "&#91;His death&#93; was quite a shock."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Associate Professor Dae Young (miningengineering) was advising Hodges as he commenced his PhD studies. "Hewas hard-working, mature, and a good student," said Young. "When Iheard about &#91;the accident&#93;, I couldn't believeit."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Hodges came to the mining engineeringdepartment as a mining doctoral fellow, sponsored by the U.S.Department of Education's Graduate Assistance in Area of NationalNeed program. He brought with him a wealth of experience, both as aprofessional engineer and as a teacher, and anticipated completinghis PhD in two years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">With Young, he had planned to research thegeotechnical characteristics of mine wastes. Once their propertieswere known, they could then be developed as construction materials,Young said. "We lost a good PhD candidate and a good professionalengineer for the nation," Young said. "I feel that I lost not only mystudent, but also my friend."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Hodges, a Laurium native, lived in Calumetwith his wife, Julie, and their son, Ian. His daughter, Mollie(Kenneth) Rowe, lives in Calumet.</FONT></P><P><A HREF="http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/~dkwalika/frisbee/"><FONT FACE="Helvetica">GutsFrisbee Home Page</FONT></A></P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
