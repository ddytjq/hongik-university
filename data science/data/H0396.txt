<h2><a id="introduction" name=

<p><i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> ("ancient wing from
the printing stone").</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/letters/N.gif" align="left" alt="N" 
     width="47" height="45" />amed after the limestone in which it was discovered.
The stone is a smooth, fine grained limestone which was
used in printing. Quarried from in and around the Solnhofen
area of Germany. Formed on the bottom of a hypersaline
lagoon in the Late Jurassic, about 150 million years
ago.</p>

<h2><a id="specimens" name=
"specimens"></a><i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens</h2>

<p>There have been 8 specimens of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
found (7 actual specimens and one feather). These finds are
documented chronologically (by description) below.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>The Feather</b> 

<p>Found in 1860 near Solnhofen and a revelation when it
was described by H. v Meyer in 1861. The surprise was not
the age of the fossil, since several ornithopod dinosaur
footprints erroneously ascribed to birds were known from
the Triassic, but the detail that was preserved.</p>

</td>
<td>Found in 1861, near Langenaltheim. Probably the best
known (together with the Berlin specimen). Its discovery
was announced by H. v Meyer in 1861 and the specimen was
subsequently bought by the British Museum of Natural
History in London (under the instruction of Richard Owen).
It cost 700 UK Pounds - a small fortune in those times, but
for that price Owen also received just over a thousand
other fossils from Solnhofen. The specimen was sold by
amateur collector and local doctor Carl Haberlein, who had
received it in lieu of payment for medical treatment. Owen
described the specimen in 1863. He saw at once that it was
an important find and recognised that it represented a
transitional form - but not in the "Darwin" sense. Owen was
a staunch "evolutionist", however he did not believe in
Darwin's model of evolution. Interestingly Huxley, who
<b>was</b> a staunch "Darwinist" failed to recognise the
true import of the fossil and merely remarked on it as a
"reptile-like bird". It wasn't until close comparisons were
made with the dinosaur <i>Compsognathus</i> that Archae's
true worth was realised.</td>

a better specimen than the London specimen, principally
because it had a complete head, albeit badly crushed, and
was snapped up by the Berlin museum. It was sold to them by
Carl Haberlein's son (talk about keeping it in the
family!). It was described by W. Dames in 1884.<br />

specimen was found to be missing and it is thought that it
was sold secretly (<a href="#Abbott1992">Abbott 1992</a>).

It also differs in other aspects such as the tooth
structure and the poorly ossified shoulder bones. It has
been suggested that this is a separate genus, however the
differences can also be ascribed to the possible juvenile
stage of the animal and/or a different feeding niche.
However, this specimen has the best preserved head, from
which the litany of Archae's reptilian cranial features
were described. At the moment it still resides within <i>A.

<li><b>The Solnhofen-Aktien-Verein specimen</b> 

<p>A new specimen was described by Wellnhofer (<a href=
"#Wellnhofer1993">1993</a>), but the description is in
German and so information is limited. The specimen has been
classified as a new species, <i>Archaeopteryx bavarica</i>,
and has been reported as possessing a small ossified
sternum, as well as feather impressions.</p>

<h2><a id="features" name=
"features"></a><i>Archaeopteryx</i> Features</h2>

<p>Much has been made in pseudoscientific circles about the
position of Archae within the evolutionary scheme of
things. The usual "argument" put forward is that Archae
cannot be a transitional fossil between birds and dinosaurs
because it is a bird. This simplistic line belies the fact
that, whilst Archae is indeed classified as a bird, it has
been done so on the strength of 4 main characters - 2 of
which are not unique to birds. This classification ignores
the fact that Archae has numerous characters which
<b>are</b> unique, unique in that they are <b>not</b>
possessed by birds. Archae's avian affinities are allowable
on the strength of the following 4 main characters:</p>

<h3><a id="avian-features" name=
"avian-features"></a>Archaeopteryx's avian features</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>1) Feathers.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Feathers are <b>the</b> diagnostic feature of modern
birds. This is one of the main criterion for classifying
Archae as a bird, as no other modern animal has feathers.
The possession of feathers is a characteristic of birds, so
strike one up for the birds. <b>However</b>, in late 1996,
a discovery in China may change this view. A small theropod
dinosaur <i>Sinosauropteryx</i> 
(<a href="#Chen1998">Chen et al. 1998</a>) was
found with what appear to be feathers preserved along the
back. The identification of the sturctures is equivocal
however, (e.g. <a href="#Unwin1998">Unwin 1998</a>), with
some doubting that the structures are feathers.</p>

<center>
<h2>STOP PRESS</h2>

<p><b>Feathered Dinosaurs Found</b></p>
</center>

<p>Two species of dinosaur have recently been found in
northeast China which possess feathers 
(<a href="#Qiang1998">Qiang et al. 1998</a>).
<i>Protoarchaeopteryx robusta</i> and <i>Caudipteryx
zoui</i> show regiges, rectrices and plumulaceous feather
inpressions. Further, they are not birds, lacking a
reverted (backwards facing) big toe (see number 2 below)
and a quadrratojugal squamosal contact, having a
quadrojugal joined to the quatrate by a ligament and a
reduced or absent process of the ishium. These and other
characters group <i>Protoarchaeopteryx</i> and
<i>Caudipteryx</i> with maniraptoran coelurosaurs rather
than birds.</p>

<p>[Systematics Note (from <a href="#Padian1998">Padian
1998</a>): Systematists <i>define</i> the names of
organisms by their ancestry, in this case birds (Aves)
consist of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> plus living birds and all
the descendants of their most recent common ancester. Birds
are <i>diagnosed</i> by unique features that only they
possess and which are inherited from that common ancester.
Even if feathers are shared by a wider group than just
birds, birds are still defined as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
later relatives. <i>Protoarchaeopteryx</i> and
<i>Caudipteryx</i> are not birds even though they have
feathers because the suite of morphological characters they
possess mark them as belong to the maniraptoran coelurosaur
dinosarus.]</p>

<p>It appears that feathers can no longer be used as a
unique feature of birds.</p>

<p>For a discussion of the feathered dinosaurs go to <a
href=
"http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/protocauddisc.html">Jeff
Poling's Dinosauria page</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>2) Opposable hallux (big toe).</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>This also is a character of birds and not of dinosaurs.
Although opposable big toes are found in other groups, they
are not, as far as I am aware, found in dinosaurs. A
reversed big toe is found in some dinosaurs however, and
the condition is approached in some theropod dinosaurs.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>3) Furcula (wishbone) formed of two clavicles fused
together in the midline.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Now we start getting on shaky ground. It used to be
thought that the possession of a furcula distinguished
birds from dinosaurs. Indeed, up until recently even
clavicles were few and far between in even theropod
dinosaurs (the suggested closest group to the birds and
from which the birds evolved - see <a href=
"#Ostrom1976">Ostrom 1976</a>). However, it has been found
that theropod dinosaurs did indeed have clavicles (e.g. <a
href="#Bryant1993">Bryant &amp; Russell 1993</a>) and they
have been found in several species, e.g., <i>Segisaurus,
Velociraptor, Euparkeria, Ornithosuchus, Saltoposuchus,
Ticinosuchus.</i> Also, Chure &amp; Madson (<a href=
"#Chure1996">1996</a>) reported furculae in a
non-maniraptoran, allosaurid dinosaur.</p>

<p>It has been found that the clavicles are often small and
poorly ossified. This is no surprise, since they are of
little evolutionary advantage to your average theropod
dinosaur. However, birds too show this variation in
ossification, especially amongst the carniates and some
parrots, clavicles are reduced or even missing. Therefore
the apparent absence of clavicles in some theropod
dinosaurs may well be due to poor ossification rather than
true absence. However, furculas <b>have</b> been found in
some theropod dinosaurs, namely the Oviraptorosauria
(<a href="#Barsbold1990">Barsbold <i>et al.</i> 1990</a>, 
<a href="#Bryant1993">Bryant &amp; Russell 1993</a>),
for example <i>Oviraptor</i> and <i>Ingenia</i>. Thus
furculas do <b>not</b> appear to be diagnostic to birds and
certain members of the suggested closest group to the birds
now appear to possess furculas so it is a neutral
character.</p>

<p>A commonly cited criticism of this is that most of the
theropod dinosaurs listed here post-date Archae. However,
none of these is claimed as the ancestor anyway, and
<i>Eupakeria</i> is a Triassic form. The presence of
clavicles shows that this character is a feature of
theropod dinosaurs and thus was probably present in early
theropods.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>4) Pubis elongate and directed backward.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>This is a feature of birds, but it is also a feature of
some theropod dinosaurs so is not diagnostic of birds -
another neutral character. However, the pubic shafts of
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and dromaeosaurs (a group of theropod
dinosaurs which are thought to be closely linked to birds)
share a plate-like, slightly angled transverse
cross-section which not found in any other archosaurs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="reptile-features" name=
"reptile-features"></a>Archaeopteryx's reptile
features</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>5) Premaxilla and maxilla are not
horn-covered.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>This is posh talk for "does not have a bill." The
premaxilla does not have a keratinized covering, so
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> has no bill. The bill is produced via
the process of 'cornification' which involves the mucus
layer of the epidermis (<a href="#Romanoff1960">Romanoff
1960</a>) and thus its formation is independant of jaw bone
formation.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>6) Trunk region vertebra are free.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>In birds the trunk vertebrae are always fused.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>7) Bones are pneumatic.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>I.e. they appear to have air-sacs, as they do in birds
and in some dinosaurs (e.g. <a href="#Witmer1990">Witmer
1990</a>, <a href="#Brooks1993">Brooks 1993</a>). It should
be pointed out that previous claims suggesting the bones of
Archae were not pneumatic (<a href=
"#Lambrecht1933">Lambrecht 1933</a>; <a href="#de1954">de
Beer 1954</a>), was based on negative evidence, i.e. that
the bones do not exhibit pneumatic pores (through which the
air sacs enter the bones) and the bones show none of the
plumpness and bulges which characterise the pneumatic bones
of modern birds. Britt et al. (<a href=
"#Britt1998">1998</a>) found evidence for the presence of
pnematic bones in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>:</p>

<p>"Here we re-examine two specimens of _Archaeopteryx_.
These specimens show evidence of vertebral pneumaticity in
the cervical and anterior thorasic vertebrae, thus
confirming the phylogenetic continuity between the
pneumatic systems of non-avialan theropods and living
birds" (<a href="#Britt1998">Britt et al. 1998</a>, p.
374)</p>

<b>8) Pubic shafts with a plate-like, and slightly angled
transverse cross-section</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A Character shared with dromaeosaurs but not with other
dinosaurs or birds</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>9) Cerebral hemispheres elongate, slender and
cerebellum is situated behind the mid-brain and doesn't
overlap it from behind or press down on it.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>This again is a reptilian feature. In birds the cerebral
hemispheres are stout, cerebellum is so much enlarged that
it spreads forwards over the mid-brain and compresses it
downwards. Thus the shape of the brain is not like that of
modern birds, but rather an intermediate stage between
dinosaurs and birds (e.g. <a href=
"#Alexander1990">Alexander 1990</a>).</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>10) Neck attaches to skull from the rear as in
dinosaurs not from below as in modern birds.</b></dt>

<dd>The site of neck attachement (from below) is
characteristic in birds, _Archaeopteryx_ does not have this
character, but is the same as theropod dinosaurs: 

<p>"Notice that this coelurosaurian-like neck extended back
from the rear of the skull in _Archaeopteryx_ - as it does
in coelurosaurs [theropod dinosaurs], rather than from
beneath as in later birds." (<a href="#Ostrom1976">Ostrom
1976</a>, p. 137).</p>

<p>Skull and brain of Archae is basically reptilian and is
not "totally birdlike" (contrary to a certain creationist's
claim).</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>11) Center of cervical vertebrae have simple concave
articular facets.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>This is the same as the archosaur pattern. In birds the
vertebrae are different, they have a saddle-shaped
surface:</p>

<p>"The most striking feature of the vertebrae is the
simple disk-like facets of their centra, without any sign
of the saddle-shaped articulations found in other birds"
(<a href="#de1954">de Beer 1954</a>, p. 17).</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>12) Long bony tail with many free vertebrae up to
tip (no pygostyle).</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Birds have a short tail and the caudal vertebrae are
fused to give the pygostyle.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>13) Premaxilla and maxilla bones bear
teeth.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>No modern bird possess teeth (e.g. <a href=
"#Romanoff1960">Romanoff 1960</a>; <a href="#Orr1966">Orr
1966</a>, p. 113). Bird embryos form tooth buds, but do not
actually produce teeth. Some birds subsequently produce
ridges in the bill, but there is no connection between them
and the embryonic tooth buds, since the ridges also form in
other areas of the bill where no tooth buds have previouslu
formed. Some birds produce hook-like structures which are
papillae, and appear to be related to the process of
keratinization of the beak (<a href=
"#Romanoff1960">Romanoff 1960</a>), and have nothing to do
with teeth. They do not possess blood vessel or nerve
connections, nor do they produce dentine.</p>

<p>The expression of tooth buds in the bird embryo has a
simple evolutionary explanation, since it suggests that the
ancestors of modern birds possessed teeth and that this
character has been supressed in modern birds. The presence
of tooth buds in the embryos of organisms which do not
possess teeth in the adult is a difficulty for
anti-evolutionists, since why should a character be
expressed that is never used in the organism? Some fossil
birds exhibit a reduction in the number of bones which have
teeth. Both <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Baptornis</i> lack
teeth on the premaxilla (<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and theropod
dinosaurs have teeth on both the maxilla and premaxilla).
Not only that, <i>Hesperornis</i> has a beak, but on the
upper jaw only (<a href="#Gingerich1975">Gingerich
1975</a>). It therefore has <b>half</b> a beak <b>and</b>
teeth. A good example of a morphologicaly intermediate
structure between toothed birds which lack a beak, and
beaked, toothless birds.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>14) Ribs slender, without joints or uncinate
processes and do not articulate with the sternum.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Birds have stout ribs with uncinate processes (braces
between them) and articulate with the sternum.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>15) Pelvic girdle and femur joint is archosaurian
rather than avian (except for the backward pointing pubis
as mentioned above).</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Here Archae really shows its transitional nature. Whilst
the pelvic girdle as a whole is basically free and similar
to archosaur girdles, the pubis points backward - a
character shared with birds and some other bird-like
theropod dinosaurs.</p>

<p>What <b>is</b> interesting is that with the bird
pelvis:</p>

<p>"The ischium lies beneath the posterior part of the
ilium and beneath this again is the pubis, which is
directed backwards (i.e. like this: =). Embryological
studies show that the peculiar position of these bones is
the result of secondary rotation and that the pectineal
process, in front of the ascetabulum, is not the true pubis
as some workers have maintained." (<a href=
"#Bellairs1960">Bellairs &amp; Jenkin 1960</a>, p.
258).</p>

<p>In other words, the embyonic pelvis of the bird, when
first formed, looks, in shape and angle between the ilium
and the pubis (45 degrees), very similar to the "A"-frame
pelvis of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (i.e. like this: &lt;) (e.g.
<a href="#Romanoff1960">Romanoff 1960</a>). The fully
formed pelvis with all bones lying parallel is the result
of secondary rotation of the pubis from "&lt;" to "=". This
supports the view that birds had an ancester with a
saurischian pelvis such as the type possessed by
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and other theropod dinosaurs. (see
also <a href="#pelvis">A tale of two pelvises</a>
below)</p>

<p>This is the same as in reptiles and especially
ornithipod dinosaurs. The bird sacrum covers between 11-23
vertebrae! So, while the variation seen in modern birds is
large, it is nowhere near the number found in
<i>Archaeopteryx</i></p>
</dd>

<dt><b>17) Metacarpals (hand) free (except 3rd metacarpal),
wrist hand joint flexible.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>This is as in reptiles. In birds the metacarpals are
fused together with the distal carpals in the
carpo-metacarpus, wrist /hand fused. All modern birds have
a carpo-metacarpus, all fossil birds have a
carpo-metacarpus - except one (guess!) :-). However, the
carpals of several coelurosaur dinosaur groups show a trend
towards fusion, and in the Late Cretaceous form
<i>Avimimus</i>, a true carpo- metacarpus is formed.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the ostrich and/or other <a
href="#Ratites">Ratites</a> also possess unfused wrist/hand
bones. This is not correct:</p>

<p>"The ostrich, emus, rheas, cassowaries and kiwis are
often referred to together as the Ratites, though they may
not be closely related to each other. They have tiny wings
and cannot fly, but the bones of their hands are fused
together in the same peculiar way as in flying birds, which
suggest that they evolved from flying birds." (<a href=
"#Alexander1990">Alexander 1990</a>, p. 435).</p>

<p>Some similarity between the hand of the ostrich and some
of the more derived theropod dinosaurs was once used to
suggest that the Ratites were 'primitive' and evolved
before the advent of flight in birds. However Tucker (<a
href="#Tucker1938b">1938b</a>) showed that such
similarities are entirely superficial.</p>

<p>"He has directed attention to the bird-like characters
of the hand of the dinosaur <i>Ornitholestes</i> as
evidence that a bird-like hand can be developed
independantly of flight, but the writer has pointed out in
the communication mentioned above [Tucker 1938b] that the
resemblance is utterly superficial and that the peculiar
bowing and terminal fusion of metacarpals 2 and 3 which
charcaterise both the Carnate and the Ratite hand are in no
wise [sic?] reproduced in the dinosaur." (<a href=
"#Tucker1938a">Tucker 1938a</a>, p. 334).</p>

<p>"Reverting now to the reasons on which have sought to
base the view that the Ratites were primitive birds whose
ancesters had never flown, one: the similarity between the
hand of the ostrich and that of the dinosaur, has been
dismissed as invalid. Tucker (<a href=
"#Tucker1938b">1938b</a>) has shown that such resemblances
as there are between them are only superficial and without
significance." (<a href="#de1956">de Beer 1956</a>, p.

<dt><b>20) Claws on 3 unfused digits.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>No modern adult bird has 3 claws, nor do they have
unfused digits. The juvenile hoatzin and Touracos do have 2
claws but loose them as they grow, the ostrich appears to
retain its 2 claws into adulthood, due to the early
termination of development (see section on <a href=
"#Ratites">Ratites</a>). In the case of the hoatzin it is
thought that these claws allow the juvenile to climb. It
had been claimed that since these birds do have claws, even
in the juvenile stage, then the presence of claws cannot be
used as a reptilian character. This is not so, however. In
fact almost all birds exhibit claws, but in the embryonic
stage and they are lost by the time the bird leaves the
egg. In the case of the few which do retain claws into the
juvenile stage, this is merely the extension of the
condition into the post-embryonic stage. As McGowan (<a
href="#McGowan1984">1984</a>, p 123) says:</p>

<p>"In retaining a primitive reptilian feature which other
birds lose just before leaving the egg [the hoatzin] is
showing us its reptilian pedigree. Far from being evidence
to the contrary, the hoatzin is additional evidence for the
reptilian ancestry of birds."</p>

<dt><b>21) The fibula is equal in length to the tibia in

</dd>

<dt><b>22) Metatarsals (foot bones) free.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>In birds these are fused to form the tarsometatarsus.
However, in modern bird embryos, the foot bones are
initially separate as in the adult <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
is another character supporting a reptilian ancestry for
birds. After all, why bother producing separate bones in
the embryo and then fuse them? Why not produce a fused mass
to start with? No adult modern bird has separate
metatarsals, but they are separated, initially, in the
embryo. This can be explained in terms of evolution - birds
evolved from a group which had unfused metatarsals.</p>

<p>Ceratosaurians, <i>Avimimus</i>, and Elmisauridae all
show true tarso-metatarsi. Archae itself only shows the
beginning of this structure.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>23) Gastralia present.</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Gastralia are "ventral ribs," elements of dermal bone in
the ventral wall of the abdomen. Typical of reptiles, they
are absent in birds, e.g.:</p>

<p>"In addition to the true ribs the British Museum
specimen shows a large number of so-called ventral ribs or
gastralia, elements of dermal bone lying in the ventral
wall of the abdomen." (<a href="#de1954">de Beer 1954</a>,

<p>"The gastralia of the Berlin specimen are identical with
those of the British Museum specimen, but more have been
preserved." (<a href="#de1954">de Beer 1954</a>, p. 19)</p>

<p>"The "new" specimen was found 8 September 1970 on
display in the Teyler Museum, Haarlem, Netherlands. It
consists of two small slabs (specimens 6928 &amp; 6929),
part and counterpart which contain impressions or parts of
the left manus and forearm, pelvis, both legs and feet, and
some gastralia." (<a href="#Ostrom1970">Ostrom 1970</a>, p.

<p>It can be seen that Archae possesses many more
characters which are present in dinosaurs and <b>not</b> in
birds, than it does characters which are present in birds
but not in dinosaurs. This is why Archae is a true
transitional species, because it shares some characters
which are diagnostic of one group whilst still retaining
characters diagnostic of its ancestral group. Anyone who
claims that Archae is 100% bird is wrong. Anyone who claims
that Archae's skeleton is even predominantly bird- like is
wrong. Anyone who claims Archae has a "totally birdlike"
skull is wrong.</p>

<p>This latter point is made in reference to the claim by
Dr. Duane Gish that the skull of Archae is "totally
birdlike" (R. Trott pers. comm. 1994). This claim is false.
To show this we need to consider the skull of Archae
further.</p>

<h3><a id="cranial-features" name=
"cranial-features"></a>Cranial features of
Archaeopteryx</h3>

<p>As stated above, Dr Gish claims that the skull of Archae
is "totally birdlike." This is false. Romer (<a href=
"#Romer1950">1950</a> p. 261) describes Archae thus: "The
skull, as far as can be seen, was rather birdlike. . . ".
However, not only is this a far cry from "totally
birdlike," but Romer was using the detailed reconstruction
of the Berlin Specimen, by Heilmann (<a href=
"#Heilmann1926">1926</a>). Ostrom (<a href=
"#Ostrom1976">1976</a> p. 131) has this to say on the
Heilmann reconstruction:</p>

<blockquote>"Despite the details shown there [Heilmann's
reconstruction of the skull -cn], the actual specimen does
not permit such detailed and precise conclusions. It [the
Berlin specimen's skull - cn] is badly crushed and the
bones are extensively fracture, chipped and distorted - to
the extent that very few cranial or mandibular sutures are
unmistakably identifiable. Heilmann's reconstructions have
been republished by many authors and subsequent
interpretations and hypotheses based on it. Quite probably,
some authors have been unaware of the inadequate basis of
Heilmann's reconstruction, and understandably so unless
they have had the opportunity to examine the specimen
itself."</blockquote>

<p>And again on the same page:</p>

<blockquote>"Fortunately, the Eichstatt speciman now
provides a comparative basis for evaluating and correcting
past reconstructions of the Berlin skull."</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, the Eichstatt specimen was not
described until 1974, therefore Romer's description was
based on the Heilmann reconstruction.</p>

<p>Using both specimens, Ostrom (<a href=
"#Ostrom1976">1976</a> p. 132) delineated 10 characters on
the skull of Archae which it shares with other theropod
dinosaurs such as <i>Ornitholestes</i>,
<i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i> and perhaps
<i>Saurornithoides</i>. These are:</p>

<ol>
<li>A sharply tapered snout. In birds the maxilla makes up
the "snout". Although the snout is shortened in
Archae.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>Long elliptical external nares [nostrils] bounded
almost exclusively above and below by the premaxilla and
nasal (a bone at the front of the upper jaw). In birds the
nares are reduced and removed posteriorly (closer to the
eyes) due to the increase in size of the premaxilla.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A large preorbital fossa and a large triangular
postorbital fossa which contains two small openings.(These
are holes in the skull. One is a single opening in front of
the orbit or eye socket, the other is behind the eye socket
and has two openings). In other fossil birds the preorbital
is reduced, the postorbital has only a single opening. In
modern birds the preorbital is greatly reduced and the
postorbital has a single opening.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A slender, nearly vertical preorbital bar separating
the antorbital fossa and the orbit (There's that hole
again! This means that there is a vertical bar of bone
separating the hole in front of the eye with the eye
itself). Fossil and modern birds have a much more robust
preorbital bar - due to the reduction of the preorbital
fossa.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A large circular orbit which contains a large sclerotic
ring.(The sclerotic ring is common to reptiles, birds and
actinoptygian fish, but most fossil reptiles and all fossil
birds have them. They are a series of ossified plates which
circle the eye).<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A thin, straight jugal bone makes up the zygomatic arch
(this is the bone that runs under the eye, the cheek-bone
as it extends back towards your ear, in humans). In modern
birds the arch is composed of the quadratojugal, jugal and
maxilla bones.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A stout quadrate of moderate length which is inclined
forward. This is the bone in the upper jaw which forms part
of the jaw articulation - with the articular - in reptiles,
and Archae has a big one, um if you see what I mean!
(Incidentally - for those of you who are still with us, the
quadrate is attached to the stapes in the upper jaw, and as
we all know, the stapes is the bone which vibrates in the
ear so that we can all hear. Thus the stapes and quadrate
were attached in reptiles and it is not a great leap
forward to have both the stapes and the quadrate in the ear
as it is in mammals. Thus the claim made by Gish that - in
order for the bones to enter the ear in the transition from
reptiles to mammals they would have had to gone through a
stage whereby the 'mammal' would have deafened itself every
time it opened its mouth - is not accurate, since the
condition of stapes+quadrate articulating in the jaw joint
<b>is found in fossil and extant reptiles</b>, but I
digress.)<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A lower jaw which is unusually shallow and has a
conspicuous bend behind the tooth row. Not in birds.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A long retroarticular process. Again a classic reptile
jaw-joint feature, but shared with birds.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>Premaxilla, lacrimal and jugal bones separate. In birds
the premaxilla bone is connected to the, jugal bone; the
jugal bone is connected to the, lacrimal bone. . .
:-)<br />
<br />
</li>
</ol>

Recently Elzanowski &amp; Wellenhofer (<a href=
"#Elzanowski1996">1996</a>) have highlighted some more
similarities between the skull of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
those of theropod dinosaurs: 

<ol>
<li>A single vomer.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>Strong curvature of the ectopterygoid hook.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>A dorsal recess in the prootic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although <i>Archaeopteryx</i> does have certain skull
characters which are avian, these are insufficiant to allow
the characterization "totally birdlike".</p>

<p>Heilmann described an external mandibular fenestra (a
hole in the lower jaw) bordered below by the dentary bone -
which is the condition in birds - rather than by the
angular bone - as it is in reptiles. This would indicate
that Archae has a lower jaw which contained both avian
(said mandibular fenestra) and reptilian features (toothed
lower jaw). This is all very well and dandy and is a
feature which one would like to see in Archae. However, as
Ostrom (<a href="#Ostrom1976">1976</a> p. 132) points
out:</p>

<blockquote>"Much as I would like to accept this
interpretation, the highly fractured condition of the lower
jaw bone (or bones) that border the supposed mandibular
fenestra, either below or above, make it impossible to
certify their identifications. In fact, the fractured upper
margins of the supposed fenestra leave considerable doubt
as to the very existence of a 'fenestra' - a doubt which
has not been removed by the Eichstatt specimen." Thus, far
from conspiring to present Archae in the best possible
light, a very useful feature which would have aided in the
description of Archae as a true transitional fossil has in
fact been show to be, in all probability, not true. So much
for the evilutionist conspiracy! Indeed the seventh
specimen shows that a mandibular fenestra is absent (<a
href="#Elzanowski1996">Elzanowski &amp; Wellnhofer
1996</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Another important feature of the skull of Archae is the
occipital condyle and the foramen magnum. In Archae these
are well above the dorsal end of the quadrate. As Ostrom
(<a href="#Ostrom1976">1976</a> p. 136) writes:</p>

<blockquote>"This primitive condition is characteristic of
both pseudosuchians and theropods, in contrast to all later
birds where the occipital condyle and foramen magnum are at
the base of the skull, well below the level of the upper
extremity of the quadrate. In this feature,
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> was far from avian."</blockquote>

Whetstone (<a href="#Whetstone1983">1983</a>, p. 449) does
describe the <b>braincase</b> (as opposed to the
<b>skull</b>) of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> as, "typically
avian", however, he also describes skull features found in
<i>Archaeopyteryx</i> and not in birds. 

<p>More recently there has been some conjecture as to the
structure of the quadrate bone in Archae. The quadrate from
the Eichstatt specimen was described as being single headed
- i.e. the top of the quadrate has only one rounded knob
which articulates with the skull in only one place. In all
modern birds, the quadrate is double headed - i.e. the top
of the quadrate has two rounded knobs and therefore
articulates with the skull in two places. Based on computer
tomography a buried portion of the skull of the Eichstatt
specimen, Haubiltz et al. (1988) suggested that Archae
possessed a double headed quadrate. However, the image is
poor and the presence of another bone underlying the
quadrate cannot be ruled out. The only quadrate found in
place in any specimen is single headed and a similar bone
from the London specimen which appears to be the quadrate,
is also single headed. Identification of the quadrate in
the seventh specimen has confirmed that the bone was single
headed (<a href="#Elzanowski1996">Elzanowski &amp;
Wellnhofer 1996</a>). Thus the quadrate of Archae appears
to be reptilian and not avian.</p>

<p>As can be seen, Archae's skull is not "totally
birdlike." The "totally birdlike" claim is without
foundation.</p>

<p>One is that the differences seen between
_Archaeopteryx_, fossil birds and modern birds can be
explained as just variation within birds. Allied to this is
the claim that some modern birds (Ratites) share a number
morphological features with _Archaeopteryx_.</p>

<h2><a id="variation" name=
"variation"></a><i>Archaeopteryx</i> + modern birds, just
variation within kind?</h2>

<p>It has been suggested that the differences between
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and modern birds represents simple
within-group variation. However, this is not correct.
Modern birds show a large number of derived morphological
characters not possessed by <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.
Morphologically, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> clearly appears more
closely related to theropod dinosaurs that any other group
and is grouped with birds over theropod dinosaurs due to
the possession of only two main characters, presence of
feathers, and presence of a fully reverted hallux
(toe).</p>

<p>The relevant morphological variation can be represented
graphically (if crudely) in the following figure:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As can be seen, the variation within birds shows a
distinct trend. The more "reptile"-like morphologies occur
in the earliest birds, with the typical 'modern' bird
morphology restricted to later birds. If, as suggested,
morphological variation is simply variation within birds,
we would expect to see the various morphological groups
(fossil birds, modern birds) evenly spread throughout the
relevant time interval. If, however, birds evolved from
theropod dinosaurs, then we would expect to see the first
birds to posses more "reptile"-like characters and the more
derived, modern birds to have less "reptile"-like
characters. This, in fact, is what we see. Thus the
distribution of characters within birds supports their
derivation from theropod dinosaur ancesters and does not
support the claim that variation is simply 'within
kind'.</p>

<h2><a id="Ratites" name="Ratites"></a>Ratites</h2>

<p>Much is made of the morphological features of the
Ratites (ostriches, kiwi's etc.), and superficially it may
seem that these birds support the 'variation within kind'

<p>Importantly however, other morphological characters
possessed by Ratites clearly show that they are derived
from a modern, flying bird morphology and thus the Ratites
are actually neotonous on modern birds, with their more
"reptile"-like characters due to the early termination of
development, leaving them with some morphological
characters similar to <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and some fossil
birds (see <a href="#Ratites1">below</a>). These characters
are developmental and therefore provide further supporting
evidence for a theropod dinosaur-bird link.</p>

<h2><a id="pelvis" name="pelvis"></a>A tale of two
pelvises</h2>

<p>Dinosaurs can be divided into two groups based on the
shape of the pelvis. The Saurischia, or 'lizard hipped'
dinosaurs, and the Ornithischia, or 'bird hipped'
dinosaurs. Strange as it may seem, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
all modern birds are thought to have evolved from the
Saurischia, not from the bird hipped, Ornithischia! Odd?
Well, not really. The pelvises in question are shown in
Fig.1.</p>

<center><b>Fig. 1</b><br />
<img src="pelvis.gif" width="432" height="122" alt=
"Pelvises of saurischian, ornitheschian, and Archaeopteryx" /></center>

<p>The saurischian pelvis (Fig.1a) is the more primitive
structure, and has the pubis pointing forwards and the
ischium backwards. In ornithischians (Fig. 1b), the pubis
runs back in parallel with the ischium. Additionally, a
prepubic process is present, which is assumed to have been
used as a point of muscle attachment in the absence of the
pubis (probably to support the gut). This situation is
superficially similar to that in birds (hence the name
'bird hipped' - the pelvis of birds was well known to
anatomists by the time dinosaurs were being described).
However, on closer examination, clear differences are
evident. In <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Fig. 1c) and all birds,
the prepubic process is absent and, unlike in saurischians,
the pubis do not meet along the midline. Also, in
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> the pubis still maintains the
club-like termination, as in many saurischians. It should
also be noted that several saurischian dinosaurs have the
pubis facing backward, e.g. <i>Troodon</i>. The pelvis of
<i>Archaeopterys</i> is morphologically intermediate
between saurischian dinosaurs and birds.</p>

<p>But why did this occur? Well, the primary thrust
generator in earlier theropods was the Caudofemoralis
longus, which streched from the leg to some distance along
the tail. Later forms such as the dromaeosaurids (the group
closely related to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>) rearranged this so
that the primary thrust was produced by muscles attaching
from the leg to the pelvis and the base of the tail. This
allowed the tail to be braced and used as a stabilizing
device, such as in allosaurs and 'raptors, or to be lost as
in modern birds.</p>

<p>In ornithischians the backwards pointing pubis probably
occurred to allow for the expansion of the stomach and gut
in order to better digest plant material.</p>

<p><a id="Ratites1" name="Ratites1"></a>Study of the
embryonic development of the modern bird pelvis is also
instructive. The embryonic pelvis in modern birds starts
out in a very similar configuration to
<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, with the ilium and pubis bones set
apart at an angle of approx. 45 degrees. The embryonic
bones then secondarily rotate through angles seen in modern
<a href="#Ratites">Ratites</a> until reaching the parallel
alignment typifing adult, modern birds (see <a href=
"#Romanoff1960">Romanoff 1960</a>, p. 1010):</p>

<p>The angle between the ilium and the pubis bones in the
pelvis of modern Ratites is intermediate between
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and modern birds, as would be expected
if:</p>

<p>A) Modern birds are descended from reptile-like
ancesters similar to <i>Archaeopteryx</i></p>

<p>B) Ratites are neotenous descendents of flying birds, in
which development has been halted prematurely.</p>

<h2><a id="to-fly" name="to-fly"></a>To fly or not to
fly</h2>

<p>Flying is a tricky business. However, flying confers
such a strong evolutionary advantage that it is not
surprising that the ability has evolved several times. The
success of birds provide ample evidence for the positive
benefits of flight. If it did fly, Archae must have
utilized much the same method as do birds today, therefore
a discussion on the possibility of flight in Archae must
consider those structures most relevant to flight in birds.
These are the feathers, the flexibility of the wing, muscle
bulk and the presence of a keeled sternum.</p>

<h3><a id="feathers" name="feathers"></a>Feathers</h3>

<p>Feathers are composed of a long, tapering, central
rachis, which bears closely spaced side branches called
barbs. The barbs on either side of the rachis constitute a
surface called the vane. The two vanes on the feather may
be symmetrical (i.e. the same width) or asymmetrical, in
which case the rachis appears closer to one edge of the
feather than the other. The flight feathers of modern birds
are typically asymmetrical, whilst body contour and
semiplume feathers are symmetrical.</p>

<p>In modern birds, remiges, or wing feathers, are highly
modified for power flight (e.g. <a href=
"#McFarland1985">McFarland et al. 1985</a>), primarily in
that the rachis is shifted towards the leading edge of the
feather (i.e. the leading vane is thinner than the trailing
vane), resulting in an asymmetric feather. The thinner or
leading vane of the feather overlaps the wider or trailing
vane of the feather in front of it (Fig. 2). The trailing
vane contains zones of friction barbules which grip the
overlapping feather and stop the feathers from slipping too
far apart.</p>

<p>Speakman &amp; Thomas (<a href="#Speakman1994">1994</a>)
compared the asymmetry of some of the flight feathers of
Archae (flight feathers 4, 5 and 6) with those of modern
flying and flightless birds and the isolated feather from
Solnhofen. They found that the average asymmetry for Archae
feathers was 1.25, which was lower than that of modern
flying birds (lowest around 2.2), but which overlapped that
of modern flightless birds. The isolated feather exhibited
an asymmetry of 2.2 - just within the range of modern
flying birds. However, it is not known whether this feather
<b>is</b> from Archae, or where on Archae the feather was
situated if it is an Archae feather. Norberg (<a href=
"#Norberg1995">1995</a>) correctly pointed out, that the
curvature of the feather is also important in flight
ability, and Archie's feathers exhibit significant
curvature. It appears as though Speakmean &amp; Thomas may
have measured the wrong feathers however. Paul Davis (pers.
comm. 1996) has pointed out that Speakman &amp; Thomas
appear to have numbered the primary feathers starting at
the wing tip and moving towards the body, whereas current
practice is to number the feathers starting from the body
and moving outwards along the wing (e.g. <a href=
"#Rietschel1985">Rietschel 1985</a>). This is important,
since the asymmetry of feathers decreases towards the wing
tip - thus Speakman &amp; Thomas appear to have measured
the feathers with lower asymmetry. Measurements of the
higher asymmetry feathers close to the boby yield valuse of
around 2.32 - which overlap the lower range for extant
flying birds (e.g. <a href="#Norberg1995">Norberg 1995</a>;
P.G. Davis pers. comm. 1996). The first flight feathers of
birds are always highly asymmetric however, and so this
result is equivocal. The bulk of the flight feathers on
Archae appear to have a slightly lower asymmetry than that
found in flying birds today. In reality however, feather
asymmetry is a bit of a red herring when it comes to flight
capability. Feathers are asymmetrical to maintain
aerodynamic integrity as they deform under aerodynamic
loads in flight, and thus the greatest asymmetry occurs in
birds in which such loads are greatest - i.e. birds with
high manouverability and climbing flight (J.M.V. Rayner,
pers. comm. 1995). Thus asymmetry is a derived condition
for a derived flight capability - one <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
never possessed. Thus it is not surprising that
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> possessed low asymmetry feathers, but
this does not preclude <i>Archaeopteryx</i> from
flying.</p>

<h3><a id="wing-flexibility" name=
"wing-flexibility"></a>Wing flexibility</h3>

<p>Consider the carniates [birds with a keeled sternum]
wing. A marvel of adaptation, well able to sustain quite
large animals in power flight for long distances. But what
is it about the anatomy of the wing that allows the
possibility of flight? Well simply put, 'it's all in the
wrist action.'</p>

<p>In modern birds the shoulder joint acts as a universal
joint, with a high degree of mobility not only adduction
[wing movement down], abduction [wing movement up] and
extension [extending wing away from body] and retraction
[pulling wing into body], but also significant rotation
along the log axis of the humerus.</p>

<p>The elbow, by contrast, is a very restrictive joint. It
only allows planar extension and flexure [in other words
unfolding and folding of the wing - i.e there is no
rotational component.</p>

<p>However, it is the wrist joint which is important. The
wrist is composed of two bony carpals which control the
movement of the joint. Distally beyond this is the fused
carpometacarpus - produced from a fusion of the remaining
carpal [wrist] bones and the metacapal [lower hand] bones.
Beyond that is the sometimes incompletely fused manus
composed of three digits. This complex, distal of the wrist
joint, comprises a near-rigid platform for the attachment
of the primary remiges [flight feathers], the secondary
remiges attach to the forearm.</p>

<p>The configuration of the wrist joint, articulating as it
does on two small, round carpels, allows an amazing range
of movement. To demonstrate this you need to be sitting
comfortably at the computer terminal. Extent your arms as
if you were about to type (palms down, hairy bits up). Now,
rotate your hands so that the palms are facing up (as if
you are carrying something). This rotation is carried out
by the wrist joint in birds. Note that in humans, this
action is carried out by rotation of the forearm and not
the wrist. Now, return the hands to the hairy bits up
position and rotate the hands so that the palm faces the
computer (the universal "stop" sign) and rotate the hand
down until the hairy bits point to the computer. This
rotation is carried out by the wrist joint in birds, as it
is in humans.</p>

<p>As you have now demonstrated, the carniate wrist is much
more flexible than the human wrist (you have also
demonstrated to any co-worker watching that you are insane
and in dire need of a holiday!). This flexibility is vital
to powered flight, since it allows the wrist/hand to
describe a lazy figure-of-eight during a complete flap.
Remember that the elbow joint allows no rotation, but the
wing must be able to present a solid open wing on the down
(power) stoke, but be able to rotate the wing during the
recovery (up) stroke to minimise resistance. The birds
accomplish this by rotating the wrist and shoulder.</p>

<p>At the top of the power stoke, the wrist is orientated
to present the maximum surface area to the air (palm facing
downward). During the power stroke, the wrist and hand
describes an "S", or two arcs representing the left hand
side of the upper loop and the right hand side of the lower
loop of an "8". At the bottom of the power stroke the wrist
and hand is at the bottom of the "8". During the start of
the recovery stroke the wrist reorients 90 degrees, thus
presenting the minimum surface area to the air. The wing
then completes the "8" by describing the left hand side of
the lower loop and the right hand side of the upper loop.
It is easier to perform than to read. Hold your right arm
out horizontally from the shoulder, with the palm pointing
downwards. Lock the elbow so that you cannot bend the arm,
only rotate it. Now the power stroke is an "S" shape,
keeping the palm pointing downwards and the elbow locked.
At the bottom of the "S", rotate the palm 90 degrees until
it is pointing forwards (actually you will have to rotate
your whole arm to do this, in birds it is done by the wrist
joint). Now, the recovery stroke is a mirror image "S",
completing an "8", as you reach the top of the stroke the
palm should twist back to point down again and you are
ready for the power stroke. Repeat a few times until you
get the feel of it or until someone sends for the guy's in
the white coats. That is how birds can fly and, hopefully,
you can now see the importance of having a flexible wrist
joint.</p>

<p>One last important point in this bit. Folding of the
wing occurs by contraction of the M. biceps brachii, which
is attached to the ulna. This movement automatically folds
the metacarpus and hand downward and inward, so that
folding at the wrist joint involves the M. biceps
brachii.</p>

<p>Now, the point of all this is: Does this arrangement
occur in Archae? Does this arrangement occur in
maniraptoran theropods? If so, what possible use could this
particular wrist joint be to maniraptoran theropods? Could
this be an example of preadaptation (gasp! Sorry to use the
"P" word).</p>

<p>Firstly, the wrist joint of Archae does indeed exhibit
<b>some</b> (but not all) of the features seen in the
modern carniate wrist joint. Most notably a lunate carpal,
hemispherical in shape, the flat portion of which
articulated with the carpometacarpus, leaving the rounded
end to articulate with the wrist joint. This provides a
flexible wrist joint, although not as flexible as in modern
carniates.</p>

<p>Secondly, this configuration is found in several
theropod taxa, such as <i>Deinonychus</i>,
<i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>. There are
two problems here, firstly all these forms postdate Archae,
they are all Cretaceous forms; secondly, what would be the
use of a nifty flexible wrist to a bunch of theropods which
are all teeth and toenails?</p>

<p>OK, problem one is easy to solve. It was a problem that
this feature occurred in Cretaceous theropods and in the
Late Jurassic Archae only, since to be an important feature
and to show a close link between theropods and Archae,
theropods coeval with Archae must have had this particular
arrangement. Introducing <i>Coelurus fragilis</i> a late
Jurassic theropod from America. This form does indeed
possess the a very similar wrist joint (<a href=
"#Ostrom1980">Ostrom 1980</a>) strengthening not only the
theropod-bird link, but also the theropod-Archae-bird
link.</p>

<p>The second problem is slightly harder. Why would such a
wrist joint be retained in maniraptoran theropods which are
dentally and toenail minded when it comes to killing?
Ostrom (<a href="#Ostrom1995">1995</a>) suggests that the
flexibility would come in useful where a grasping action of
the hands could augment the killing action of the teeth
and/or toenails. I would speculate further. In modern birds
the biceps are involved in the folding of the wing. If this
were extended to the theropods, the action of pulling the
prey into the body would tend to <i>strengthen</i> the grip
of the theropod by bringing into play the largest muscle on
the arm - the biceps, rather than just the wrist muscles.
Such a scenario would provide a distinct advantage and thus
the retention of the wrist joint in the theropods is not
surprising. The title of the sequel to "Jurassic Park" is
thus easy: "Jurassic Park II: The cuddle of the
Coelusaurs"!</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the flexible wrist joint may have
first appeared in theropod dinosaurs as an aid in grasping
and retaining prey and was secondarily co-opted by the
birds as a mechanism which allowed flight. It may well be
that not only were the theropod dinosaurs the ancestors of
birds, but that they are the only group which <b>could</b>
be the ancestor to modern birds.</p>

<p>However, the wrist of Archae does not appear to have the
flexibility to allow power flight.</p>

<h3>Shoulder Joint</h3>

<p>The shoulder joint is also important to modern birds
because, not only does it allow full adduction (wing
movement down - Fig. 3b), but also full abduction (wing
movement up - Fig. 3d)</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Fig. 3</b> (view head on)

       |     |                      \( )/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e. the wing can be drawn up over the back (try it and
see how difficult it is). This full range of movement is
important in allowing modern birds to power fly. It turns
out that the shoulder joint of Archae appears to be
intermediate in orientation between some coelurosaurs
(theropod dinosaurs e.g. <i>Deinonychus</i>) and birds (<a
href="#Jenkins1993">Jenkins 1993</a>) - just as one would
expect from a transitional form. However, whilst the
shoulder joint provided a substantial degree of arm (wing)
elevation, it is not sufficient to allow full abduction as
in modern birds. Thus the shoulder joint of Archae does not
appear to allow the full range of movement needed for power
flying.</p>

<h3><a id="muscle-mass" name="muscle-mass"></a>Muscle
mass</h3>

<p>In modern birds the flight muscles (the pectoralis)
comprise up to 35% of the weight of the animal (think of
all that juicy meat at the front end of a roast chicken or
turkey). It is this massive muscle mass which provides the
power needed for flapping powered flight and the ability to
take off from a standing start. Ruben (<a href=
"#Ruben1991">1991</a>) used a pectoralis muscle mass
estimate for Archae of approx. 9% of the body weight. This
is much lower than in modern birds, but assumed that the
muscle attached to the cartilaginous chest wall and not a
keel - since a keel is unknown on Archae. The keel is a
bony extension of the sternum for the attachment of excess
flight muscle in modern birds. If the muscles did attach to
the chest wall in Archae, the length of the pectoralis
muscles would have been too short to allow full abduction
(see "shoulder joint" above). However, the presence of a
small, cartilagenous (and thus not preserved) keel is not
out of the question. (Specimens of Archie from the
Solnhofen Limestone show no evidence of a sternum. However,
recent finds of Archie-like forms from China suggest that
Archae did in fact possess a sternum (J.M.V. Rayner,
University of Bristol, pers.comm.) Therefore, the 9% figure
is a minimum value. This value is well below that for
modern birds. Rubin suggested that the maximum power output
from the locomotor muscles of extant active reptiles is
twice that of birds and mammals, indicating that, if Archae
possessed a reptilian physiology, powered flight was a
possibility, even with such a small muscle mass. Speakman
(<a href="#Speakman1993">1993</a>) questioned this,
indicating that the power output of reptiles suggested by
Rubin was over-exaggerated, and that Archae would not have
had the power output to sustain power flight. Also Speakman
pointed out that the theoretical lower limit of pectoralis
muscle mass required for take-off from a standing start was
approx. 16% of body weight. Thus Archae was not capable of
power flight or take-off from a standing start.</p>

<p>The supracoracoideus is an important muscle in modern
birds because it is this muscle which elevates or abducts
the wing during power flight. Archae did not possess the
supracoracoideus arrangement found in modern birds (<a
href="#Ostrom1974">Ostrom 1974</a>). Thus Archae does not
appear to have had the muscle mass nor the muscle
arrangement to allow power flight, nor be able to take off
from a standing start.</p>

<p>It would appear that the structure and physiology of
Archae would mitigate against power flight. But, is this
the death knell for Archae's aerobatic abilities? Actually,
no. Notice the use of the phrase "power flight" in the
preceding discussion. Virtually all modern flying birds
power are capable of power flight. Power flight is
controlled, flapping flight at low speeds and the ability
to take off from a standing start. This type of flying
requires a large amount of muscle mass and is energetically
very expensive. Hence modern birds have a pectoralis muscle
mass which comprises approx. 20-35% of body mass. In order
to accommodate this extra mass, a keel has developed on the
sternum. In other evolutionary developments, flight
feathers have become more asymmetric to assist in power
flight, and the supracoracoideus muscle system took on the
function of assisting in the lifting or abduction of the
wing, since this is difficult at low flying speeds.</p>

<p>Power flight is to flying what the 4 minute mile is to
running. However, just as being unable to run a 4 minute
mile does not necessarily indicate that one is incapable of
running, being unable to power fly does not necessarily
indicate that Archae was incapable of flying. The
characters concerned with flight we see in modern birds are
derived, an adaptation to power flight, and thus their
absence (or underdevelopment) in Archae cannot be used to
suggest an inability to fly.</p>

<p>The structure of the wing of Archae suggests that it was
incapable of power, flapping flight at low speeds. However,
the amount of adduction and abduction, along with the
increased flexibility of the wrist compared with theropod
dinosaurs, suggests that some sort of flapping was
possible, enough to keep Archae airborn at normal cruising
speeds (approx. 7-9 ms^-1). Whilst the low pectoralis
muscle mass appears to preclude power flight and take off
from a standing start, it should be pointed out that some
flying birds do possess a muscle mass lower that the 16% by
weight lower limit. These include some grebes, who
compensate for the lack of muscle mass by having a long
running take-off (<a href="#Speakman1993">Speakman
1993</a>). Archae is well equipped with a terrestrial
locomotion apparatus. Thus it is possible that Archae could
circumvent this problem in the same manner as the
grebes.</p>

<p>Flying at normal cruising speeds requires much less
energy that power, flapping flight and thus needs less
muscle mass to sustain it. As an added bonus, at normal
cruising speeds the wing is elevated (abducted) in the
upstroke by aerodynamic forces (<a href=
"#Rayner1988">Rayner 1988</a>) - thus circumventing the
need for the supracoracoideus arrangement necessary for
power, flapping flight.</p>

<h2><a id="ancestry" name=
"ancestry"></a><i>Archaeopteryx's</i> Ancestry</h2>

<p>Apart from the theropod ancestry, there have been three
other suggested ancestral groups for Archae, the
Ornithopoda, the Pseudosuchia and the Sphenosuchidae.</p>

<p>The Ornithopod ancestry theory was based on the tasus
and pelvis in various dinosaurs which were supposed to
approach the condition found in birds. However, most of the
taxa used in the original theory in 1883-4 are now known to
be saurischian rather than ornithischian. Whilst there was
a tendency for the reduction of the hallux (big toe) in
some ornithischians, it was never apparently opposable as
it is in Archae. It was suggested that Archae had a pelvis
which was very ornithischian, however, recent work has
shown that this is an artifact of post mortem movement of
elements of the pelvic region and there is very little
similarity to the ornithischian pelvis. With this, the link
between ornithischians and Archae disappears and so it is
now thought that there is no link between them.</p>

<p>It was suggested that birds arose from an almost unknown
Middle or Late Triassic reptile group, the Sphenosuchidae
(<a href="#Walker1972">Walker 1972</a>, 1974), which also
gave rise to the crocodiles. The theory is based on a
single specimen of <i>Sphenosuchus</i>. However, in their
general configurations, neither the skull and jaws, nor the
scapulo-coracoid of <i>Sphenosuchus</i> is remotely
suggestive of affinities with Archae (<a href=
"#Ostrom1976">Ostrom 1976</a>). More recently, the main
proponent of the crocodile-bird hypothesis has stated that
the hypothesis "has become so tenuous that it is very
difficult to sustain." (<a href="#Walker1985">Walker
1985</a>, p. 133)</p>

<p>The pseudosuchian link was very much favoured earlier
this century. However this was, by and large, based on
Heilmann's reconstruction of the Berlin specimen, which has
since proven to be inaccurate. According to Ostrom (<a
href="#Ostrom1976">1976</a> p. 159):</p>

<blockquote>"There are very few anatomical resemblances
between <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and any pseudosuchian. In
fact, only in <i>one</i> feature does <i>any</i>
pseudosuchian resemble <i>Archaeopteryx</i> more closely
than does any theropod, this being the tibia to femur ratio
in <i>Scleromochlus</i>, <i>Lagosuchus</i> and
<i>Lagerpeton</i>, where the tibia is from 20% to 30%
longer than the femur. Amongst theropods, only in
struthiomimids, <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Microvenator</i>
and <i>Deinonychus</i> is the tibia longer than the femur
but by only 10% to 15%. In <i>all other features</i>, the
closest resemblance to the morphology preserved in
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> is found in coelurosaurian theropods."

<p>Some people like to claim that the finding of a fossil
bird from the Triassic of Texas (<i>Protavis</i>) proves
that Archae cannot be transitional between dinosaurs and
birds because <i>Protoavis</i> predates Archae by 75
million years. This is, of course, errant nonsense, mainly
because no one is claiming that Archae is <i>the</i>
transitional species between dinosaurs and birds, merely
that Archae represents a grade of organisation which the
proposed lineage went through to get from dinosaurs to
birds. Archae is, I'm sorry to say, out on a limb,
evolutionarily speaking. It represents a side branch,
useful for comparative purposes, but not in the thick of
things. So even if there were birds in the Triassic, that
fact would not diminish Archae's importance as an indicator
that "yes, birds could have evolved from dinosaurs."</p>

<p>However, notice the "if" in the previous sentence. There
are major problems with <i>Protoavis</i>. On the Chatterjee
(<a href="#Chatterjee1991">1991</a>) interpretation, Ostrom
(<a href="#Ostrom1991">1991</a>) has this to say [my
paraphrase]: The only published material from the fossil is
a monograph in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society of London. However, this only describes the head.
This is badly crushed and all the pieces have been
extracted from the matrix, rendering precise placement of
the pieces open to question. The description is done from
an avian viewpoint, with no counterview (e.g. is this a
dinosaur?) used. The skull is so badly crushed that
diagnostic features are not preserved. Therefore the
published material does not support the view that this is a
bird. Indeed a viewing of the fossil by Ostrom (in
admittedly less than ideal surroundings) showed that the
diagnostic features which could identify the fossil either
way are badly crushed and it is doubtful whether any
definitive statement could be supported by the fossil. It
may be a bird, it may not.</p>

<p>Please note that this questioning of <i>Protoavis</i> as
a bird is no "it can't be a bird because it predates
Archae" evilutionist backlash. As has been pointed out,
even if it is a bird, it does not detract from the
evolutionary importance of Archae.</p>

<h2><a id="conclusions" name=
"conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>

<p><i>Archaeopteryx</i> is a bird because it had feathers.
However, it retained many dinosaurian characters which are
not found in modern birds, whilst having certain characters
found in birds but not in dinosaurs. By virtue of this fact
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> represents an example of a group in
transition - a representative which, although on the
sidelines in the dinosaur to bird transition, an echo of
the actual event, still allows a brief glimpse into the
possible mechanism which brought about the evolution of the
birds and by its very existence shows that such a
transition is possible.</p>

<p>This came about as the result of a series of discussions
with Rich Trott, who was fighting the systematic misuse of
Archae by certain opponents of evolution, and still managed
to find the time to suggest many improvements to this post.
