        A group of people play in a FantasyFootball league on the Internet, where 
        they pick players from a variety of NFL football teams across the league 
        once a week to earn them points against other players within their group. 
        This group decides that while they are watching the Sunday and Monday 
        football games, they would also like to set up a private group on TV to 
        bet against each other for more real-time entertainment value. One member 
        of the group agrees to set up the group. They turn on their TV and goes 
        directly to the sports channel that will be hosting the game. They click 
        on the icon, which says &quot;bet now to win&quot; and opts for &quot;create 
        a private group&quot;. They add their friends from their buddy list. They 
        all receive notification when they turn on their TVs and join in. The 
        group spends the entire game making bets and posting messages to the group. 
        At the end of the game, many of the players click the &quot;email results 
        now&quot; button, which sends an email to their desired email account, 
        so they can print out of all the bets taken place along with the standings 
        of each member of the group. </font></p>
