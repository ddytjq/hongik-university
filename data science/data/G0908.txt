<A HREF="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html">Ned Wright's Javascript</A>.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It allows you to plug in a Hubble constant,  &Omega<sub>m</sub> which is actual density divided by critical density) and &Omega<sub>vac</sub> (the cosmological constant, a necessary repulsive force) into a complex equation which, fortunately, you don't have to solve because Ned Wright's Javascript solves it for you.   Finally, insert any reasonable value for the red shift and you get a readout which shows the age of the universe where we are, as well as the age of the universe at that red shift.

<font color=red>[Check <A HREF="homden4.html#density">this link</A> to Essay #4 if you want a little more information about &Omega<sub>m</sub> and &Omega<sub>vac</sub>.   What you need to know is explained in the first red copy you see, and if you scroll down the equivalent of about half a page (or half a screen), you'll see the generic assumption cosmologists make to get a "flat" universe these days.]

<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Whatever combination of parameters you select, you should come up with an age of the universe about 13 to 14 billion years old<strong>;</strong> the farther outside it is from this range, the more uncomfortable you should feel about <em>at least one</em> of the parameters in your input.   Stellar aging <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001MNRAS.327L..47F&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e113303">in this abstract</A> indicates a universe about 13 billion years old, while 
<A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001ApJ...563L..95K&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e113389">this reference</A> mentions that the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) suggests a universe pretty close to 14 billion years old.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It doesn't take you too long to see what the problem is <em>without</em> a cosmological constant in the conventional Friedmann "flat" model.   If you assume a critical density universe (where &Omega<sub>m</sub> = 1), you need to plug in a Hubble value of just 50 to get a universe <em>at least</em> 13 billion years old.   The problem is that Hubble's constant seems to be no lower than 60, and is more likely closer to 70.   So you have to use what many would consider a too low rate of expansion to get a universe with sufficient age, provided your initial assumption is a universe with critical density and no cosmological constant.
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Using slightly different terminology, <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...545L...1B&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e114504">Constraints on Cosmological Parameters from MAXIMA 1</A> by A. Balbi et al. shows a likely range of &Omega<sub>m</sub> (0.25 to 0.50) and &Omega<sub>vac</sub> (0.45 to 0.75).   Since it always helps to see if other researchers agree, <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001MNRAS.324..560D&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e122304">
this reference</A> by R. Durrer and B. Novosyadlij proposes similar parameters (Omega<sub>m</sub> = 0.37, &Omega<sub>vac</sub> = 0.69, for a total &Omega of 1.06), and the Introduction of <a href="http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/abs/gr-qc/0106033">Topological Lensing in Spherical Space</a> by Evelise Gaussman, Roland Lehoucq, Jean-Pierre Luminet, Jean-Philippe Uzan, and Jeffrey Weeks suggests the two &Omegas add up to 1.11.      
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>All three of these abstracts do not rule out the "flat" universe (where &Omega = 1, a model still included in the error bars), but indicate why it is necessary to carefully consider various positively curved models, including the Riemannian hypersphere, which I derived in Essay #3.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color=red>
[Note in the both abstracts above the subtle change in "lingo"<strong>:</strong> where Ned Wright is using &Omega<sub>vac</sub>, the researchers use &Omega<sub>&Lambda</sub> where &Lambda is the Greek letter for capital "lambda".   &Lambda is almost always used as a subscript for the "relative energy density" in the technical journals.]
</font>
</blockquote>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If you use the suggested range of values for &Omega<sub>m</sub> and &Omega<sub>vac</sub> (or &Omega<sub>&Lambda</sub>) and assume a Hubble parameter in the 60 to 75 km/sec/mpc range, you will find a variety of combinations that give you an age of the universe in the 13 to 14 billion year range.

Determining the Red Shift of the Minimum in Size and Luminosity</font></strong></center>
<pre>

</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There's something else I find interesting with <A HREF="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html">Ned Wright's Javascript</A>.
   Plug in "70" for the Bubble parameter, "1.00" for &Omega<sub>m</sub>, "1.25" for the red shift z, and then click on the "flat" icon (because the assumption for the moment is that we occupy a flat universe).   Then note that the angular size distance is 4.139 billion light years.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Now do this<strong>:</strong> change the red shift from 1.25 to 1.2.   The angular size distance shrinks just a tad to 4.137 billion light years.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Next change the red shift from 1.2 to 1.3, and you'll notice that the angular distance size is still 4.137 billion light years.   In other words, the object seems a little larger at z = 1.3 than it does at 1.25; it has actually passed through a minimum in apparent angular size at z = 1.25.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Many times the universe is depicted assuming we're at the north pole, with the singularity at the south pole.    This lets us know intuitively that objects ought to pass through a minimum, at the "equator".   Using (too simple) Euclidean geometry, one would think that objects would pass through such a minimum about halfway between here and the singularity.   But relativity moves this minimum much further than our first ballpark estimate would suggest.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Anyway no matter what parameters you use in Ned Wright's Javascript, you'll find there is red shift that corresponds to a maximum distance at which objects pass through a minimum in size.   If you use a higher red shift, you find that the distance <em>decreases</em>.   You'll also notice there's a fairly broad range in red shifts where the the maximum distance doesn't seem to change that much.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>This ought to make sense too, because if we were at the north pole and looked toward the south pole, there would be large region on either side of the "equator" where objects would not seem to change that much in size or luminosity.

Cosmological Assumptions Used in the Quasar Tables</font></strong></center>
<pre>

</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In <A HREF="qta.html">Essay #7</A> on quasars I worked up a variety of quasar tables and was most interested in looking at the quasar distribution in <em>relative</em> distance, that is, how do the quasars behave in distance increments of 1/100th of the total distance from here to the singularity (which increment also represents 1/100th of the "age" of the universe).   That led to an interesting question<strong>:</strong> just exactly <em>how much time</em> and <em>how much distance</em> does an increment of 0.01 represent?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Using Ned Wright's Javascript above and his "lingo", I decided to use a <strong><FONT COLOR=navy>
Hubble value of 70, &Omega<sub>m</sub> = 0.3, and &Omega<sub>vac</sub> = 0.7</font></strong>   The news section at his site indicates those are the values he's using and a survey of the literature seems to indicate these are pretty close to the standard values used these days.   
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>These three parameters give an age of the universe at 13.462 billion years and means that each 0.01 increment in the quasar tables represents 134.62 billion light years and therefore 134.62 billion years of time (and I see no reason why we can't round this off to "135").
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The value for Hubble's constant can vary from 70 km/sec/mpc by +/- 3 km/sec/mpc <strong>or</strong>  &Omega<sub>m</sub> can be off from the assumed value of 0.3 by +/- 0.05 <strong>or</strong> &Omega<sub>vac</sub> can be off by +/- 0.1 from the adopted value of 0.7 and the age of the universe will still be in the acceptable range of about 13 to 14 billion years.   The age of the universe depends <em>primarily</em> on the Hubble parameter.   So we have to be pretty close on that one -  with an error no larger than about 5% - but can incur a larger error on the other two estimates and still be in the right cosmic ballpark.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>These three adopted values permit <em>some</em> room for error and are probably the best estimates at the moment, or not <em>too</em> far from them (as of January, 2002).
