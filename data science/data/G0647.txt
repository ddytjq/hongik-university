<P>As astronomers peer ever deeper into outer space and <!g><A HREF="../physgloss/cosml-body.html">cosmologists</a>
extend their equations to encompass ever more of the universe,
as geneticists unravel the mysteries of our genes and evolutionary
biologists uncover more about the origins and development of life,
scientists are answering questions that once fell to theologians.
In this scientific age, we might well ask what role is there for
religion? And how might science and religion work together?</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>For physicist and theologian <!g><A HREF="../bio/bobr-body.html">Robert Russell</a>
- the director of the Berkeley-based Center for Theology and the
Natural Sciences - the two disciplines &quot;need each other&quot;.
Although scientists are answering a huge range of questions, Russell
notes that science also &quot;raises questions which are broader
than science can answer.&quot; These questions are usually philosophical
or moral in nature: Why is there a universe at all? Why do we
find mathematical order in the world around us? Why does science
itself make sense? Why is science of value? And how can we best
put our scientific knowledge to use? According to Russell these
questions require the input not only of scientists, but also of
philosophers, ethicists, and theologians.</P>

<P>On the other hand, Russell points out that in the modern scientific
age theologians and religious people cannot afford to ignore what
is going on in science. Christian philosopher <!g><A HREF="../bio/murph-body.html">Nancey Murphy</a>, of
Fuller Theological Seminary, explains that if religious world
views do not seem to be connected to the concrete universe that
science describes, then it is easy to dismiss them. Indeed the
separation of religion from science in the post-<!g><A HREF="../gengloss/enlight-body.html">Enlightenment</a>
era has done much to undermine religious belief in the Western
world. According to Murphy, in order for religions to maintain
the power of their moral teachings they must be seen to be in
harmony with the &quot;truths&quot; of science. In other words,
if you want people to believe what you have to say on moral issues,
Murphy suggests you need them to take your cognitive world picture
seriously - which means, she says, not contradicting the theories
of science.</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>But in looking to harmonize religious
and scientific world views, Jesuit priest and astronomer Father
<!g><A HREF="../bio/coyne-body.html">George Coyne</a> warns that one must be careful not to let either
side dominate the other. On the one hand Father Coyne notes that
&quot;my scientific investigation has always supported my belief
in God in a very real sense&quot;. As a Christian, Coyne believes
in the universe as in some sense a creation of God, hence, he
says, God must be reflected in that universe. But at the same
time he stresses that science cannot be used to prove the existence
of God, or as the basis of religious faith. As he explains, &quot;I
have never come to know God, to believe in God though doing science.
He is not the conclusion of some sort of process of my scientific
investigation.&quot; In the end, Father Coyne says, faith stands
outside science. Yet he notes that once you have faith then scientific
discoveries can be a wonderful way of affirming that faith, by
showing you the marvelous beauty and order in the universe.</P>
