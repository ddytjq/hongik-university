4,000 years of women in science!  Did you know that?  Women are, and always
have been, scientists.  This site lists over 125 names from our
scientific and technical past.  They are all women!  This site grew out
of the public talks given by Dr. Sethanne Howard, currently with the 
National Science Foundation.
