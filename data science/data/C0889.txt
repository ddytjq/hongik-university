<P><i>Got the idea? Peter Snow warms to the prospect of a holiday on ice</i></p></font>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">


<p><b>As it doesn't look like we're in for an Indian summer, why don't you just resign yourself to the fact that winter's on its way, dust off your snow boots, goggles and skis and head off somewhere really, really cold. And I don't mean Wycombe in Berkshire - where this year's British Artificial Ski Slope championships take place 4-5 November.</b></p>

<p>Nowadays the world's your ski-lift. Call it global frosting, but it seems to me that there's nowhere you can't '<b>bend zee knees</b>' if the ski bug's bitten. Check out the excellent <A HREF="http://www.1ski.com" TARGET="new">www.1ski.com</A> and you'll see exactly what I mean. </p>

<p>From <b>Australia to Kazakhstan</b>, every ski resort known to man is listed together with loads of information on how they rate for different types of skiers (novice to expert). They can even tell you how many ski lifts there are. More useful are the <b>thumbs-up and thumbs-down</b> icons awarded to each resort. </p>

<p>For example the lone Russian resort, which - surprise, surprise - offers <b>year-round skiing</b>, is given a thumbs-up for its vast expanse of mountain to explore off-piste, but a thumbs-down for its lack of marked runs. You're also told if a resort is 'family-friendly' or not, which I guess can be either a thumbs-up or thumbs-down depending on your point of view. Similarly, <A HREF="http://www.goski.com" TARGET="new">www.goski.com</A> gives details of over 2,000 ski resorts in 37 countries, including 700 resorts in the USA. It has a natty weather section entitled, 'It's snowing somewhere right now' which also features a handy wind chill conversion table.</p>

<p>At <A HREF="http://www.skiclub.co.uk" TARGET="new">www.skiclub.co.uk</A> as well as the usual 'snow reports', which give the avid skier a little more info than 'yes, there is some', you can get the latest news. For instance, from the end of October, Easyjet (<A HREF="http://www.easyjet.co.uk" TARGET="new">www.easyjet.co.uk</A>) is doubling its daily service to Geneva, a move especially aimed at skiers. There's also lots of holiday offers, all neatly categorised by level of skiing ability. For the more adventurous there's details on <b>snow safaris</b>, where you climb and ski in remote areas, and <b>heli-skiing</b>, where you are taken up and down mountains by helicopter. For the latter you are comfortingly told that avalanche bleepers are provided.</p>

<p>While you may still be recovering from the Sydney Olympics, it's worth your while checking out the skiing potential of Salt Lake City, Utah, which will be home to the Winter Olympics come February 2002. </P>

<p>The official site, <A HREF="http://www.slc2002.org" TARGET="new">www.slc2002.org</A>, may actually inspire you to take up some other winter sports. You may have thought that the luge was bone-rattling enough but these games will also see the revival of 'skeleton' where athletes race headfirst down the bob track. Lying on a very slim board, their chins are only centimetres from the ice. This death defying event was invented at the 1928 St Moritz games and last seen in 1948. You may also be surprised to learn that <b>snowboarding</b> is now an official Olympic event. For other US-based ski info, your best bet is <A HREF="http://www.hyperski.com" TARGET="new">www.hyperski.com</A>, an American online magazine for serious skiers and boarders.</P>
