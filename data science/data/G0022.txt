I hope you've read up on <a href="spacetime.html">spacetime diagrams</a>
and understand that bit about the singularity sometimes being a place and
sometimes a time and the inertial frame bit, and <a
href="penrose.html">Penrose diagrams</a> and
understand the whole wormhole thing.  Where to start?  You could inquire,
quite sensibly, about the insides a black hole.  The answer depends on the
what kind of black hole you had in mind.  <a href="static.html">Static
black holes</a> "just" have a singularity in the center.  <a
href="charged.html">Charged</a> and <a
href="rotating.html">rotating black holes</a> have another event horizon,
a singularity, and possibly much more.  Since they all have singularities,
perhaps I should start there, but I'm warning you that I only get to the
fun bit about getting to other universes at the very end (page down if you
can't stand the suspense).
<a name="singularity">
<h1>What's a Singularity?</h1>
Clever me hasn't quite mentioned what a singularity is, just that black
holes have one.  What is it?  Anything.  Everything.  Nothing.  Infinitly
curved spacetime.  All of these things could be the singularity.  The
whole problem is that in order to understand what happens just above and
in the singularity, you've got to have a good grasp of quantum mechanics.
Much to my regret I do not have a good grasp of quantum mechanics.  I
cannot explain <i>why</i> the things I'm going to tell you are true, I can
only repeat what I've heard and read.<img

width="200" height="200">
<p>
First and foremost of these is that the singularity is a "seething bed of 
probability."  What does this mean?  Well, from what I can tell, it means
that trying to say what's actually *inside* the singularity is just as bad
as trying to measure the exact location and velocity of an electron (which
cannot be done with any kind of reliability, according to Herr 
Heisenberg). Surely, one would think, it is possible to just poke one's
head in and check. Erm...not quite. There could be whole other
simultaneous universes inside, or a crystallized fractal-shaped tree, or
there could just be a little pink kitten with creme on its whiskers.
Confusing , yes.  Let it stand that the singularity is much like the early
universe: extremely energetic and also quite chaotic. That's real
chaos---the inability to say what's what---versus chaotic motion and
fractals.  That wasn't very satisfying.  Ah, well, you'll have to wait
until I take a quantum mechanics course!
<p>
<h1>A Run-through of the Singularities :</h1>
<h1>Static Singularity</h1>
<img src="../media/wormhole.gif"
align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" height="402">
The picture to the left describes the singularity of
a <a href="static.html">static black hole</a>.  What are those funny graph
pictures?  This is a 1-2 diagram---1 time dimension and two spatial
dimensions.  Okay, recall the <i>lines</i> of simultaneity? The surface of
these graphs describes a <i>plane</i> of simultaneity. This picture shows
the evolution of an eternal black hole, one that has existed from the
beginning of time.  The 1-2 diagrams are known as embedding diagrams, for
they take a slice of spacetime and embed it in the third dimension to show
how it warps. It takes a lot of heavy calculation to create them and make
such nice pictures as this one. <a 
href="breferences.html#sup7"><sup>7</sup></a> Trust me, for I tried to
draw them and failed miserably.
<p>
What does this picture mean?  A, B, C, D, and E are slices of spacetime,
you know that much.  This picture chronologically follows the creation of
a wormhole!  You know, a Star Trek thing that allows you to travel from
the Alpha quadrant to the Gamma quadrant and encounter the Founders and
wage war for a few seasons. Slice E shows spacetime beginning to pucker, D
shows the wormhole bridging the two universes, C shows the shows the
wormhole at its largest possible diameter, B shows the wormhole then
pinching off, and A shows the resulting eternal spacetime.
 A is the future singularity, the thing everyone falls into; and B is the
past singularity, the thing that theoretically spawned the universe.  See
how the bottom of the gravity well is so pointy?  That point is the
singularity.  But, you say, there apparently are two singularities.  Yes.
One for our universe, one for another.  This leads to slice B and D and C.
The singularities are gone and the spacetime is connected!  This would be
the actual wormhole.  Two universes or two places in one universe are
"touching" in the sense that it is possible to go from one to the other.
Incidentally, you'll notice that the embedding diagram looks a lot like a
dip or a well in spacetime. I'll use the term 'gravity well' to describe
the region of spacetime warped by the gravity generated by the presence of
matter.
<p>
This would be a great way to travel from place to place in the universe,
except it is terribly unstable.  The whole process of the wormhole forming
and then pinching off sounds like it takes a while.  Most astronomical
stuff takes a while.  Unfortunatly, the wormhole pinches off so quickly
that <i>not even light</i> can get through.  A static black hole simply
isn't meant for convenient space travel.  A charged black hole's
singularity looks like this in the sense that the singularity is pointy
and nasty, but it has the virtue of avoidability.
<p>
<a name="ringsingularity"><h1>Remember the Ring Singularity?</h1>
Yes, the singularity of a rotating black hole is different than that of a
static or charged black hole.  The Kerr geometry describes it as a ring,
whereas the other two are points.  As a result, it has some quirky
properties.  The oddest of which is not something I can prove to
you right now.  Take my word for it that nasty calculations done by a C.
T. Cunningham<a href="breferences.html#sup8"><sup>8</sup></a> have proven
that gravity around the ring singularity is <i>repulsive</i>.  Light
actually bounces away from it!  Things actually bounce off it!  Well,
that's not quite accurate.  It depends on your approach angle.
<p>
Remember how things were different along the equator of a rotating black
hole?  Well, it's the same thing, again.  Pretty much the only way to fall
into a ring singularity is to approach it on the equatorial plane.  All
other approach trajectories will be repelled with increasing strength the
closer the angle is to the axis of rotation. There is actually a third
photon sphere right near the singularity.  If light approaches nearly
parallel to the axis of rotation, the gravity and antigravity of the
singularity are balanced out; and the light traces out a funny-looking
path of constant distance (which in Kerr geometry is an ellipsoid---a
three dimensional oval).  This path sometimes leads the light into another
universe and back again.  Pretty sneaky, huh?
<p>
That's why looking at a ring singularity is so much cooler than the other
two singularities.  Seen from the axis of rotation, it is a circular
window with rings of different light.  The larger the angle between your
trajectory and the axis of rotation, the more oval that window becomes.
Seen from the equator, it is a sort of line-like thing glowing with only
one kind of light.  What you actually see in the window is pretty
complicated, so I'm going to keep it quite simple.  Basically, you see
three things: light from your own universe (from which you just came) that
has been bounching around the singularity, light from the singularity
itself (it is such an odd place!), and light from the so-called negative
space (however many other universes are visible from the black hole).  Why
does the singularity emit its own light?  It's a place where events don't
always follow a logical pattern.  Random particles are created and
destroyed in the area just around it.  That's why it would emit its own
light. At least that's what I've been told. Yes.
<p>
<h1>What about the Other Universes in the Negative Space?</h1>
Why am I not describing those?  According to one souce, it's possible to
peer in and see the light from 4 or 5 other universes and varying times.
I don't quite fully understand all the possibilities.  It's easier if you
look at that Penrose diagram of the black hole.  Theoretically, it goes
on infinitly.  You have access to an infinite number of universes from
inside such a black hole.  You could visit one, two, a few, or many!  You
could also weave in and out of the inner event horizon, peering at other
universes and not entering them.  That's why it's tough for me to give a
general description of what you see past the singularity.
<p>
<a name="tidal"><h1>Tidal Forces</h1>
Sounds like it involves water, doesn't it?  In a way tides are just a side
effect <img src="../media/Vert.jpg"
align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="80" height="112"> of the
namesake idea.  This all has to do with how matter behaves
in a gravitational field---and I don't just mean by falling down!  It's
easier to explain this with a thought experiment.  Imagine these two rocks
that are high above the earth and as far apart as a quarter of the earth's
radius. They're falling towards the planet.  As they fall, the bottom rock
is further down in the gravitational field, experiencing more acceleration
than the top rock.  Consequently, the bottom rock falls faster than the
top one, and they start to separate.
<br clear="right">
<p>
Now, imagine the two rocks high above the earth lined 
<img src="../media/Horiz.jpg"
align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="90" height="107"> up
horizontally and as far apart as a quarter of the earth's circumference.
The two rocks are both falling effectively towards the center of the earth
(except there're these pesky things the crust and the mantle in the way).
As they fall, the two rocks move horizontally towards the center of the
earth.  This makes them both move toward each other, since the center of
the earth is kinda between them (albeit quite below them, too).
<p>
What's this got to do with the force that ends up stretching you to
infinity when you fall into a black hole?  It all has to do with the
equivalence principle.  An inertial frame is just like a frame in freefall
on a local scale.  Why?  Think about something in freefall---remember
those silly physics homework questions about how much Suzy weighs as
measured on a scale in an elevator as it falls?  The answer is that her
weight is zero.  Normally, people are accelerating at 9.8 meters per
second upward, as a result of the force of the earth pushing on 'em.  When
an object is in freefall, that so-called normal force is gone, so the
total acceleration is zero.
<p>
What's the catch?  Well, this only works on a local basis.  It's
small-scale stuff.  When you fall into a black hole, you're in freefall.
You should be okay...except that the size of "local" rapidly decreases.
When "local" no longer covers your whole body, you start to deform just
like those rocks.  Along the radial direction your body gets stretched
apart (like the vertical rocks), and along the tangential direction (like
the horizontal rocks) your body gets squished together.  This eventually
becomes so bad that your body can't take the stress and...erm...well...it
painfully breaks apart.  Local keeps shrinking, smaller and
smaller, until it passes atomic size and goes to zero, as the
mathematicians would say.
<a name="blue"><h1>White Holes and Blue Sheets</h1>
Talking about black holes always involves lots of black, black, black with
maybe a little red thrown in the mix. In conjuction to hearing about black
holes, most people have heard the phrase 'white hole.' It is a confusing
phrase and is generally avoided by serious scientists, I've been told. I'm
not the most serious-minded person, so I'll give a once-through on the
whole white hole thing, just to clear the air and resolve any questions.
<p>
Black holes and white holes are, indeed, two sides of the same coin. In
fact that metaphor describes their relationship exactly. Whether something
is a black hole or a white hole depends on in what direction you are
looking. Stand outside of the outer event horizon and you are looking down
at a fine black hole. Stand inside the inner event horizon (cuz you can't
technically 'stand' between horizons cuz there are no static observers,
there) and look back where you came from and you'll see a fine white hole. 
You enter the black hole and leave the white hole at the same time. Here's
another metaphor: driving on a one-way street. When you look behind you,
you see an event horizon of a white hole; when you look ahead of you, you
see an event horizon of a black hole. As per the metaphor, you cannot back
up into the white hole. Just as the static singularity is always in the
future, the white hole is always in the past; any attempt to back into the
white hole is countered by insurmountable resistance.
<p>
Great, now you know about white holes. The blue sheet is pretty much the
same thing. In fact you could even look on it (not entirely accuratly) as
being the 'event horizon' of the white hole ... sort of. As stuff falls
further into the gravity well of the black hole, it is losing
gravitational potential energy. Where does that energy go, you ask? It
translates into kinetic energy! (The velocity of the matter that falls in
increases and the whole effect is commonly called the acceleration due to
gravity.) Light also feels the effect of gravity, but since it can't
really speed up (light traveling in a vacuum being the constant rate of
3x10<sup>8</sup> and all), its frequency increases: microwaves to visible
light to gamma rays (the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation...you
get the point). This process is called blue shifting, akin to red
shifting, about which you've no doubt already read.
<p>
So, about the blue sheet, already! I just described what happens to a
singular light ray falling into the black hole. Imagine that happening to
<i>all</i> of the light falling into the black hole. The wave of
high-energy radiation pouring across the black hole's horizons is known as
the blue sheet (y'know, <b>sheet</b> of energy, <b>blue</b> shifting...it
makes sense). The blue sheet effect is solely from the energy boost of the
outer event horizon, just from falling into the black hole's gravity well.
You see how the blue sheet kinda is the white hole? A massive outpouring
of high energy <i>stuff</i>? It's one of the major hazards of traveling in
a black hole (aside from the black hole, itself, that is).
<p>
<a name="charged"><a name="chargedsigularity"><h1>Charged or Rotating
Singularities: how to get from Universe A to Universe B in one piece</h1>
I've been teasing you about being able to go from universe to universe
using <a href="charged.html">charged</a> or <a
href="rotating.html">rotating</a> black holes. <img
src="../media/penrose2.gif"
align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" height="313"> To the
right is the Penrose diagram
for a charged or rotating black hole.  One of the first things I want to
point out is the nature of the singualrity.  I told you earlier that the
singularity was a place in time; but that was only for the static black
hole!  See here, the singularity is a definite place, and places can be
avoided as long as you don't have to go the speed of light to do it.
<p>
This is the road map for jumping from one universe to another. Say that
purple worldline is me in my 2085 Ford Tempo rocket (with mismatching red
paint). I want to travel somewhere using the super-massive rotating black
hole right in front of me. I take the time to perch at the lip of the
gravity well and at a small angle to one of the poles of the axis of
rotation of the black hole. (My Tempo is impossibly well-shielded against
radiation.) Armed with the might of relativity (and some auto insurance),
I dip the nose of my Tempo towards the outer event horizon and dive into
the 'well. As I fall, I'm trading gravitational potential energy for
kinetic energy, and I end up going quite fast as I cross the outer event
horizon. The instant I reach R<sub>s</sub>, my engines cut off just as I
preprogramed them to do.
<p>
This particular galactic black hole is rotating very quickly, so I very
quickly cross the inner event horizon. Since the two event horizons are
nearly on top of one another and since I cut my engines before I entered
the realm between them, I do not experience any tidal unpleasantness. A
very curious thing happens when I cross the outer event horizon. The
singularity becomes an unavoidable place in time---it becomes my
future---as the time axis and the space axis of my spacetime diagram
<i>exchange places</i>. As I cross the inner event horizon, time and space
resume their normal axes on my spacetime diagram, and the singularity
becomes a place in space.
<p>
I should remind you that I'm rocketing along at a speed close to light. I
blaze across the inner event horizon and shoot right through the center of
the ring singularity. Oooh, confusing statement. The singularity appears
to me as a round window. If the singularity emits any light on its own, I
would see that as the frame of the window. Inside that window...is
reminescent of what you see when you reflect one mirror into another: a
hallway of mirrors arching into infinity. The smaller the angle between my
approach and the axis of rotation, the more mirrors I see. What I see in
the window of the singularity is the same; but, instead of mirrors, I see
an infinite number of locations.
<p>
There is only one restriction on where I may go with a rotating black
hole: to enter a black hole means to leave a black hole. Black holes are
rather like subway terminals in that sense; if you walk down the stairs to
take a train, you've got to walk back up the stairs when you exit. You can
only exit at locations with those stairs. You could not use a black hole
to pop out right next to earth, 1999, because there are no black holes
right next to earth right now.
<p>
I wizz through the very center of the window, nearly orthogonal to
(perpendicular to) the window (nearly because I approached nearly
parallel to the axis of rotation. I recross both event horizons, one after
the other, and leave the black hole at a speed close to that of light. I
gained all my speed entering the gravitational well, now I lose it all
leaving the well. I coast away from the black hole's gravity well at the
same speed I entered, the mirror-image of my worldline when I entered the
'well---which kinda means I end up perched at the lip of the 'well, again,
with the option to fall back in or to leave and explore.
<p>
This universe-jumping is a fun thing to think about, but I always get edgy
when considering the idea of innocently wandering into a <i>whole
different universe</i>. I mean, the only things that define our universe
are our so-called laws of physics.  The speed of light in a vaccum is
3x10<sup>8</sup>. Electrons have such and such weight. Subatomic particles
interact in a certain way. In another universe, the numbers for these laws
might differ somewhat---or the laws could be completely different! Recall
all that dust and gas falling into the black hole as innocent little me
attempts to leave the gravity well? Suppose the universe I just entered is
one where <i>antimatter</i> is the dominant type of matter---and here's
little <i>matter</i> me. Imagine my surprise as a tiny clump of
anti-hydrogen atoms wisps against my Tempo's fender. Boom! Tremendous
explosion and lots of energy released, and that's the end of my traveling
days.
<p>
The other problem is that this situation is <i>completely</i> theoretical.
The Kerr solution is very <i>unstable</i>. The mere approach of a rocket
to the outer event horizon (let alone one diving across said horizon),
might destabalize the black hole and make it fatal for the rocket
attempting to travel through it. Get that? It's <b>not possible</b>. I'm
sorry (cuz it sounds like a fun way to explore), but that's the way thing
work.
