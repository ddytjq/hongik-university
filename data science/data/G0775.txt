Abstract
<p>
We have built a sample of 17 low-mass elliptical 
and elliptical-like galaxies with accurate photometric
and spectroscopic data. This sample, covering a wide range in
surface brightness, is in or near the low-mass extension of
the Fundamental Plane defined by bright ellipticals, but
shows a scatter which cannot be accounted for by measurement
errors and which is thus probably due to a large variety of
internal structures. Extending the analysis to globular clusters
and dwarf spheroidals, we find that they are also near or
within the Fundamental Plane, except the two dwarfs suspected
of having a high M/L. The range thus covered is 20 in absolute 
magnitude. These results suggest that the Fundamental Plane is a robust
representation of the Virial Theorem, valid for ellipticals and the
other types of pressure-supported stellar systems as well. It also
indicates that the standard parameter relations are little sensitive
to specific formation processes, local environment and structural details, 
that may have an effect at a subtler level.
