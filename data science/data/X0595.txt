<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">[JUL-2001] Here is a short guideline to
contemporary LD airfoiling, to be used for boomerangs of the MegaQuirl,
Voyager, Buzz Whip, Backdraft, etc. type.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we think about what LD booms are supposed
to do, i.e. go out far and come all the way back, we can identify two airfoil
characteristics:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1. low lift</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2. low drag</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The boom must have a little bit more lift
than required to keep it in the air. Because of the small forces and moments,
inertia dominates the motion and the boom will go out far. The boomerang
must be launched almost flat, so that the small lift force may counteract
the weight of the boom.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of utmost importance is low drag to maximize
the conservation of energy, which the boom needs to come back to the thrower
eventually.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#003300" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#003300"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here
is an airfoil, not too aggressive, for you to start with: I use it on the
<a href="http://www.baggressive.com/plans/plans.htm#off">Offspring</a>,
which is not a top performer, but a steady boomerang with range 100-120
m. Compared to airfoils of shorter flying boomerangs, e.g. booms for Aussie
Round, the leading and trailing edges are more pointed, reducing thereby
lift and drag. An important feature is the undercut, meaning material is
removed from underneath the trailing edge, which reduces lift dramatically.
Be careful with undercuts - too much and your boom will just fly straight
out and won't return.&nbsp;</font></td>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#003300"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Booms
with airfoils like the one shown above (Offspring) fly considerably far,
while still being quite forgiving and stable in flight. For throws going
out much farther, the airfoils need to be more AGGRESSiVE. The <a href="http://www.baggressive.com/plans/plans.htm#s14">Backdraft</a>is
my competition boom with a distance 120-170m. Compared to the previously
shown airfoils, the faces are carved much further into the wing, with smooth
transitions. Also, the leading edge is rather pointed. These features let
the boom travel out much farther, but also render it less stable and prone
to crashing on the way back. You have to give the boomerang as much forward
velocity and rotation as possible to keep it in stable flight.&nbsp;</font></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#003300"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here
is the airfoil Manuel Sch&uuml;tz uses for his <a href="http://www.baggressive.com/plans/plans.htm#voy">Voyagers</a>.
It seems less aggressive than the Backdraft airfoil. But maybe he showed
here a bit of a conservative airfoil, not his most aggressive one. Anyway,
we can see that the undercut reaches up to half the material thickness,
giving very low lift.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A special feature Manuel introduced is
the concave trailing edge. He has booms with concave carving only on the
top, and such where both sides are shaped concave. Manuel points out that
this brings about a further reduction in drag, and judging from flights
I have seen of Manuel's boomerangs, it appears that the ones with the concave
trailing edge return with higher velocity.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclustion, it can be said that in
order to attain a maximum distance, you have to go to the boundary of the
stable to the unstable flight regime. The last bit of tweaking to approach
this limit may be effectively achieved by tuning. Reducing drag is of primary
importance. So use the thinnest material available that is still stiff
and strong enough to withstand your throw without getting deformed or warped.</font>
