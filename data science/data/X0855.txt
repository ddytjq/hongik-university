<p align="left"> Here is some background on the entry of disc sports
 in the 2001 World Games in Akita, Japan. The opportunity to present
 disc sports as a medal sport in the World Games is the culmination
  of a relatively long process that began with the establishment of the World Flying Disc Federation
in 1985 and its subsequent acceptance into the General
Association of International Sports and the International World
Games Association. The drive for participation of disc sports in
the World Games has been tirelessly spearheaded by WFDF Board
member, Prof. Fumio Morooka of Japan. Demonstration activities
were provided at the last World Games in Finland along with a
continuing political effort to secure a position in the Akita
Games. Over the last year, the effort has intensified a great
deal as the IWGA narrowed down the number of new candidates for
medal participation in the Akita Games. Being a member
association of IWGA does not by any means guarantee participation
in the World Games. The process of detailing the potential
participation of disc sports in the Games with IWGA was very
demanding for several reasons. For one, of course, many of the
decision makers have very little firsthand knowledge of disc
sports. In particular, the breadth of our sports was a great
surprise to most IWGA staff. The other major challenge was the
very specific and limiting conditions of participation that are
set for all World Games sports. Over the years, many of us on the
WFDF Board have done a great deal of event formatting, but this
was by far the most challenging set of circumstances that we had
ever encountered. To solve this challenge, we identified several
basic goals to drive this process and decision. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
We needed to design a participation format that... <br>
1. Followed the mandates of the IWGA. <br>
2. Met the specific needs of the IWGA organizing committee for
the Akita games. <br>
3. We know that we can execute with high quality. <br>
4. Will favorably display the breadth and vigor of disc sports. <br>
5&nbsp;Will be attractive to players who are candidates to
participate. <br>
6. Could be accepted and supported by the
various disc event organizations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With so many restrictions and considerations involved, we
realized that what was eventually settled on would certainly fall
short of each sport&#146;s definition of an ideal &quot;world
championship&quot; competition. &nbsp; It is worth noting
however, that the same is true for many other well-established
sports. That is, the World Championship of any particular event
is certainly a better competitive format than their particular
Olympic championship. This is not so obvious to our sport because
we&#146;re so new to this all. The final consideration of course
is that we are obligated to strike a grand compromise for this
first world-level opportunity. Also, we believe that we have an
obligation to represent our games and players as broadly as is
practical in this first, and very important opportunity.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In our early submissions to the committee, we offered three
options that included a wide range of the disc sports and
disciplines and larger numbers of participants than we really
expected to be available. The feedback from that submission got
us an even more detailed set of guidelines. They encouraged a
concentration on the two most popular games, ultimate and golf.
We were given a total of ninety participants with six nations to
be represented in each sport. Given that scenario, the Board put
the question out to the ultimate and golf committees of WFDF for
detailed consideration. After considerable discussion and
analysis, the committee proposals came back to the Board for
approval. The Board made a number of adjustments and formally
approved the following procedure:<br>
<br>
Summary of WFDF Ultimate Event at the World Games in 2001<br>
<br>
As agreed with the IWGA, there will be six nations invited to
send<br>
Ultimate teams to the 2001 World Games. One of those invited will
be<br>
Japan, the host nation. The other five nations will be determined
by the<br>
results of WUC 2000.<br>
<br>
WG invitations will be based on the combined results of each
country's top<br>
three finishes in the six divisions of competition<br>
(Open/Women/Coed/Masters/Junior Open/ Junior Women).<br>
Because the competition in Akita will be
Coed,<br> a country must have a team entered in the coed division to
be<br>
considered for an invitation. Scoring within each division will
be<br>
determined by the number of teams entered in the division. If 20
teams are<br>
entered it will be worth 20 points to win, 19 for second and so
on down to<br>
1 point for 20th place. Japan's finishes will, for the sake of
point<br>
distribution, be treated as any other team. If two or more
countries are<br>
tied for the last invitation position, a tiebreak procedure will
be used<br>
which will then consider the country's finish in the fourth, fifth and
then sixth<br>
divisions if necessary. Invited countries must formally accept
their WG<br>
invitation by November 31st, 2000 or their spots will be given to
the next<br>
placing WUC countries.<br>
<br>
The National Association for each country chosen shall then be
responsible<br>
for selecting a Coed team to represent their country.<br>
<br>
Games will be played on regulation-size fields, under the rules
of<br>
Ultimate as established by WFDF for that year with the following<br>
exceptions:<br>
<br>
1. Rosters will be limited to 10 players.<br>
2. Games will be played 6 on 6, with 3 men and 3 women per team.<br>
3. Games will be played in two 45 minute halves.<br>
4. The end of each half will be called at the first score after
time has<br>
elapsed.<br>
5. A team that cannot field 3 men and 3 women for any point will
forfeit<br>
that game.<br>
<br>
The format will be round robin with a semifinal and final. Each
team will<br>
play either two or three games on successive days with a
semifinal (1v4,<br>
2v3) and final on the day following.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary of WFDF Disc Golf Event at the World Games in 2001<br>
<br>
As agreed with the IWGA, there will be six nations invited to
send<br>
a male and a female player to the 2001 World Games. One of those
invited <br>
will be Japan, the host nation. The other five nations will be
determined<br>
by the results of PDGA Pro Worlds 2000 in Michigan.<br>
<br>
WG national invitations will be based on the combined results of
each <br>
nation's top two point scorers in the Open and one top point
scorer in the <br>
Women's divisions of play. Points will be awarded as follows:<br>
<br>
- Scoring within the Open division will be determined by the
number of <br>
players entered in the division. If 350 players are entered it
will be <br>
worth 350 points to win, 349 for second and so on down to 1 point
for 350th <br>
place. Japanese players' finishes will, for the sake of point<br>
distribution, be treated as any other players'. <br>
<br>
- Scoring in the Women's division will be the same system as in
the Open <br>
with the addition of a multiplier to give each division equal
point value. <br>
Therefore, if there are 350 Open players and 50 Women's players,
the point <br>
multiplication factor will be 7. The winner of the Women's
division will <br>
get 50x7=350 points, just as the Open winner will. The 5th place
women will <br>
get 46x7=322 points, which is proportional to the points earned
by the<br>
Open player who beat the same percentage of the Open field.<br>
<br>
- Nations may enter as many players as are able to qualify in
each of the <br>
divisions, but only the two top scorers in the Open and the top
Women's<br>
scorer will be counted. If two or more countries are tied for the
last<br>
invitation position, a tiebreak procedure will be used which will
award<br>
the position to the country which has the higher scoring total
for their<br>
top man and women combined.<br>
<br>
-Invited countries must formally accept their WG invitation by
November <br>
31st, 2000 or their spots will be given to the next placing
countries.<br>
<br>
The National Association for each country chosen shall then be
responsible<br>
for selecting the male and female players to represent its
country in Akita <br>
at the World Games.<br>
<br>
At the World Games, the competition be played under the rules of<br>
disc golf as established by WFDF for that year. The format for
both the <br>
men's and women's divisions will be as follows:<br>
<br>
Preliminary Round:<br>
<br>
Round-Robin Match Play. Each player will play a nine-hole match
against <br>
each other player in the division (5 matches). Based on the
won/lost records <br>
of that round, the players will advance to a final round. If a
tiebreak is <br>
needed, the number of holes that each player won will be
considered.<br>
<br>
Final Round:<br>
<br>
The player finishing first in the preliminary round robin will
play an<br>
18 hole match against the player who finished second. The winner
will be <br>
declared the champion. The third finishing player from the round
robin will <br>
play the fourth finishing for the third position. The fifth
finishing <br>
player from the round robin will play the sixth finishing for the
fifth<br>
position. <br>
<br>
Summary&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This process involved many difficult decisions. In particular,
the Board and the Ultimate Committee realized that the choice of
coed play would be controversial. However, given the limitation
of one division only, the coed option presented itself as the
only feasible option. Given the selection process, we are
confident that the elite teams of men and women who will be
chosen for the event will provide an extremely high level of
ultimate play.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In addition to the format and selection process, there are
obviously many more details to be worked out. For instance, we
are now at a level of sport where there is routine drug testing.
Therefore, players who accept the invitation to play will be
under the same constraints as those faced by Olympic athletes. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps the most important aspect of this great opportunity for
disc sports is the fact that it is only a beginning. We realize
that there are freestylers, distance throwers, ddc or guts
players and others who will be disappointed that their disc sport
is not specifically represented in Akita. However, if we are able
to carry off this initial participation effectively, we are
certain that this will lead to even more international
opportunities for all disc sports. We look forward to working
with all of the national associations and their players to make
this aspiration a reality. <br>
