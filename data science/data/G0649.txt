    29, 1999:</B> <FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>amma Ray Bursts have puzzled
    scientists for over 30 years, since their discovery in 1967.
    This week's news of the identification of an optical counterpart
    to a burst as it was occurring is only the latest in a three-decade
    search for understanding of these enigmatic objects. Three decades
    of research have allowed scientists to finally answer the question
    <I>&quot;Where are the Gamma-Ray Bursts?&quot;</I>, and can now
    move on to answer the question <I>&quot;What causes them?&quot;</I>
    Recent discoveries in this field by a collection of international
    astronomers have demonstrated that these bursts are from the
    most remote parts of the universe, releasing perhaps as much
    energy in 10 seconds as the Sun emits in its entire 10-billion-year
    lifetime. Yet scientists are still baffled in many respects when
    it comes to answering the question &quot;What could cause something
    like this?&quot;</TD>

    <H3>A brief history...</H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>amma-ray bursts (GRBs for short) are
    brief flashes of high-energy radiation that appear on average
    about once a day at an unpredictable time from unpredictable
    directions in the sky. Since their discovery (by accident) in
    the late 1960's, several thousand bursts have been detected,
    most of them with BATSE, the Burst and Transient Source Experiment,
    on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Their distribution
    on the sky is completely uniform. In particular, they do not
    appear to come from the Milky Way. So where do they come from?
    This is the question that had kept astronomers busy for several
    decades, with no apparent resolution in sight.</TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he combined angular and brightness
    distributions of bursts eliminates the possibility that GRBs
    come from the disk of the Milky Way, and left astronomers with
    a choice between one of two possibilities:<BR CLEAR="ALL"></P>

    <UL>
      <LI>GRBs originate either in a very large spherical halo (or
      corona) around the Galaxy, or
      <LI>They come from the far depths of the Universe, billions of
      light years away from us.
    </UL>

    <P>The galactic halo would have to be very big, about a million
    light years across, which is much bigger than the diameter of
    the known Milky Way system (which is less than a hundred thousand
    light years), much less the halo that the Milky Way is known
    to have. The very large halo size is required to avoid an asymmetry
    in the GRB sky distribution caused by the fact that the Earth
    is offset from the center of the Galaxy, by about 25,000 light
    years.</P>

    <P>In the case of the other distance scale (referred to by astronomers
    as &quot;cosmological&quot;) it is the smoothness of the GRB
    sky distribution that tells us that their distances must exceed
    the length scales over which the distribution of matter appears
    clumpy, i.e., larger than clusters and superclusters of galaxies,
    and the voids between them.</TD>

    bursts in the late 1960's, and the launch of the BATSE&nbsp;experiment
    in 1991, most astronomers were convinced that bursts originated
    in our own Galaxy, on or near objects called neutron stars. Our
    Milky Way Galaxy contains <I>many</I> neutron stars, objects
    as massive as the Sun (about 300,000 times the mass of the Earth)
    but no bigger than about 10 kilometers in diameter. Their tremendous
    gravitational field and magnetic field made them an ideal source
    for the gamma-ray bursts.</TD>

    was believed that with BATSE's increased sensitivity, we would
    be able to see the faint gamma-ray bursts map out the Milky Way
    on the sky, the same way the stars appear to do so when you get
    away from the city lights and can see fainter objects.</P>

    <P>This concept is demonstrated in the accompanying figure. At
    the top, we see a schematic of our Galaxy's disk, with the Earth
    and BATSE located at the star. If we were not able to see very
    far out into space, symbolized by the first circle, we have the
    situation shown in the first set of plots. We see bursts in every
    direction equally. At the same time, we see there is no detectable
    edge and the brightness distribution of bursts follows a special
    curve indicating homogeneity. This is because our small inner
    circle is, to first order, filled uniformly with bursts.</TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>his appealing idea was confronted
    with reality in 1992, when it became clear from BATSE observations
    that GRBs are distributed uniformly on the sky, without a concentration
    to the plane of the Milky Way, or towards its center or in other
    clumps of or concentrations. In fact, the distribution is almost
    perfectly random.</P>

    <P>By itself, the angular distribution could lead one to argue
    that perhaps we see the bursts coming from quite nearby, from
    distances small compared to the thickness of the disk of the
    Milky Way. However, this would imply, as we saw above, that in
    no direction do we start to see the edge of the GRB distribution,
    or in this case, the edge of the Milky Way disk. Such an edge
    would reveal itself in the distribution of <I>brightnesses</I>
    of bursts, which would show a deficit of faint bursts.</P>

    <P>But this is contradicted by the observed brightness distribution
    of GRBs, which shows a distinct dearth of very weak GRBs: it
    is as though in all directions we do see that edge.</TD>

    <P>At such large distances the effect of the expansion of the
    Universe becomes noticeable. An important effect of this expansion
    is the redshift of light (and gamma rays) and the apparent slowing
    down of clocks, both of which would cause a change in the brightness
    distribution very similar to what BATSE&nbsp;actually observes.
    Scientists have looked at the bursts for these cosmological effects,
    and some have reported seeing time dilation (weak bursts, which
    are presumably farther away, are, on average, longer than the
    strong, nearby bursts) and others report energy shifting, where
    the distribution of gamma-rays in faint bursts appears shifted
    to lower energies compared to strong bursts. In general the BATSE&nbsp;data
    seemed to be hinting at a cosmological origin, but it couldn't
    be proved more directly.</P>

    <P>The key to nailing the cosmological hypothesis seemed to hinge
    on the ability to find a counterpart to a burst in a region of
    the spectrum outside of the gamma-rays. These counterparts would
    have the positional accuracies to link the GRB, for instance,
    to a faint galaxy, or allow the measurement of a redshift from
    an optical spectrum. Conversely, these would not be seen if GRBs
    came from a big galactic halo.</P>

    <H3>At last, a clue!!!</H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>inding such counterparts has recently
    become possible with the detection of GRBs with the Wide Field
    Camera (WFC) on board of the Italian-Dutch X-ray satellite BeppoSAX,
    which can pinpoint a GRB on the sky to within a circle with a
    diameter of 6 arcminutes (20 percent of the diameter of the full
    moon), and not only that, but can provide that position within
    a matter of hours, much faster than was possible before. This
    error box, if known sufficiently rapidly, is small enough that
    optical and radio telescopes can be used to search it for the
    presence of transient emission that may be connected with the
    GRB.</P>

    <P>This WFC is sensitive to X rays, and can view a 40 by 40 degrees
    field of view, within which it can locate X-ray sources with
    several arcminute accuracy.</P>

    <P>To know whether or not a GRB occurred in the field of view
    a Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) on BeppoSAX is employed, whose
    data are searched for GRBs every satellite orbit of 1.5 hours.
    When a GRB is found the WFC data are searched, and an accurate
    position can be determined, which is then quickly dispatched
    to astronomers around the world.</P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he first time this worked out successfully
    was on February 28, 1997 when a GRB was detected coming from
    the constellation Orion. Within 21 hours after this burst a team
    of astronomers from the University of Alabama in Huntsville and
    the University of Amsterdam used the 4.2 meter William Herschel
    Telescope on La Palma (one of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic
    Ocean, West of the North Africa) to make images of the BeppoSAX
    GRB location. They did the same about a week later. A comparison
    of these images immediately revealed one star that was present
    on February 28, which had disappeared a week later.</TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the meantime the Beppo SAX astronomers
    had used a more precise X-ray instrument on their satellite to
    also observe the GRB location in detail, and they found that
    it contained a weak decaying X-ray source, with a position (accurate
    to somewhat less than an arcminute) that coincided with that
    of the optical star that disappeared. Clearly, the X-ray and
    optical afterglow of a GRB had been detected for the first time.
    Further conformation that the decaying X-ray and optical signals
    came from one and the same source was obtained from X-ray images
    taken with the ROSAT satellite, which located the X-ray afterglow
    with an accuracy of some 10 arcseconds: it still coincided with
    the optical afterglow.</P>

    <P>As soon as the disappearing optical afterglow was discovered,
    very deep optical images were made of it with the ESO New Technology
    Telescope and the Keck Telescope, which showed that at the location
    of the optical transient there was a very weak object that looked
    slightly extended, quite possibly a weak galaxy.</P>

    <P>In a matter of weeks two observations were made with the Hubble
    Space Telescope, which showed that the fading optical transient
    consists of a point source (its fading between two HST observations
    shows it is the GRB counterpart) and an extended source ('fuzz')
    at whose edge it appears to be located. Although they don't constitute
    solid proof, these observations naturally fit the idea that the
    GRB of February 28, 1997 went off in a faraway faint galaxy (the
    fuzz).</TD>

    <H3>And Another!!!</H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he next major step forward occurred
    with a burst that was observed with the WFC on May 8, 1997. A
    faint optical variable star was detected at the GRB location
    by H. Bond of the STScI, using a 36 inch telescope at Kitt Peak
    National Observatory. A spectrum of this star taken by M. Metzger
    of Caltech and his collaborators with the Keck telescope showed
    that the presence of absorption lines, which are redshifted by
    0.83 (i.e., their wavelengths are 1.83 times their value measured
    in the laboratory). The case for the long distance scale appears
    now to be settled.</P>

    <P>Finally, for this GRB of May 8, D. Frail of the National Radio
    Astronomical Observatory discovered the first radio emission
    associated with any GRB.</P>

    <H3>And Now This!!!</H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT>ntil this week, astronomers had no
    idea how bright the optical emission might be during the actual
    time the burst was occurring. However, capturing that emission
    - if there actually was any - remained a high priority in the
    scientific community. In order to determine the gamma-ray burst
    location more quickly, a team of scientists, led by Dr. Scott
    Barthelmy at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, implemented
    the Gamma-ray burst Coordinates Network (GCN). This system automatically
    intercepts BATSE data at Goddard, calculates a rough gamma-ray
    burst position, and within seconds distributes the location over
    the Internet to eager observers around the world.</P>

    <P>Due to the challenges of determining the burst position in
    the sky, previous observations of visible light from gamma-ray
    bursts have all been made hours after the burst had ended. The
    light by that time was so dim it could only be detected by the
    world's largest telescopes. But thanks to GCN's rapid response
    time, the ROTSE-I telephoto camera array in Los Alamos, N.M.
    was able to watch a gamma-ray burst as it occurred. Dr. Carl
    Akerlof of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, along with
    several colleagues, designed ROTSE to point quickly to a gamma-ray
    burst location after receiving GCN data. ROTSE uses four telephoto
    lenses and charge-coupled devices (CCDs) on an automated pointing
    system, to image a piece of sky 16.5 degrees across as fast as
    every 8 seconds.</P>

    <P>ROTSE received a GCN location 4 seconds after the burst was
    identified by BATSE, and was able to observe the gamma-ray burst
    a mere 22 seconds after it had begun. At its brightest, the burst
    reached an apparent magnitude of 8.9, approximately 15 times
    dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye.</TD>

    <P>Astronomers are planning further observations to learn more
    about these mysterious gamma-ray bursts. To check on the possibility
    of lensing, BATSE scientists at NASA/Marshall are monitoring
    their data for other gamma-ray bursts coming from the same location
    in the sky. In addition, once the optical light has faded sufficiently,
    astronomers will use the world's most sensitive telescopes, including
    NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, to try to identify any galaxies
    lying near the gamma-ray burst.</P>

    <P>Never before have scientists been able to watch the visible
    light during a gamma-ray burst. Ever since the bursts were first
    discovered in 1967, scientists have been eager to gather more
    data about these elusive, cataclysmic explosions. Now, thanks
    to this collaboration between teams of international astronomers
    made possible by the communication capabilities of the Internet,
    scientists can learn more than they ever have before.</P>

    <P>&quot;This discovery demonstrates the power of multiple spacecraft
    and ground-based instruments working together via the Internet
    to solve some of the greatest mysteries in astrophysics,&quot;
    commented Dr. Gerald Fishman, Principal Investigator of the BATSE
    experiment</P>

    <P>Thanks to this type of co-operation, scientists have now made
    an immense leap toward solving the enigma of gamma-ray bursts.</TD>
