<h3>Gram-Negative Coccobacilli May Pose a Biosafety Risk to Laboratory Staff </h3>
<a href="mailto:ml@bugs.uah.ualberta.ca">Marguerite Lovgren MLT, ART</a>

<p>Routine culture and susceptibility testing in the clinical microbiology laboratory most commonly involves manipulation of bacteria classified as Risk Group II (1). This means that they present only a moderate risk to the technologist and minimal risk to the community. Laboratory exposure rarely leads to infection and treatment is available. Routine identification and susceptibility testing of these common organisms may be performed on the bench without the use of a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>Organisms which cause serious human or animal disease and pose a high individual risk, but low community risk, are classified as Risk Group III (1). Bacteria belonging to this group include: </p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><td><i>Bacillus anthracis</i> </td><td> <i>Brucella</i> (all species)	 </td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Burkholderia mallei</i> </td><td> <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i>	</td></tr><tr><td><i>Francisella tularensis</i> </td><td> <i>Yersinia pestis</i> </td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> </td><td><i>Mycobacterium bovis (non-BCG strains)</i> </td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Pasteurella multocida Type B</i> </td><td></td></table>

<p>The risk of laboratory-acquired infection due to these agents is significant unless cultures are processed under a biological safety cabinet. Most Canadian clinical microbiology laboratories encounter 
bacteria that belong to this group infrequently. However international travel and immigration, and the improved sensitivity of automated blood culturing systems have increased the likelihood of recovery of these 
high risk bacteria. </p>
<p>Two members of this group, <i>Brucella</i> and <i>Francisella</i>, can pose a significant challenge for laboratories that are unfamiliar with these genera, particularly when the suspicion of brucellosis or tularemia has not been communicated to the microbiology staff. This article will focus on guidelines that will assist with safe handling and preliminary identification of these bacteria for the routine microbiology laboratory. </p>
<p><i>Brucella</i> and <i>Francisella</i> are highly infectious and cultures must be processed under a biological safety cabinet. The use of gloves is also imperative since <i>Francisella</i> (2,3) and <i>Brucella</i> (4) may gain entry through small skin abrasions. Biosafety level 3 is recommended for manipulation of large quantities of these organisms (4,5) but this level of containment is not available in most routine laboratories. </p>
<p>Brucellosis and tularemia are considered to be zoonotic diseases and human infection is typically  associated with direct contact with infected animals or the adjacent contaminated environment (4,6). 
Additionally, <i>Brucella</i> may be acquired as a result of indirect transmission via milk, milk products or meat (4), and a history of travel to, or immigration from, the Middle East, India, Mexico and Central and South America  may alert the laboratory to the potential recovery of this organism (5). 
<p>In our experience, <i>Brucella</i> species have also been encountered in aboriginal populations from the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.  
<i>Francisella tularensis</i> is found  in Canada and the United States and contact with both wild and domestic animals may be an important clue to its subsequent identification (2,3,7,8).  </p>
<p>Front-line laboratory staff should be aware of the significance of clinical information suggesting infection with any Risk Group III pathogen, including <i>Brucella</i> and <i>Francisella</i>,  and initiate prompt follow up with the microbiologist before the specimens are processed. All manipulation of these specimens including primary culture,  identification and susceptibility testing, should be performed in a biological safety cabinet.  </p>
<p>Sharing the suspicion of brucellosis or tularemia with the microbiology laboratory will also ensure the selection of appropriate culture media and prolonged incubation that may be required for successful recovery of these pathogens. Typical <i>Francisella tularensis</i> species require media enriched with cysteine for primary isolation (2,6), but atypical strains recovered on unsupplemented blood agar have been reported (7,8), and this can cause confusion with the organism identification. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, diagnoses and/or patient histories are infrequently provided for microbiology specimens. It is in this situation that laboratory staff are placed at highest risk of infection. While aerosol-producing procedures, including primary subculture of positive blood culture vials, are routinely conducted in a biosafety cabinet, subsequent testing of the isolate is typically performed on the open bench. Early recognition of highly infectious bacteria is therefore important to minimize the risk of laboratory exposure. </p>
<p>The Gram stain provides the first evidence that the isolate may be either <i>Brucella</i> or <i>Francisella</i>. The cellular morphology of both genera is distinct. Faintly staining, tiny, gram-negative coccobacilli (0.2 - 0.5 X 0.6 - 1.5 µm) should alert the technologist to the infectious potential of the culture (2). Unfortunately, morphology is not specific for these species, and other organisms including <i>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Pasteurella multocida</i>  and <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> may present similar morphology. Isolation of B. pertussis from non-respiratory specimens is exceedingly  rare, but invasive disease has been reported (9) and so this species cannot be ruled out based only on specimen source. <i>Acinetobacter</i> and <i>Moraxella</i> species have also been described as small gram-negative coccobacilli, 
however they are generally larger than the previously mentioned species and may also resist decolorization (10). </p>
<p>To ensure safety, all tiny gram-negative coccobacilli should be processed in a biosafety cabinet until <i>Brucella</i> or <i>Francisella</i> can be ruled out. Arriving at a definitive identification, however,  is difficult for laboratories with limited media resources and prompt referral of suspicious isolates to a reference laboratory may provide a more timely diagnosis. Cell wall fatty acid analysis (CFA) is particularly useful for recognition of <i>Brucella</i> and <i>Francisella</i> but has limited utility in differentiating between <i>Pasteurella, Actinobacillus</i> and <i>Haemophilus</i>. Basic organism characterisitics that may assist with the preliminary identification are provided in Table 1. The CFA profile reported here provides fatty acids that are present in significant amounts (&gt;10% of the total). </p>
<p>Since many laboratories now rely on commercial identification systems, it is important to recognize their limitations; inaccurate identification of both <i>Brucella</i> (10,12) and <i>Francisella</i> (7) has been reported. One popular text book (10) suggests the use of phenylalanine deaminase and an acid xylose reaction as a method to differentiate <i>Brucella melitensis</i> from <i>Moraxella phenylpyruvica</i>. While these authors correctly state that phenylalanine should be positive for <i>M. phenylpyruvica</i>, in our experience, this test is also positive 
for <i>Brucella</i> species including <i>B. melitensis</i> (unpublished data). Even xylose utilization is reported inconsistently for B. melitensis with some authors reporting an acid reaction for this species (10,12) and 
others reporting a negative result (13). </p>
<p>Since <i>Brucella</i> and <i>Francisella</i> are uncommon isolates that may require specialized media and techniques to verify the identification, referral to a reference laboratory for confirmation is recommended. </p>
<p>Alerting the reference  laboratory to the potential of a Risk Group III organism will ensure that isolates are handled appropriately upon receipt. </p>
<p>Recent laboratory restructuring and the resulting cross-training of technologists has provided new learning opportunities. It has, however, also highlighted the need for vigilance in the recognition of 
uncommon isolates, especially those that pose a significant risk to laboratory staff. Commercial identification tools are an integral part of today's bacteriology laboratory, but the skill of the technologist in 
the accurate interpretation of morphological characteristics of unusual organisms remains critical to safe, timely, accurate identification. Good communication between clinicians, microbiologists and front-line 
laboratory staff will ensure safe management of highly infectious bacteria.  </p>
