<h1>Errata for Early Printings of The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)</h1>
</center>
Errata for
<a href="homepage.html">
Bjarne Stroustrup</a>:
<a href="3rd.html">
The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition)</a>,
Addison-Wesley, 1997. ISBN0-201-88954-4.
<p>
I classify the errata into two categories. "Errors and Clarifications"
are things that could impare understanding.
This catagory contains more clarifications than corrections of "errors."
"Typos" are spelling and grammar mistakes.
<p>
For brevity, I use the old replacement syntax: s/old/new/
<p>
I very much appreciate reports of errors and constructive comments
on the contents in general.
I try to document and fix errors as soon as I can, often a day or two after I find the problem.
<p>
Note that index terms often refer to the page where the discussion of a topic begins rather
that to the page where a term first occurs. This occationally makes the index appear
to be off by one.

You find the printing number at the bottom of the copyright page.
<p>
A few apparent errors are left because they reflect
<a href="3rd_issues.html">open issues</a>
that I expect to be resolved in favor of what the book says.
<p>
I have been asked "Why is there so much errata?"
Because
<ul>
<li> it's a long book;
<li> I fix and document any problem that comes to my attention - even if it strictly speaking isn't an error;
<li> there still are some minor changes coming from the standards effort;
<li> I do clarifications and minor improvement based on readers' comments.
</ul>
Also: "Do the errors compromise the book's utility?"
The comments I have received from reviewers and readers indicate that this is not the case,
and that the book manages to get the key concepts and the understanding of technical
details across as intended.
If you count omissions and inaccuracies as errors, even the 1st printing this
book had fewer errors than most textbooks and references.
