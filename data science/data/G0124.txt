<p>
Astronomy is the oldest of the sciences.  When Stoneage humans turned to an 
agrarian way of life and began to settle into communities, their interest must 
naturally have turned to the "heavens":

<ol>
<li> The seasons became important;  during different times of the year, 
different stellar patterns appear in the sky.  In the spring, 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/map/VIR.html">Virgo</a> and her 
accompanying constellations signal the time to prepare the earth, 
to plant crops, and to be wary of floods.  In the fall, 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/map/ORI.html">Orion</a> rises 
to indicate time to harvest and to prepare for winter.
<li>
The approximate equivalence of the human menstrual cycle and the 30 day 
orbital period of the Moon which produces 
<a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html"> lunar phases</a> led to the 
belief that the heavens, and the Moon in particular, were related to fertility.
(What is the Moon's phase <a href="http://www.lunaroutreach.org/qpom/">right 
now</a>?)
<li>
To early humans facing an uncertain and changeable future, the constancy of 
the heavens must have suggested perfection and certainly led to deification 
in many cultures.
<li>
We may expect that 
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/edu/eclipses.htm">eclipses</a>
would have been especially frightening to early humans.  After predicting
the seasons, eclipse prediction may have been one of the earliest astronomical 
activities.
</ol>
<p>

<img align=LEFT valign=top src="./images/history/heelstone.gif"> 
<a href="http://witcombe.bcpw.sbc.edu/EMStonehenge.html">Stonehenge</a>, 
constructed between 3100-2000 BCE on  England's Salisbury Plain, may have 
been a Stoneage <a href="http://witcombe.bcpw.sbc.edu/EMStonehengeD.html">
astronomical site</a> (observatory is too strong a word), at 
least in part.  Certainly the alignment of the "heelstone" with the rising 
Sun on Midsummer's Day (June 21, the Summer Solstice) represents a true 
astronomical alignment, and many other Megalithic sites have similar 
alignments.  In <i>Stonehenge Decoded</i>, astronomer Gerald Hawkins argued 
that there exist a large number of astronomical alignments, though further 
study suggests that many of these are fortuitous.  <p>

Cosmologist Fred Hoyle has suggested that Stonehenge may have been used to 
keep track of the solar-lunar eclipse cycle.  Far outside the still partially 
standing ring of Sarsen Stones is a 
<a href="./images/history/Stonehenge_map.jpg">ring</a> of 56 holes, known as the 
Aubry holes.  Hoyle has noted that movement of a marking stone by 3
positions each time the Sun rose over the heelstone (or by one position
three times yearly) would complete a circle in 18.67 years -- approximately
the period for the "nodes", the intercepts of the lunar and solar paths in
the sky, to complete a cycle.

Certainly <a href="http://www.sacredsites.com/1st30/stonehen.html">ritual</a>
use of Stonehenge would have been more important that its astronomical 
functions and much of this interpretation must remain speculation.  We may 
be certain, however, that Stonehenge was indeed constructed by Stoneage humans 
without the assistance of alien astronauts as suggested in some 
pseudo-scientific books.  Visit the

<p>

Eastern observers, notably the Chinese, kept careful track of events in the 
skies, particularly the appearance of "guest stars" -- comets, novae and 
other transients. Chinese records of the guest star that we now call 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">
Comet Halley</a> can be traced back to 240 BCE and possibly as early as 
1059 BCE.
One of the most important Chinese records is of a 
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/96/22/crabhist.html">guest 
star</a> 
that was bright 
enough to be seen during the daytime for nearly a month in the 
constellation that we call Taurus in July 1054.  We believe this to be the 
supernova explosion that gave rise to the 
<a href ="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/n1952.html"> 
Crab Nebula</a>, and our knowledge of the date of the explosion itself is 
a very important key in understanding the deaths of massive stars.
This event was also chronicled by the Anasazi in
<a href="http://www.chaco.com/park/archaeology/nebula.html">Chaco Canyon</a>
and by Native Americans elsewhere, but is curiously absent from European 
records in the Middle Ages.
<p>
As the above suggests,
<a href="http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/hist_astr/ha_items_archaeo.html">Archaeoastronomy</a> is an active and exciting field of research.<p>

Western scientific history begins with the ancient Greek civilization about 
600 BCE.<p><center>

The Ionian region of Asia Minor appears to have been a site of 
particular philosophical/scientific/mathematical activity for several 
centuries.</p>
<BR>
<p>  We will review the progress of science by highlighting a few key 
natural philosophers, scientists and mathematicians. As Isaac Newton
said,"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of
Giants."</P>

<h3><img align=LEFT valign=top src="./images/history/pythagoras.gif"> 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html">
Pythagoras of Samos</a> (~580-500 BCE) </h3> Most famous for his 
<A HREF="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/hamilton/ham.rttriangles.html">
theorem,</A> little is known of his actual work. He founded a school
(some would call it a cult) of natural philosophy and mysticism that 
attracted many followers.  The Pythagoreans lived by a strict regimen 
including vegetarianism, silence for the first 5 years of membership, and 
anonymity with respect to personal accomplishments (so that it is difficult 
to know what to ascribe to Pythagoras as opposed to his followers).  The 
Pythagorean Theorem was actually known to the early Babylonians, but it may 
be that Pythagoras was the first to prove it.  The Pythagoreans recognized the 
existence of irrational numbers and were interested in the relationship 
between music and mathematics.<p>

Pythagoras developments in astronomy built upon those of Anaximander from 
whom, apparently, came the idea of perfect circular motion.  The Pythagoreans 
believed that the planets were attached to crystalline spheres, one for each 
planet, which produced the 
<A HREF="http://einstein.stanford.edu/education/bibliography/newsci1.htm"><i>
Music of the Spheres</i></A>.  These spheres were centered on the Earth, which
was itself in motion.  Pythagoras is also credited with recognizing that the 
"morning star" and "evening star" are both the planet Venus.<p>

<h3><img align=RIGHT valign=top src="./images/history/aristotle.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristotle.html">
Aristotle</a> (384-322 BCE)</h3> Aristotle was a student of Plato, founding 
his own school of Natural Philosophy, the Lyceum, in Athens about 335 BCE. 
Aristotle's philosophy involved the qualitative study of all natural 
phenomena, pursued without the aid of mathematics which was deemed to  be 
too "perfect" for application on an imperfect terrestrial sphere.
In Aristotelian cosmology, the "imperfect" Earth was situated
at the center of the Universe (Solar System). It was composed of the four 
elements: earth, air, water, and fire,  each of which sought its natural 
place in the Universe (<i>e.g.</i> earthen bodies fall to Earth, rain falls 
from the sky, travelling through rivulets, to streams, to rivers and finally 
to the sea).  Aristotle adopted Pythagoras' model of concentric spheres for 
the planets, but deduced that the Earth must be immobile.  Aristotle's Natural 
Philosophy was embodied in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas and became the 
foundation of Church doctrine and University instruction in medieval times.<p>

<h3>
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html">
Aristarchus of Samos</a> (~310-230 BCE)
</h3>
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Kristen/Aristarchus.html">Aristarchus</a> 
concluded that the Solar System must be heliocentric, following his 
geometrical estimates of the
<a href ="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/aristarchus.htm">
relative sizes and distances of the Earth, Moon and Sun</a>.  His geometrical 
methods were perfectly correct, but the required observations of the 
<em>exact</em> time of first and third quarter Moon and the duration
of lunar eclipse were beyond the instrumental capabilities of his era.
He calculated that the Sun is about twenty times farther away than the Moon, 
about 20 times larger than the Moon and ten times bigger than the Earth. 
Unfortunately, all of Aristarchus work was lost in the great fire in 
Alexandria which destroyed the magnificent
<A HREF="http://peicommerce.com/HISTORY/EUROPE/GREECE/EGYPT/LIBRARY.HTM">
library </A>and its records of Greek science and culture.
A lunar <a href="./images/history/aristarchus.jpg">crater</a> bears his name 
in recognition of his accomplishments.


<h3>
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Eratosthenes.html">
Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> (276-197 BCE)
</h3>

Eratosthenes was a mathematician and geographer.  He developed a
<a href="http://www.kent.pvt.k12.ct.us/Departments/general_studies/maperat.htm">map of the world</a>, a method for finding prime numbers called 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EratosthenesSieve.html">
Eratosthenes' Sieve</a>, and estimated the 
<a href="http://share2.esd105.wednet.edu/jmcald/Aristarchus/eratosthenes.html">
circumference of the Earth</a>.  His method involved determining the direction 
to the Sun in Alexandria at noon on the summer solstice and comparing this 
with the fact that the Sun is overhead in Syene(Aswan), about 500 miles away.
Here are the results of a worldwide high school

Claudius Ptolemy</a> (~85-165AD)

Ptolemy, Alexandrian (Greek) mathematician, geographer, and astronomer, 
developed the most sophisticated 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/ptolemaic_system.html">
mathematical model</a> of the motions of the Solar System based upon the 
geocentric (Earth-centered) model and the principle of perfect circular 
motion.  His model was quite complex in order to follow the details of 
planetary motions, requiring circles (<i>epicycles</i>) upon off centered 
circular orbits.  His major astronomical work is known as

Nikolas Kopernig</a> (Copernicus, 1473-1543)
</h3>

Copernicus studied mathematics and astronomy in Cracow and Italy, but spent 
his life as a physician, attorney and church administrator.  By Copernicus' 
time, the Ptolemaic model could no longer reproduce the observed planetary 
positions.  Copernicus developed a 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/copernican_system.html">
heliocentric model</a> of the Solar System which retained the notion of 
perfect circular motion, but placed the Sun at the center and established 
the proper order of the planets outward from the Sun.  Copernicus model, a 
mathematical <i>tour de force</i> (not bad for an amateur), was published in 
<i> De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium</i> in 1543, the year of his death.

<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/People/tycho_brahe.html">
Tyge (Tycho) Brahe</a> (1546-1601)

Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe is chiefly remembered for his meticulous

observations</a>, made with <a href="./images/history/brahe_quadrant.gif">
instruments</a> of his own design before the advent 
of the telescope.  His early observations were carried out on the island of 
<a href="http://www.landskrona.se/kommun/kultforv/museum/Tycho/e_tycho.htm">
Hven</a> (now Swedish) where he built a pair of observatories, 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Images/Arch/Uraniburg/">
Uraniborg</a> and later Stjerneborg.  In 1572 he observed a supernova and 
in 1577 a comet. His parallax measures demonstrated that these objects were 
beyond the Moon, and his measures of the brightness of the supernova showed 
that it was clearly variable.  Tycho's measurements of planetary positions 
were at variance with the ptolemaic model. He developed his own 
<a href="./images/history/tycho_univ.gif">Solar System model</a> in which the 
Sun orbits the Earth, but the remaining planets orbit the Sun.  Tycho's
abrasive nature ultimately led him into disfavor. He moved to the court of
Rudolph II in Prague in 1599 where he would pass along his observations to
Johannes Kepler. These became the basis for Kepler's Laws of Planetary
Motion.


<h3><img align=right valign=top src="./images/history/gg.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html">
Galileo Galilei</a> (1564-1642)
</h3>
There is an exquisite WebSite, <a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/">
The Galileo Project</a> about Galileo and his world put together by Rice 
University's History department. Many of the following links are to pages on 
this site.  Another excellent site at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is 
<a href="http://www.crs4.it/Ars/arshtml/arstitle.html">The Art of 
Renaissance Science</a>.
<p>

Galileo was the first "modern scientist".   He argued that mathematics, rather 
than being abstract perfection, is the true language of science.  He performed 
many revolutionary experiments in mechanics and other fields of physics.  
Among his accomplishments in mechanics are:

<ul>
<li> 
development of the concept of inertia, later refined by Newton.
<li>
a variety of experiments on falling bodies which demonstrated that the 
<i>acceleration of gravity</i>
<a href="./gloss#gravity"><sup><img src="./images/doodads/bk_sm.gif"></sup></a>
is independent of mass.  There is no evidence that 
Galileo actually dropped objects from the Tower of Pisa. 
Rather, his experiments were conducted with an
<a href="http://galileo.imss.firenze.it/museo/4/eiv13.html">inclined plane</a>
as shown in this 
<a href="http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/Animation/galileo.falling.html">
animation</a>.
<li>
the first Theory of Relativity, valid for velocities much smaller than the 
speed of light.
</ul><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT"  SRC="./images/history/GGtelescope1.gif">Using telescopes of his 
own design and manufacture, Galileo also made many discoveries
in astronomy: 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/sunspots.html">
sunspots</a> on the Sun and 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/moon.html">craters and 
mountains</a> on the Moon.

<li>
The so called 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/jupiter_satellites.html">
"Galilean satellites"</a> which orbit Jupiter -- Io (with the volcanos), 
Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.  Here's 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Student_Work/Astronomy95/jupiter.html">more</a> on Jupiter and her satellites from the 
<i>Siderius Nuncius</i> and an 
<a href="http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/Animation/galileo.moons.html">

<li>
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/saturn.html">rings</a>
of Saturn.

<li> the <a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Images/Astro/Venus/venus.gif">phases of Venus</a>.
</ul>

Galileo's observations suggested that the heavens were as "imperfect" as the 
Earth; that other objects in the Solar System have satellites which orbit 
around them, and that Venus passes through a full range of 
phases. These observations led him to the conclusion that the  
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/copernican_system.html">
Copernican Model</a> of the Solar System is preferable to the 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/ptolemaic_system.html">
Ptolemaic Model</a>.  Galileo published his views in Italian in <i> Dialogues 
Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</i> in 1632.  They were in direct
contradiction to the world-view taught by the Catholic Church, and he was 
called before the Italian 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/inquisition.html"> 
inquisition</a> in 1633. Galileo was forced to disavow his work, and was
sentenced to house arrest for the remainder of of his life.

<h3><img align=left valign=top src="./images/history/jk.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kepler.html">
Johannes Kepler</a> (1571-1630)
</h3>
<a href="http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/johannes.html">
Kepler</a> came to Prague to work with Tycho Brahe and his observational data. 
Kepler was a mathematician and mystic, interested primarily in numerical 
relationships among objects in the Universe.  Using Tycho's unprecedentedly 
accurate observations, he made highly precise calculations of 
planetary orbits.  Although he could come very close to matching Brahe's 
data with perfect circlular orbits, his faith in the data led him to continue 
his calculations until he matched Tycho's accuracy.  Kepler developed three 
mathematical
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/kepler.html">rules</a>
for the orbits of the planets:
<ol>
<li>
The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one focus.
<li> 
The planets sweep out equal areas during equal times of the orbit.
<li>
The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the planet's 
distance from the Sun. (If you measure the period in Earth years and the 
distance in Astronomical Units (1 A.U.= the average distance of the Earth 
from the Sun), then Period<sup><FONT SIZE=+1>2</sup></FONT> = Distance
<sup><FONT SIZE=+1>3</sup></FONT>.) </ol><p>
Here's a page with some nice <a href="http://www.cvc.org/science/kepler.htm">
animations</a> of Kepler's Rules, and here is 
<a href="http://observe.ivv.nasa.gov/nasa/education/reference/orbits/orbit_sim.html">another</a> way to play with them.
<p>

Obviously Kepler's Rules require that the Sun be the center of the Solar 
System, in contradiction with the Aristotilean ideal.  The first rule 
eliminates the circular motion which had been fashionable for 2 millennia.  
The second replaces the idea that planets move at uniform speed around their
orbits,with the empirical observation that the planets move more rapidly when
they are close to the Sun and more slowly when they are farther away.  The 
third rule is a harbinger of the 
<A HREF="http://beast.as.arizona.edu/textbook/equations/2_NULoG.html"> Law 
of Gravitation </A> which would be developed by Newton in the latter part 
of the 17<sup>th</sup> century.

<h3><img align=right valign=top src="./images/history/in.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Newton.html">
Isaac Newton</a> (1642-1727)
</h3>
Certainly the greatest classical Physicist, Newton developed the science of 
mechanics as we know it.  His first development was his 
<a href="http://acept.la.asu.edu/courses/phs110/course_info/class_notes/laws/laws.html"> Laws of Motion</a>.  In order to perform mechanical calculations and 
to understand Gravity, Newton invented a mathematical tool that he called 
"fluctions", now known as 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html"> calculus</a>.  At the urging of <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Halley.html"> Edmund Halley</a>, Newton 
published his Laws of Motion and analysis of Gravity in the <i>Principia 
Mathematica</i>, probably the greatest physics text ever written, in 1687.
Halley, of course, wanted to use Newton's theories to analyze
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Orbits.html">
orbits</a>, particularly that of the comet of 1682 which now bears his name.

<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Einstein.html">
Einstein</a> (1905) developed the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/NumRelHome.html">Theory of
Special Relativity</A>, based upon the
idea that light travels at the same speed in all frames of reference.
Modified Newton's Theory of Gravity by developing the General Theory of
Relativity (1916).

<li>
Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin &amp; Henry Norris Russell determined the 
composition of stars.

<li>1924 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hubble.html">
Edwin Hubble</a> established that the Andromeda nebula and other "spiral
nebulae" are star systems like the Milky Way at great distances.

<li>
1929 Hubble &amp; Milton Humason discovered that the Universe is expanding.

1938 <A HREF="http://spaceboy.nasda.go.jp/note/kagaku/e/kag120_bethe_e.html">
Hans Bethe </A> determined that the Sun's energy comes from thermonuclear
fusion reactions.

<li>
1940s <A HREF="http://seti1.setileague.org/songbook/jansky.htm">Karl Jansky</A>
observed that the nucleus of the Milky Way and other celestial objects are 
strong sources of Radio Waves in 1931.  Based on radar technology developed in 
WWII, <a href="http://web.haystack.mit.edu/education/radiohist.html">Radio
