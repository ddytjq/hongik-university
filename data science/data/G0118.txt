<P>&#9;This chapter is about the evolution in systems where the interaction
does not end with a single impulsive collision.  Specifically, we will
consider morphologies that are either produced in multiple collisions, or
formed on comparable timescales.  We also begin the discussion of several long
term dynamical processes like dynamical friction and collisionally induced bars.

<P></P>
<P><B>5.1  Dynamical Friction - Bringing It Back.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Dissipative collective effects are an important part of the reason why
galaxy mergers are common, and a key process in galaxy evolution.  Dynamical
friction is the primary dissipative effect.  In astrophysics this process was
discovered by Chandrasekhar (1942, 1943), and completely developed for the
case of a massive object moving through an infinite, homogeneous sea of low
mass objects with which it interacts gravitationally.  The basic idea is that
the massive object pulls the low mass objects towards  itself as it moves
through them, generating an overdense wake.  The gravitational pull of the
wake in turn decelerates the massive object, much like a frictional force. 
Chandrasekhar derived a simple analytic formula for this force; a brief
version can be found in BT (sec. 7.1).  His first application was to stars in
star clusters that randomly acquired speeds greater than the escape speed from
the cluster.  These stars might be retained, and the cluster's life prolonged,
as a result of dynamical friction.  Another application was to star clusters
moving through a background of &quot;field&quot; stars in a galaxy.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Chandrasekhar's formula was not applied to colliding galaxies until the
1970s.  First, it was recognized as the cause of sinking satellites.  In terms
of the basic theory this is the same problem as the star cluster in the
galaxy, but with a small satellite galaxy instead (see the review of Ostriker
1977).  Then, Toomre (1977) argued for its operation in collisions between two
galaxies in order to explain the results of early N-body simulations.  While
the sinking satellite studies showed it was a mechanism of satellite
accretion, Toomre suggested it was the agent of what are now called major
mergers.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This stimulated renewed interest in the process, and in Chandrasekhar's
formula in particular.  There are several problems in the application of this
formula, however (see e.g., Tremaine and Weinberg 1984, Sequin and Dupraz
1996).  The first is that in its derivation, the force integration over all
the infinite sea of low mass &quot;stars&quot; diverges unless minimum and
maximum impact parameters are selected.  The ratio of these impact parameters
appears in the so-called Coulomb logarithm term (from plasma physics) in the
formula.  This means the formula depends on how these terms are selected, and
is essentially phenomenogical.  On the other hand, the quantitative dependence
on the parameters in this term is weak.  Moreover, there is a natural choice
for the values of the minimum and maximum parameters as the satellite and
primary galaxy sizes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The second difficulty is that the derivation suggests no way to modify
or generalize the assumption of an infinite, homogeneous background, e.g., to
a spherical galaxy with a declining density profile.  The third difficulty is
that even though the friction is the result of a long range force, an obvious
generalization is to identify the background density term with the local
density.  However, across a sharp density edge, this would give a
discontinuous change in the friction.  Finally, Tremaine and Weinberg noted a
surprising fourth problem, the formula is simply wrong in some cases -
</P>
<P></P>
<P>Kalnajs (1972) has computed the dynamical friction force in an artificial
but exactly soluble galaxy model consisting of a uniformly rotating sheet of
stars.  This is the only analytic model in which the collective effects due to
the self-gravity of the disc stars can be included.  Kalnajs finds that
collective effects modify the disc response so that there is no dynamical
friction.  (Tremaine &amp; Weinberg 1984, p. 730).</P>
<P></P>
<P>As more N-body studies were published in the early 1980s it became
increasingly clear that collective (feedback) responses were as important in
determining the friction as the summed effects of individual star-satellite
interactions (e.g., White 1983).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The paper of Tremaine and Weinberg (1984, henceforth TW) presented a
new analytic approach to dynamical friction which was capable of capturing
global responses, and overcame many of these difficulties.  Chandrasekhar's
formula derives from direct integrations over all two-body (star-satellite)
interactions.  TW's approach was a perturbation analysis of the Poisson and
Hamilton equations for a star moving in the galaxy potential, with the
additional perturbing potential due to the satellite.  Only after the stellar
accelerations were computed in the perturbation approximation were the
integrations over all stars carried out.  The two approaches were shown to
yield the same result for the infinite, homogeneous medium, but the
perturbation analysis can be carried out in the spherically symmetric case as
well.  Specifically, TW applied the analysis to the case where the perturbing
potential was a weak bar component, and derived the &quot;LBK torque
formula&quot; (after Lynden-Bell &amp; Kalnajs 1972) for the
&quot;frictional&quot; torque exerted on the bar.  Though this formula and the
procedure from which it is derived are very complex, no logarithmic
divergences result from this approach.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;At the conclusion of this calculation, TW note two important effects
that were not included: strong or resonant interactions, and the continuous
change in the motion of the bar or satellite.  The resonances are generally
transient, and TW were able to calculate their effects in a representative
case.  They found that the resonant interactions dominate the acceleration,
but that in the case of fast resonances the LBK formula is correct.  In the
case of slow resonances, reversible torques operate, and the LBK and
Chandrasekhar formulae are not applicable.  Resonant interactions also provide
a way for friction to operate even when the satellite is located outside the
galaxy.  In the end TW provide theoretical resolutions to all the problems of
the Chandrasekhar formula, and equally importantly, clarify when it is applicable.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Weinberg (1986, 1989) followed up this work with examples of explicit
perturbation calcutions of the wake structure and frictional drag on
satellites in circular orbit about spherically symmetric primary galaxies. 
The second paper, in particular, calculated the self-gravitational response of
the galaxy to the satellite wake in a specific case.  Weinberg found that in
this case the orbital decay time was increased by a factor of 2-3, primarily
due to the barycentric motion.  This motion is a global effect, which induces
a counterwake in the primary galaxy.  This effect provides a clear
illustration of why the approximation that dynamical friction cannot depend
only on the local density within a rigid galaxy.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;S&eacute;quin and Dupraz (1993, 1994, 1996) have studied dynamical
friction in the case of head-on galaxy collisions, using both N-body
simulations and an appropriately taylored version of the Weinberg formalism. 
The 1993 reference presents a summary and comparison between the analytic and
numerical results.  Again global effects, like the tidal distortion of both
galaxies are found to be important.  Moreover, radial encounters &quot;are
both qualitatively and quantitatively different&quot; from near circular
encounters.  The transient response in the radial case is one reason. 
Secondly, in the spherical harmonic expansion of the density and potential of
the primary galaxy, the monopole and dipole terms were found to be more
important in the radial case (see the 1993 paper).  In fact, these authors
find that in the radial case, almost all of the dynamical friction is due to
the first few harmonic terms.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Very recently, another perturbative approach, based on &quot;linear
response theory&quot; applied to the disturbing forces has been developed by
Colpi and Pallavicini (1998, and Colpi 1998), and Nelson and Tremaine (1997). 
When applied to the satellite accretion problems this method has comparable
successes compared to the other recent approaches.  Moreover, this method
makes clear the connection between this problem and the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical physics.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In sum, a much more complete understanding of the phenomena of
dynamical friction, a key ingredient in the merger process has been achieved
in the last two decades.  However, it has come with a high price in terms of
theoretical and analytical complexity.  The latter is obvious to the reader of
the references above.  By theoretical complexity I mean that many different
cases must be considered separately, and we cannot rely on a single, simple
formula.  However, there is a silver lining to this dark cloud - the new, more
complex theory is intimately connected to, and provides insights into, the
theories of tidal disruption and bar evolution.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>5.2. Simulational Examples of Dynamical Friction</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The theory described in the previous section, and in fact our
understanding of all intermediate timescale processes, are hard to check
observationally.  The tidal morphologies are usually messy and complex after
multiple encounters, and so, it is very difficult to decipher their specific
histories to the degree possible for those produced by single collisions.  On
the other hand, the systems have not yet settled down to quasi-equilibrium
states like older merger remnants.  Thus, the comparison of theory and
numerical experimentation is very important for understanding dynamical
processes operating on this timescale, while observational comparisons play a
smaller role at present.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Aside from merger simulations, which we defer to the next chapter, the
simulational studies relevant to dynamical friction theory are concentrated in
two areas - the sinking satellite problem, and its orthogonal counterpart,
which we might call the &quot;bobbing&quot; satellite.  The former are
generally assumed to be in circular orbits initially, and in the latter case
the satellites are on nearly radial orbits.  Let us consider the
&quot;sinkers&quot; first.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;<B>5.2.1. Sinking Satellites (IDe+/-)</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Most of the sinking satellite studies have concentrated on one of two
particular cases, either the satellite is assumed to be in a circular orbit
around a spheroidal (or spherical) primary, or if the primary is a disk
galaxy, the orbital plane of the satellite is assumed to have a small
inclination to that of the primary.  For brevity, I'll refer to the latter
case as the planar case.  A number of N-body studies were carried out in the
1980s, as were comparisons between them and the analytic works, notably the
work of Hernquist and Weinberg (1989).  This literature was succintly reviewed
by Athanassoula (1990).  In fact, this seems to have been an especially good
moment for a review, since several issues had recently been resolved.  In the
spheroidal case, a controversy in the literature over the role of self-gravity
was settled, in part by the realization of the importance the motion of the
primary galaxy about the center of mass.  More generally, the analytic work of
Weinberg discussed above demonstrated the global response of the interacting
system.  Hernquist and Weinberg's comparisons of analytic models and
simulations showed generally good agreement, particularly on the result that
sinking times are longer (e.g., a few times 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT>
</SUP> yr.)  than predicted by the Chandrasekhar formula.  There was excellent
agreement in limiting cases, and discrepancies could be understood as the
result of nonlinear effects not adequately included in the analytic model.  
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In the planar case, the realization of the role of resonance orbits (a
la Tremaine and Weinberg), and how their interactions can work in the opposite
sense of standard friction, was an important breakthrough.  Among the
important results cited by Athanassoula are the more rapid decay of heavy
satellites (a clear result of global effects), and the slower sinking of
satellites in retrograde and highly inclined orbits as compared to those in
prograde planar orbits (e.g., about 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></SUP> yr. in
the recent prograde model of Walker et al. 1996).  Since most of these effects
were considered in the previous section, we will not discuss them further. 
However, before leaving the sinking satellites, we will briefly note two
related effects.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The first is the Holmberg (1969) effect, which is the tendency he
found, in a modest sample (58) of edge-on disk galaxies, for small companions
to be found more frequently near the poles of the disk galaxy than near the
disk plane.  Quinn and Goodman (1986) drew the connection with our topic by
hypothesizing that the effect was the result of more rapid sinking rates for
satellites near the disk plane (especially the prograde population). 
Unfortunately, their simulations did not reveal a large enough difference
between polar and planar orbits to account for Holmberg's result.  This
prompted a re-examination of the effect itself, by means of several catalog
searches, but because of the small sample sizes a statistically significant
result could not be obtained.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Zaritsky et al. (1993b) have looked at the subject again with a
&quot;homogeneous&quot; sample of nearly 100 late-type spirals.  They found
evidence for a &quot;weak&quot; Holmberg effect for satellites within a
(projected) radius of about 50 kpc., with an isotropic satellite distribution
at larger radii.  Although the satellite numbers are still too small for
reliable conclusions, a weak result would seem more in accord with the theory
and simulations.  These authors also reported another, Holmberg-like effect, -
&quot;satellites on prograde orbits tend to be brighter than those on
retrograde orbits.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The second effect of planar sinking satellites is disk thickening via
dynamical heating as the satellite settles through the disk.  The basic effect
is straightforward - as long as the satellite is not completely disrupted it
serves as a scattering center for individual disk stars.  This effect was also
studied by Quinn and Goodman. They pointed out that, while the thickening
effect could potentially be very large based on the energy available, in fact,
it was modest in their simulations.  Instead they found that most of the
dynamical heating occured in the plane, i.e., the radial velocity dispersion
of disk stars increased much more than the vertical dispersion.  Yet the
effect was significant, and a number of studies in the last decade have
confirmed and elaborated the result.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Quinn and Goodman used a restricted N-body method in their simulations,
but the subsequent study of Quinn, Hernquist and Fullagar (1993) was fully
self-consistent with three components: a primary halo and disk, and a single
component satellite.  The later paper also considered higher inclination
orbits, where the companion was found to sink into the plane faster than it
sank in radius.  The satellites on higher inclination orbits increased the
vertical velocity dispersion as much as the other directions in the outer
disk.  The most ambitious simulational study to date is that of Walker, Mihos
and Hernquist (1996), using large-scale N-body simulations of three components
as in Quinn et al.  With 500,000 particles they were able to use a relatively
small companion (10% of the primary mass), but still have adequate particle
resolution of all components.  In their fiducial model a companion placed on a
30&#176; inclination orbit reached the center after 1.0 Gyr., retaining 45% of
its mass.  The primary disk was thickened by 60%, and all velocity dispersions
increased by comparable amounts.  Figure 16 shows the interesting structure
that developed through the course of this &quot;minor merger&quot;.  Another
recent N-body study, by Huang and Carlberg (1997), focusses on the fate of
low-density sinkers, and finds such companions can be destroyed without
contributing significantly to disk thickening.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;On the observational side, Reshetnikov and Combes (1996, 1997) have
recently compared a sample of 24 edge-on interacting disk galaxies to a
control sample with 7 objects.  They find that the interacting galaxies have a
much lower ratio of disk radius to disk thickness, which they attribute to the
combined effects of disk thickening and radial truncation.  Further studies
with larger samples would be very interesting.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;<B>5.2.2  Bobbing Satellites (IXx0)</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Satellites sinking on radial orbits, the &quot;bobbing&quot;
satellites, have been most studied as means to form shell galaxies, in which
case the satellite is usually assumed to have a very low mass, and be readily
disrupted.  Radial orbits have also been used in early studies of mergers
between nearly equal mass galaxies.  Both of these case are discussed in the
next chapter.  In their recent papers on dynamical friction S&eacute;quin and
Dupraz (1993, 1994, 1996) present N-body simulations of the case of head-on
collisions with intermediate mass companions (5-10% of the primary mass).  The
basic result is that satellites on parabolic orbits do not bob for long.  They
are generally merged within a few crossings, with the exception that
&quot;diffuse&quot; satellites are highly disrupted, as discussed above. 
There are some interesting differences relative to the circular case.  The
most important of these is the fact that the radial case is much more
time-dependent; dynamical friction occurs primarily in discrete jumps during
each interpenetration.  This is because the transient response of both
galaxies enhances the friction nonlinearly.  E.g., according to the authors,
&quot;between radial and circular orbits the relative contribution of the
monopolar term (contraction during the collision) to the total drag undergone
by the satellite decreases from dominant to zero.&quot;  Clearly, the
Chandrasekhar formula misses the dominant effect in this case.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;As noted in section 4.2, S&eacute;quin and Dupraz's simulations include
only single component galaxies.  The question of what happens to the disk in
multiple radial collisions has not yet been well studied, but the indications
are that it is a very interesting area.  First of all, the simulations of
Taniguchi and Noguchi (1991) show that if the relative orbit lies in the plane
of the primary disk the consequences can be incredibly violent, producing a
highly distorted &quot;wing&quot; galaxy.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;On the other hand, Lotan has studied the case where the relative orbit
is near the symmetry axis of the primary disk, i.e., the ring galaxy case, but
with multiple collisions (see Lotan-Luban 1990 and discussion in AS96).  She
used restricted three-body simulations with the inclusion of the Chandrasekhar
formula for dynamical friction.  Thus, the results cannot be regarded as
accurate, but they reveal a fascinating effect whose existence should not
depend on the details of the friction.  If the companion returns while ring
waves are still propagating through the disk, it imparts a new impulsive
radial perturbation onto the pre-existing pattern of radial phase
oscillations.  The result is like wave interference, with enhanced wave
amplitudes at some radii, and near cancellation at others.  Qualitatively, it
would seem that the strong impulsive friction found by S&eacute;quin and
Dupraz would speed the return and enhance this effect.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In conclusion, simulation results and the current analytic theory of
dynamical friction are in good accord.  Because of the complexity of the
latter, simulations can still produce surprises.  The history of the Holmberg
effect illustrates just how difficult comparison to observation can be when
subtle dynamical effects are involved.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>5.3.</B> <B>Halo Braking</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This topic is closely related to the previous one, since both deal with
an intermediate time effect that draws galaxies together.  Galaxy and galaxy
group halos play a key role in accelerating the pace of successive collisions
and mergers.  Actually, there are several specific effects involved here.  The
first is just the fact that since galaxies have massive halos, they are much
more likely to be gravitationally bound at a given separation and relative
velocity than in the absence of such halos.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;There is evidence that galaxies in small groups are often contained in
an extensive dark halo.  For example, Ramella, Geller and Huchra (1989), in a
study of groups in the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey, found median
mass-to-light (M/L) ratios of about 180 in solar units, which is much larger
than typical values of individual galaxies.  They also found a median halo
scale size of about 500 kpc.  On the other hand, the M/L ratios in Hickson
compact galaxy groups are smaller, though still not small (about 50, according
to Hickson et al. 1992).  The collisional ring galaxy VII Zw 466 is part of a
small group, which was recently estimated to have M/L <FONT FACE="symbol">&#187;
</FONT> 70 (Appleton, Charmandaris, and Struck 1996).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Granted this result, we would expect that the dynamical friction on a
companion from this halo is a major effect, but this turns out to be an
oversimplification.  The review of Barnes and Hernquist (1992a, henceforth
BH92a) provides a good brief summary, as follows.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Roughly speaking, a pair of spherical, interpenetrating dark halos interact
as if they were single-component systems: the orbital angular momentum of the
two halos is transferred to internal degrees of freedom, imparting spin and
creating broad tails.  ...embedded disks and/or bulges, are not much braked by
the tidal forces retarding the dark matter; instead, these components lose
orbital angular momentum mostly by interacting with their own surrounding
halos, once the latter have been decelerated. </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These results are basically confirmed by recent N-body simulations of
mergers in galaxy groups.  E.g., Governato, Tozzi, and Cavaliere (1996) also
find that friction operates first on halos.  They also note the interesting
result that galaxies falling into a group can be stripped of their halos,
which can delay merger with the group galaxies.  The multiple merger
simulations of Weil and Hernquist (1996) also show the basic phenomenon of
prompt halo merger.  Their Figure 3 clearly illustrates the dynamical heating
of the halo in the merger process.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In sum, these results inspire a much more optimistic view of the
probability of collisions and mergers, compared to the general opinion when
Toomre proposed it in the 1970s.  Now, since most galaxies are born in groups,
collisions and mergers appear to be almost inevitable on a group free-fall
timescale.  </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>5.4. Tidal Stretching: Tails and Antennae (IXd+)</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Long tidal tails, jets, and plumes that stretch out to several galaxy
diameters or more, are some of the most spectacular structures formed in
galaxy collisions.  The Arp atlas contains a number of famous examples,
including well-known systems like the &quot;Mice&quot;, the
&quot;Antennae&quot;, and the &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot;.  Table 1 of
Schweizer (1983) contains a list of nearly two dozen.  Melnick and Mirabel
(1990) presented a number of additional southern examples, including the
&quot;Superantennae&quot; with a 350 kpc. long tail (Mirabel, Lutz, and Maza
1991)!  Figure 17 shows Appleton et al.'s HI map of the Leo plume, drawn out
from the galaxy NGC 3628.  Because of its proximity, this structure stretches
an incredible 40 degrees across the sky.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;We have already covered the mechanisms responsible for producing these
tails: it is simply tidal stretching and torques, and the slinging of outer
disk components that result from the motion of the potential center.  TT first
demonstrated that these mechanisms can produce such long structures,
specifically, in their models of the Antennae and the Mice systems.  The
result has been verified in more recent years with N-body simulations, e.g.,
by Barnes and Hernquist (1992b), Elmegreen, Kaufman, and Thomasson (1993) and
Mihos et al. (1993).  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Since tails are formed in essentially the same way as the &quot;tidal
transients&quot;, the reader might wonder why they are discussed here, rather
than in chapter 3?  The answer is that the kinematic timescales of such large
structures are long.  For example, consider the free-fall timescale, <FONT FACE="symbol">t
&#181; r</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>-1/2 </FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="symbol">&#181;
</FONT> (r<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP>/M(r))<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1/2</FONT>
</SUP>.  Within a dark matter halo M(r) <FONT FACE="symbol">&#181;</FONT> r,
so <FONT FACE="symbol">t &#181;</FONT> r.  Thus, at the end of a 100 Mpc long
tail, this timescale is of the order of a few Gyr., or longer if the halo does
not extend that far.  This helps understand the result of Barnes' (1988)
N-body simulations that tails are still evident after the galaxies that
produced them have merged.  Thus, the presence of tails can reveal the
collisional history of a galaxy when other traces have disappeared in the more
settled central regions.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The specific topic of the formation of star clusters or dwarf galaxies
in tidal tails deserves further discussion.  The idea that clusters or dwarf
galaxies can be formed in bridges and tails, and subsequently, with the
dissolution of the tail, be freed to orbit the galaxy dates to Zwicky (1956,
also 1959).  It seems likely that the idea was viewed as very novel at the
time.  Schweizer's (1978) discovery of the young cluster at the end of one of
the &quot;Antennae&quot; made it much more plausible by providing a good
example.  Mirabel et al. (1992) studied this object further, and concluded
that it was indeed a young, low-surface-brightness dwarf irregular galaxy.  
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Since then a number of other possible examples have been discovered,
including the Superantennae which has young star clusters distributed along
its great length.  Arp 105 may have formed two dwarfs in its collision(s), a
blue compact one to the south, and a Magellanic irregular in the north at the
end of a long plume (Duc and Mirabel 1994).  The interacting cluster galaxy
NGC 5291 is another example (Malphrus, Simpson, Gottesman, and Hawarden 1997,
Duc and Mirabel 1997, 1998).  A number of other examples have been studied
recently (Hibbard and Van Gorkom 1996, Duc et al. 1998, Deeg et al. 1998). 
Hunsberger, Charlton, and Zaritsky (1996) found 47 candidate dwarf galaxies
associated with tidal tails in a survey of 42 Hickson compact groups of
galaxies.  They estimate that as many as one half of the dwarf galaxies in
compact groups may be &quot;the product of interactions among giant parent
galaxies.&quot;  However, most of these objects have not been studied in
detail, so we lack evidence that they have the detailed characteristics of
dwarf galaxies, and specifically, are sufficiently strongly self-gravitating
to become independent entities (see discussion in Schweizer 1998, and the
models of Barnes 1998).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The phenomenon of star formation in tails is also of general interest
because SF is unusual so far from the center of the parent galaxies.  At first
sight this seems mysterious - should not gas stretched out of a disk be less
likely to form stars?  However, there are several interesting effects that
make it possible.  The first, discussed above in section 4.1.3, is the
tendency of bridges and tails produced by tidal torques to remain on a
two-dimensional surface, rather than spreading into the third dimension.  The
second is that, as discussed explicitly by Wallin (1990), and as is apparent
in early simulations, intersecting caustics and compression waves propagate
along tidal spirals and tails.  (This is true even when the tail itself is
primarily a material wave.)  These compressions may stimulate massive cloud
formation and star formation.  Furthermore, Elmegreen et al. (1993) have
argued that because large velocity dispersions are found in these tidal
structures, local gravitational instabilities assemble very large gas clouds. 
Both large clouds and large velocity dispersions were found in their N-body
simulations, as was the tendency for an &quot;extended gas pool&quot; to
accumulate at the end of the tidal arms.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Several of these phenomena can be understood as natural results of the
basic fact that in these types of collision, the orbit shapes of the gas
clouds in the outer disk are changed from nearly circular to primarily radial.
 The dispersion of radial phases generates the propagating caustic waves as
described in chapter 3.  The fact that there is an outermost excursion radius
for the radial particle orbits accounts for pileups at the ends of tails.  At
other locations within the tail, particles are moving both radially inward and
outward.  It is reasonable to expect that collisional interactions between gas
clouds moving in opposite directions may convert some of that motion into
enhanced velocity dispersions. </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Simulational studies of tail dynamics are advancing, but many of these
conjectures await testing with higher resolution, gas dynamical models.  Even
without gas there are complications.  For example, several recent studies have
clarified the role of halo structure in determining the morphology of stellar
tails, and how this dependence might be exploited to probe halos (Dubinski,
Mihos, &amp; Hernquist 1996, Mihos, Dubinski, and Hernquist 1998, and
references therein).  In any case, this is a very interesting environment for
studying details of the gravitational instability, both numerically and
observationally, if a wide range of length scales could be resolved.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>5.5.  Shells and Ripples</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The story of shell ellipticals is dramatic.  Their surprising discovery
initiated a decade of intense activity, after which the phenomenon is almost
taken for granted as another merger diagnostic, see Figure 18.  Presently,
work on a variety of outstanding questions continues more quietly.  Malin's
(1979) initial discovery of huge, sharp, edge or shell-like structures wrapped
around the &quot;normal&quot; elliptical M89 was all the more surprising
because it was the result of a little known photographic technique, called
unsharp masking (see Malin 1993).  Malin and Carter (1980, 1983) soon
presented more examples, and then a catalog.  Schweizer (1980, 1983) realized
that shells could be produced in mergers, and produced a list of merger
candidates with &quot;ripples&quot;, his preferred term.  For detailed
descriptions of shell morphologies and systematics see the review of Prieur
(1990), and references therein. </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;At the same time Quinn (1982, 1983) and Toomre (as quoted in Schweizer
1983) produced the first numerical simulations.  These works showed that it
was possible to produce sharp-edged features from the disruption of a small,
disk galaxy companion via multiple crossings of a large elliptical primary. 
Quinn (1984) presented several simulations and describing in detail how the
&quot;phase wrapping of the dynamically cold disk material&quot; produced the
shells.  The basic idea of this process is well illustrated by his Figure 5,
reproduced here as Figure 19.  (The figure shows that again, as in section 3,
we are dealing with radial caustics.)  Quinn also found that nearly radial
collisions did the best job of reproducing observed interleaved shell
morphologies.  High angular momentum collisions produced &quot;spatially
wrapped&quot; shells whose appearance depended strongly on viewing angle, and
which crossed and overlapped in ways that the shell ellipticals did not.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This suggested that shells were only produced in a rather narrow class
of collisions.  Since observations suggested that shells were not uncommon
around ellipticals, this appeared to be a weakness of the collisional theory. 
Alternate models had been proposed, and the interested reader can find a
summary of them in the review of Prieur (1990).  However, the situation didn't
lead to wider acceptance of these alternatives, but rather to a broader
investigation of the collisional model, and a number of new simulational studies.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In several papers, Hernquist and Quinn described, e.g., how shell
structure depended on the density profiles and shapes of dark matter halos
(1987, 1989).  These topics were also treated by Dupraz and Combes (1986). 
There was agreement that shells could be produced in a variety of different
potentials.  Thus, Hernquist and Quinn (1989) concluded that &quot;it will not
be possible to unambiguously determine the mass distribution of the primary
galaxy from observations of the morphology of shell systems alone,&quot;
ending an earlier hope.  More positively, both Dupraz and Combes (1986), and
Hernquist and Quinn (1988) generalized the initial studies by finding that
shell formation was possible in nonradial encounters, and with early type
(elliptical) companions.  This removed the major problem of the merger theory,
that it required fine-tuning.  Hernquist and Quinn (1989) also discovered that
the curious X-structures observed in some galaxies, were produced in some of
their simulations, and so could be the result of accretion in some cases (see
BH92a, and for a recent view, Mihos et al. 1995).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These simulations were of the restricted three-body, or similar test
particle, types, and as Dupraz and Combes pointed out, they did not resolve
one difficult problem.  This is the huge range of radii, up to a factor of 30
in the extreme case of NGC 3923 (see Figs. 20, 18).  Dupraz and Combes
conjectured that dynamical friction would play an important role in producing
such systems, and thus, self-consistent N-body simulations woudl be needed. 
At the turn of the decade, several papers showed that shells, in fact, could
be produced in self-consistent N-body simulations (e.g., Barnes 1989, Salmon,
Quinn, and Warren 1990).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Heisler and White (1990) made a detailed study of the radial structure
with simulations that included a self-consistent treatment of the companion
(in a low order, spherical harmonic approximation), and a rigid potential for
the primary.  They found that &quot;there is a substantial transfer of energy
in the various parts of the satellite&quot; in the disruption process.  This
is the key that allows some stars to be thrown out to great distances, while
other stars are left tightly bound to the primary center.  Moreover, &quot;the
most extensive shell systems are formed for satellites of relatively high mass
with mean densities similar to that of the primary.&quot;  Heisler and White
did not quite succeed in getting as large a range of shell radii as observed,
but they (also) speculated that the inclusion of dynamical friction might
complete the job.  In light of the impulsive dynamical friction found by
Sequin and Dupraz (1996, and see sections 5.1, 5.2 above), in radial
encounters with modest mass companions, this seems highly probable.  The
large-scale N-body simulation of Salmon et al. (1990) also showed a large
range of shell radii, suggesting this is correct.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Another possible solution is that the deep shells might, in fact, be
internal ripples in a small inner disk in the elliptical (Thomson and Wright
1990, also see discussion in BH92a).  However, the continuity of shell
intensities and colors with radius in NGC 3923 (Pence 1986, Fort et al. 1986),
argues against separate origins for some shells (although these works could
not treat the deepest shells).  Yet internal oscillations may be responsible
for some of the less regularly rippled systems.  This was shown by the models
of Wallin and Struck-Marcell (1988) of direct, off-center collisions, similar
to those that make ring galaxies, but with gas-poor primary disks.  At long
times, compared to the propagation time of an individual ring wave, the
asymmetric ringing produces shell-like features.  These ripples are not as
aligned or well-ordered as in classical shell systems like NGC 3923, but more
like the Type 2 systems of Prieur (1990, see Fig. 20).  They are, however,
phase and not material features. </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These models were inspired by observations of Arp 227, whose primary is
a rippled S0, which has not merged with its companion (Schombert and Wallin
1987).  However, a ring-ripple interpretation of this system is based in part
on the belief that the colors of the ripples and primary are similar, but
McGaugh and Bothun (1990) suggest that with proper subtraction of background
starlight the shells are somewhat bluer.  This might suggest that they were
accreted.  Recent work on Arp 10, a ring galaxy with outer ripples indicates
it may be a better ring-ripple example, whose companion is almost merged
(Charmandaris, Appleton and Marston 1993, Charmandaris and Appleton 1996).
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The shell galaxy story is largely based on optical observations of the
stars, but what about the gas?  We expect that multiple, near radial
collisions, which disrupt the stellar component, and presumably the halo, of
the companion to have a similarly catastrophic effect on the gas component. 
In the only substantial simulation study to date, Weil and Hernquist (1993)
showed that this is indeed the case.  Moreover, because of dissipation in the
gas, it rapidly became separated from the stars.  While the stars continued
their radial, shell-making oscillations, the gas settled into a compact inner
ring or annulus.  The cleaness of this result may, in part, be due to the
adopted approximation that the companion halo vanishes at closest approach in
the first collision, i.e., it is assumed to be of such low mass that it is
completely disrupted.  Nonetheless, the result is both reasonable, and as the
authors point out, supported by observations of compact disks in shell
ellipticals.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Yet the recent HI mapping studies of van Gorkom (e.g., Hibbard et al.
1995, Schiminovich et al. 1995) and collaborators have shown that gas shells,
ripples or streamers can also be found in interacting or merged systems.  This
is not to suggest a contradiction with the models or the theory.  The gas
structures resemble the messier ripple systems (Prieur Type 2), with usually
no more than a few features per system.  There are no (Type 1) examples with
numerous, interleaved gas shells.  The implication is that they are spatially
wrapped shells produced in high angular momentum collisions.  Another
possibility found by the author in unpublished simulations is that detached
streamers can be formed in off-center collisions involving two gas disks, when
there is partial overlap at impact.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Very recently, Kojima and Noguchi (1997) have carried out N-body
simulations of the merger of a gas-rich spiral and an elliptical galaxy, using
sticky particle hydrodynamics.  The stars from the disk galaxy make shells,
the gas is dispersed over a wider part of the volume containing the shells,
and star formation is terminated by the gas dispersal.  New simulations of
Charmandaris and Combes (1998, private communication) emphasize that a large
part of the morphological differences between the gas and star shells produced
in a given system are the result of the much greater radius of the initial gas
disk, and subsequent collisional kinematics.  These tentative results suggest
that this will be an exciting area for continuing work.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>5.6.  Induced Bars</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The collisionally induced formation of stellar bars is one of the most
important intermediate timescale process in terms of its long-term
consequences.  Hints of the importance of this process appeared early, but
since it is a collective effect, and requires fully self-consistent (N-body)
modeling, it took longer to realize its full ramifications.  For example,
Lynden-Bell (1979, also 1993 and Earn and Lynden-Bell 1996 for updated
pedagogical discussions) demonstrated that an oval perturbation can readily
induce bar formation in the rising rotation curve region of a galactic disk,
because of the nearly solid-body kinematics of such regions.  The work of
Toomre and Zang discussed above (Sec. 3.5) showed the Swing Amplification
process could also lead to bar formation.  However, the dramatic rapidity of
bar formation in prograde collisions, and the effectiveness of such bars in
funneling gas into the central regions was first, clearly demonstrated in
Noguchi's simulations (1987, 1988, also see his 1990 review, and the reviews
of Athanassoula 1994 &amp; Combes 1994).  </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>5.6.1.  Collisional Bar Formation</B></P>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The tidal forces in all non-central collisions naturally produce oval
distortions, but as kinematic features they would be expected to phase mix and
disappear relatively quickly.  The prograde planar interactions studied by
Noguchi (1987) produce a relatively strong and synchronous perturbation, as
discussed above in connection with tidal spirals.  Noguchi's models had two
components, a halo and a stellar disk.  The mass was initially distributed
such that there was a significant rising rotation curve region, where
Lynden-Bell's work would suggest induced bar formation was likely.  The size
of this region, and the disk-to-halo mass ratio were varied.  The only models
that didn't form bars were ones with small disk masses or very small rising
rotation curve regions.  In most cases the perturbation was strong enough, and
the disk sufficiently susceptible, that self-gravity was able to organize a
long-lived bar.  Similar but weaker, results were found by Byrd et al (1986),
whose flat rotation curve disk was less susceptible to bar-making.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Noguchi (1987) also found a number of interesting trends in his models.
 Firstly, bars formed more rapidly, and rotated faster, as the disk to halo
mass was increased.  Secondly, the same results were obtained when the halo
was made more centrally concentrated.  These results are not too surprising
since if the central mass is increased, then the fundamental gravitational
timescale is decreased.  Thirdly, the bars formed more rapidly and were much
longer when the companion galaxy mass was increased.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While these trends are very interesting in their own right, but the
general result is that bars should be even more common in interacting galaxies
than in isolated disk galaxies.  This provides a mechanism for understanding
analogous observational results.  For example, Elmegreen and Elmegreen (1982)
found that fraction of barred galaxies was 81% in binary systems, as compared
to 63% for isolated galaxies.  In a sample of 48 paired galaxies, Schweizer
(1987) found a higher percentage of systems containing at least one barred
galaxy among those systems with two disk galaxies, as compared to systems with
one disk and on spheroidal galaxy.  This last result provides some indirect
evidence for the mechanism of bar formation induced by prograde interactions
of disk galaxies.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;However, Noguchi's (1987, 1988) results had two significant
limitations: the models were two dimensional and the perturbing companion
masses were greater than or equal to that of the target galaxy.  One might
worry if collisionally induced bar formation would be weakened if stars could
be scattered into the third dimension, or if a very massive perturber was
required to induce bar formation in a galaxy that was stable against the bar
instability before the interaction.  (See BT sec 6.3, 6.5 for a discussion of
bar formation in isolated galaxies.  The work of Gerin, Combes and
Athanassoula (1990), included three dimensional simulations with 50% mass
companions, and thus, easied both limitations.  This work both supported and
extended Noguchi's results.  These three dimensional simulations had very
modest numerical resolution by current standards.  However, the basic result
has been reproduced in many subsequent simulational studies, and the idea of
collisionally induced bar formation is now a commonplace. </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>5.6.2.  Effects of Induced Bars</B></P>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Before Noguchi's collisional models, studies of bars in isolated
galaxies had shown the profound effects they can have on disk structure,
including: dynamical heating of the stellar disk, driving of spiral waves
(outside the region containing the bar), and inducing the radial flow of gas
(see the reviews of Athanassoula 1994, 1996b and Combes 1994).  The latter is
the most important effect in the case of collisionally induced bars because,
as Noguchi (1988) demonstrated, it is a means of funneling large amounts of
gas into the central regions.  This gas can, in turn, fuel nuclear starbursts
and active galactic nuclei, which are commonly found in collisional systems.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The simulations of Noguchi and others have left little doubt about the
effectiveness of this mass transfer process when a bar is present (e.g.,
Noguchi 1988, 1990, Barnes and Hernquist 1991, Mihos and Hernquist, 1996). 
The question is rather, what fraction of central SF and nuclear activity in
collisional galaxies is mediated by bars.  Noguchi suggested that this might
be the primary mechanism responsible for the high frequency of such activity
in interacting galaxies.  He specifically argued that this mechanism was much
more efficient at moving gas to the center than tidally induced spiral waves. 
Recently, Mihos (1994) has presented simulation results indicating that
&quot;under a wider range of interaction scenarios&quot; the bar mediated
process is more effective in inducing nuclear activity than another competing
process - mass transfer between galaxies.  Of course, the latter process,
discussed above, is generally much more transient.  Thus, with the caveat that
mergers, in which time-dependent torques and fluctuating gravitational fields
persist for some time, can generate the most intense nuclear activity,
Noguchi's conclusion has held up well.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;It is worth emphasizing that these simulations all involve parabolic,
and so, relatively impulsive collisions.  Thus, the longer timescale of the
central activity has little to do with the collision, whose main role is to
trigger bar formation.  The nature of the subsequent radial flows are
essentially no different than those in isolated galaxies.  The effects and
evolution of galactic bars have been the object of  intense study in recent
years, and there is a large literature on it (see the proceedings edited by
Sandquist and Lindblad 1996, and Buta, Crocker and Elmegreen 1996).  This
literature provides several results that are very relevant to the topic of
sustained inflows.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The first is that recent observational studies confirm that bars do
indeed enhance the global SFR in the central regions of galaxies containing
them (see the review of Kennicutt 1994 and references therein, and more
recently Huang et al. 1996).  However, the effect is more complicated than
originally thought.  In fact, centrally enhanced SF is only found in about 1/3
- 1/2 of the barred galaxies, and there is no difference between the global
SFRs of barred and unbarred galaxies.  There is also great diversity in the
morphology and distribution of star-forming regions in barred galaxies.  Yet
there do appear to be systematic trends, especially with Hubble type according
to Phillips (1993, as quoted in Kennicutt 1994).  Late-type barred galaxies
(SBc and later) &quot;show exponential bars, rising rotation curves,
relatively weak rings and star formation enhancements in the bar.&quot;  While
barred early-types &quot;contain flat stellar surface brightness profiles,
flat rotation curves, strong rings, but no star formation in the bar
region&quot; (Kennicutt 1994).  In the latter case, SF is found in the
circumnuclear region (often in rings), and in a normal distribution outside
the barred region.  Huang et al.'s recent study of the infrared properties of
a large sample of barred galaxies is generally in accord with these
generalizations, and adds the suggestion that &quot;availability of fuel&quot;
(HI gas) is especially important in the early types.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Recent theoretical and numerical models help us understand these
observations.  A fine summary is given in the review of Athanassoula (1994,
also see Sellwood and Wilkinson 1993, Athanassoula 1996a,b, Noguchi 1996b). 
In the first place Athanassoula makes it clear that the models have a
comparable degree of complexity.  The location, degree, and strength of
bar-driven shocks, as well as the presence of central rings or spirals, all
show considerable variation as a function of galaxy structural parameters.  A
second point that is especially relevant to collisionally induced bars, is
that &quot;the inflow is high during or after violent events like the
formation of the bar, and much less during quasi-steady slow evolution of the
bar.&quot;  Bar-driven circumnuclear activity should follow a similar history
following a collision or merger.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Athanassoula also summarizes current thinking on another important
question, even if there is gas inflow, how does this gas get down to the very
small radii that characterize the SF regions and active nuclei?  Overcoming
the centrifugal barrier would be difficult in itself, but there are additional
dynamical barriers.  Specifically, simulations show that the presence of an
inner Lindblad resonance (ILR, see section 3.5) is very effective at slowing
inflow, and retaining gas in a ring at the radius of the resonance.  Some, but
not all, galaxies have mass distributions that allow these resonances.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Shlosman et al. (1989) suggested a clever way around these
difficulties, the bars-within-bars scenario.  The basic idea is that the
driven inflow raises the central surface density, which triggers gravitational
instability on a small scale relative to the original bar.  On this scale the
potential is modified, so an ILR can be removed (or changed to a corotation
resonance), and gas can be funneled down to still smaller radii.  The reality
and efficiency of this process are supported both by self-consistent
simulations and observational evidence for small scale bars within a few
&quot;barred&quot; galaxies (e.g., Athanassoula 1994, Friedli 1996).  In
principle, this process can repeat itself, and a nested set of bars can form
and funnel gas down to arbitrarily small radii, though there is as yet little
evidence for many multi-level bars (see section 8.2).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In conclusion, studies of isolated barred galaxies do indeed provide
much insight into the question of what effects result from collisionally
induced bars.  However, they do not help much with the lingering questions of
what are the requirements for such bar formation?  Specifically, what
combinations of structural and collisional parameters are needed?  Since
relatively little of the parameter space has been studied, these questions
remain quite open.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>5.6.3.  Longevity, Frequency and Other Matters</B></P>
<P></P>
</CENTER>
<P>&#9;Investigations of a number of related questions have begun recently. 
The first of these questions concerns the longevity of bars.  While N-body
simulations have demonstrated that bars can be long-lived, they are also
subject to instabilities that can dissolve them.  Hasan and Norman (1990)
described how a central mass concentration, like a massive black hole,
generate stochastic regions in the orbital phase space.  As the central mass
is increased, these regions grow, in association with the development and
outward movement of an ILR.  Ultimately this leads to the dissolution of the
bar.  Pfenniger and Norman (1990) studied the case where the central mass
grows as a result of the inflow of gas clouds on weakly dissipative orbits. 
This generalized the earlier work by including a realistic growth process in
order to study the temporal development of the process.  The basic results of
the earlier study were confirmed, the diffusion of stars from the disk into
the bulge as the bar dissolved was also described.  The authors suggested that
a large fraction of all bulges might have formed by this mechanism, on a
timescale of about a few billion years.  The observational evidence for this
idea was subsequently reviewed by Kormendy 1993, with a generally favorable
conclusion, though the uncertainties are large. </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Later work with three dimensional simulations of accretion or the
merging of a small satellite supported the earlier results and is described in
the review of Pfenniger (1992) and Hasan, Pfenniger and Norman (1993).  The
case where the central concentration is a nuclear gas ring seems to be
somewhat different than the central point mass, according to the paper of
Heller and Shlosman (1996).  A related instability, the buckling or firehose
instability, was reviewed by Sellwood (1992), and simulations of how it
generates &quot;boxy&quot; or &quot;peanut&quot; shaped bulges were presented
by Combes et al. (1990).  Similar structures are formed from this instability
following the merger of a small companion in the recent simulations of Mihos
et al. (1995).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Bar longevity is closely coupled to another important question, what is
the relative fraction of induced vs. intrinisic bars?  If bars are relatively
short-lived compared to the age of the galaxies, then their high abundance
suggests that they are constantly being regenerated, by collisions or other
means.  However, many of the barred galaxies may not have an ILR, and have
relatively low inflow rates, and so may have much longer lives than those
studied in the papers above.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Noguchi (1996a, b) has recently presented a unified picture which
incorporates these ideas, and a number of others above, with the disk
formation process.  The latter connection is made by associating the inflow in
isolated galaxies with the accretion process in the formation of the disk.  Thence,
</P>
<P></P>
<P>...we propose that late-type barred galaxies, the disks of which are
considered to have formed by slow accretion of the halo gas, have intrinsic
origin, whereas the bars in early-type galaxies, whose disks are likely to
have grown quickly, have been formed in tidal interactions with other galaxies.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Numerical simulations...show that the bars created by tidal
perturbations tend to have a relatively flat density profile...whereas
spontaneous bars have a steeper profile.  ...this numerical result can explain
the observed dichotomy (between early and late-type barred galaxies)  Noguchi (1996a).
</P>
<P></P>
<P>These results are extended in Miwa and Noguchi (1998), who find that the
disk resonance structure and pattern speedsin isolated, &quot;intrinsic&quot;
barred models are different than those of bars produced in strong tidal
interactions.  The latter were found to rotate more slowly, in part, simply
because they tend to be derived from more stable, lower mass initial disks.  A
caveat is that weak tidal perturbations were found to produce bars whose
structure depends mostly on internal properties, and so, are more
&quot;intrinsic.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;One of these complications is the final question for us to consider in
this section, what effect do collisions have on pre-existing bars?  It appears
that this question was first addressed in the paper of Gerin, Combes, and
Athanassoula (1990), who noted that a tidal interaction could transiently
increase or decrease the strength and angular velocity (pattern speed) of a
pre-existing bar, depending on the relative phase at closest approach.  In
several recent papers Athanassoula (1996a,b, Athanassoula, Puerari, and Bosma
1996) has reported the results of a much broader exploration of this question
using self-consistent simulations.  The main result is an enormous range of
possible outcomes.  Depending on the companion and orbital parameters the bar
can be : essentially unaffected or destroyed, reformed in an off-center
configuration, or turned into a lense, ring(s) or bulge on an intermediate
timescale following collision or merger.  Figure 21 shows an example from
Athanassoula, Puerari, and Bosma (1996).  The companion can meet a similar
range of fates as discussed above, though the simulations reported in these
papers had not yet covered a large range of companion parameters.  E.g., all
companion masses are less than 10% of the primary mass.  These models are
especially relevant for the case of multiple collisions (on the way to
merger), where the first collision might generate a bar, whose fate would
depend on details of the subsequent collisions.  So we end this chapter on a
note of great potential complexity. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>5.7.  Intermediate Summary</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The two most important processes that operate on intermediate
timescales, but have long-term consequences, are dynamical friction and bar
formation.  Chandrasekhar's theory of dynamical friction operating on a
massive object traveling through a uniform sea of low-mass stars played an
extremely important role in helping to explain why galaxies merge.  However,
it is too idealized to account for the full range of &quot;frictional&quot;
and collitive phenomena in galaxy collisions.  That is, all fluctuation
phenomena, and the collective effects of resonant orbit interactions.  These
are captured in the perturbative expansion formalism of Tremaine and Weinberg
(1984), and the later papers cited above.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;At the same time that this theory was being developed the importance of
collision-induced bar formation became recognized, largely due to the results
of numerical simulations.  Bar formation requires both a relatively strong
tidal disturbance, and a susceptible region in the center of the galaxy disk,
though there are additional complications.  Induced bars drive enhance star
formation on intermediate timescales, and may contribute significantly to the
net SF of the universe.  Bars drive radial gas flows, and thereby feed active
nuclei, either directly or indirectly.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Tidal tails and collisional shells, which can be drawn out to very
large radii, are other examples of intermediate timescale effects.</P>
