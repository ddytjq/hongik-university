<h1>Wet Marlin wins shortened Pepsi 400</h1>

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A rainy Saturday shined on Sterling Marlin,
who, despite wet weather and an ignition problem, brought home his
third race title at Daytona International Speedway by
winning the rain-shortened NASCAR Pepsi 400. <p>

Marlin was at the front of the field when the red flag came out,
stopping the cars just before the finish line after 117 of the
scheduled 160 laps had been completed.  Marlin led 88 laps,
reasserting himself as the dominant NASCAR performer in
superspeedway races, where restrictor plates are employed to
truncate horsepower. <p>

&quot;I've never walked to victory lane,&quot; said Marlin, the winner of
the Daytona 500 in 1994 and 1995.  &quot;It's kind of weird.  The car
drove great, ran great and everything fell our way.&quot; <p>

Marlin's Chevrolet was clearly the fastest car, and he led for
much of the early going before dropping to 16th when his ignition
shorted out on the 66th lap. He switched to a backup ignition and
slowly worked his way through the pack, regaining the lead for good
on the 87th lap.<p>
	   &quot;I was down in the dumps coasting down through there,&quot; said Marlin, who first thought the engine had blown. Then, when he realized the problem might be the ignition box, he
couldn't locate the switch for the backup.<p>
	   &quot;Sometimes it's on the right, and sometimes it's on the left,&quot; he said. &quot;About halfway down the back straightaway I was looking all over the
dash and finally found it and flipped it over. It started running
and I said, 'We're back in business now.' &quot;<p>

	   With Marlin's crew anticipating the rain, partially because the start of the race had been delayed three hours because of the wet stuff, he stayed on the track
when many drivers pitted on the 102nd lap.<p>
	   &quot;We took a chance,'' crew chief Tony Glover said. &quot;But it's
hard to call your driver in when you're leading the race.''<p>
	   When rain began to fall on lap 117, the caution flag came out
with the leaders on the backstretch, and Marlin blocked Terry
Labonte coming out of Turn 4 to win the sprint back to the
start-finish line. The race was declared final 40 minutes later, making it the first Pepsi 400 shortened by rain in the 38-year
history of the race.<p>
	   Will Marlin have an asterisk next to his name in the record
book?<p>
	   &quot;I don't care,&quot; he said. &quot;The check is going to be the
same.&quot; He won $106,565.<p>
	   &quot;There ain't no two or three cars going to pass that cat unless
his ignition is out like it was there for a while,&quot; said Ken
Schrader, who finished eighth. &quot;That second ignition they've got
is even better than the first one.&quot;<p>

Pole-sitter and defending champion Jeff Gordon, who lost the
lead to Marlin on the first lap, finished third in the 42-car
field. Winston Cup points leader Dale Earnhardt was next, giving
Chevy the top four spots.<p>
	   Ernie Irvan finished fifth in a Ford, and reigning Daytona 500
champion Dale Jarrett took sixth.<p>
	   The race was slowed four times by caution flags. The only wreck
occurred when Dick Trickle brushed the wall in Turn 1, and Kenny
Wallace and Greg Sacks spun out trying to avoid him.<p>
Saturday's finish will further tighten an already close Winston Cup
points race. When official standings are
released Monday, Earnhardt will lead Labonte by five points
and Gordon by 37.
<p> 

The Pepsi 400 marked the midway point of the Winston Cup season,
and Earnhardt will collect a $50,000 bonus for leading the
standings at the halfway mark.
