1977 DODGE ROYAL MONACO
<BR>
360 c.i. engine - paid $25.00
<br>
After a last minute thrash on the carb, fuel line and battery, the car was running good.  
<br>
It had rained all day and the track was extremely muddy.  About 1/2 way into the heat I got a flat 
<br>
rear tire and got stuck in a foot of mud. I got the red flag after a couple of minutes.  
<br>
I tried to get the car ready for the consoltation heat, but couldn't get the engine to turn over.  
<br>
A later investigation found the cause of the problem to be a bad ground
<br>
It wasn't a total loss, as I won $100 for having the best looking car in the derby.
