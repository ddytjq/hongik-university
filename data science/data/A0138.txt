            <li>Stocktrade will provide an execution only dealing service in a 
              range of stocks and shares quoted on the London Stock Exchange. 
              This means that we will not advise you about the merits of a particular 
              transaction and we will not be required to ensure that the transaction 
              is suitable for you. We are not your investment manager and are 
              under no obligation to advise you of any matter affecting your holding 
              and are under no duty to provide you with valuations. The service

              of Stocktrade.<br>

        <li><b> Instructions</b> <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> Orders may be placed between 8.00am - 4.30pm Monday to Friday. 
              The service is not available on bank, or public holidays. We reserve 
              the right to alter these hours without notice.</li>
            <li> Market prices will be provided on request, subject to availability.</li>
            <li> All transactions are entered into entirely at the risk of the 
              client. All telephone instructions may be recorded and all on-line 
              instructions may be retained as evidence of such instructions.</li>
            <li> We will assume that any instructions received in electronic form 
              or over the telephone, which have been authenticated by your username 
              and password, or client code, will be genuine, valid instructions 
              from you and we will act accordingly. You will assume full settlement 
              responsibility for all such transactions. Usernames, passwords, 
              client or account codes must not be disclosed, or be allowed to 
              be disclosed to third parties.</li>
            <li> We may in our absolute discretion and without giving reasons 
              decline to accept any particular instruction or order. If we accept 
              your instructions or orders, we will use reasonable endeavours to 
              carry them out. However, we will not be liable for any loss or expense 
              you incur if we are unable to do so for whatever reason or if there 
              is a delay or change in market conditions before the contract is 
              effected. All such telephone orders will normally be for the earliest 
              practicable execution at the best price obtainable. In certain circumstances, 
              orders passed by telephone may be aggregated with those of other 
              clients for execution. On some occasions this may result in a more 
              or less favourable price than might have been achieved had the order 
              been executed separately.</li>
            <li> If you are 'closing' a bargain you must inform us at the time 
              of dealing. A closing bargain can normally be instructed up to 3 
              days prior to the settlement of the 'opening' transaction.</li>
            <li> In all cases, if you are in doubt about whether an instruction 
              has been received or carried out, you must telephone Stocktrade 
              as soon as is reasonably possible. <br>

        <li><b>Execution</b> <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> We will be responsible for the execution of your orders. Under 
              FSA rules, we are obliged to provide you with &quot;best execution&quot; 
              when executing a transaction for you (meaning the price that is 
              the best available for the customer in the relevant market at the 
              time for the transactions of the kind and size concerned). Clients 
              are advised that, in general, published best execution prices are 
              for transactions arranged with a standard settlement period.</li>
            <li> In the unlikely event that an incorrect bargain price is reported 
              to you, either when your bargain is confirmed or when your contract 
              note issued, we shall be entitled to amend the contract note so 
              that a contract note is issued at the correct price at which the 
              bargain was executed. If in respect of a purchase where the correct 
              price is higher than the price reported to you and there are insufficient 
              funds in your deposit account, stock within your CREST personal 
              account or nominee account may be sold on your behalf and the funds 
              credited to your deposit account. In the case of a sale where the 
              correct price is lower than the initial price reported in error 
              and should you have already instructed us to transfer the sale proceeds 
              to a different bank account, you undertake to reimburse this amount 
              to us immediately. Failure to do so may result in stock held in 
              your CREST personal account or nominee account being sold to cover 
              the debit.</li>
            <li> All relevant stockmarket transactions will be dealt in sterling

          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> Unless otherwise agreed, all transactions are dealt and settled 
              in sterling. Contract notes will confirm execution, will contain 
              the relevant settlement date for all transactions and will act as 
              invoices. Settlement for all sums due (including fees, dividends, 
              market claims, charges and expenses where applicable) to us will 
              be taken from your deposit account unless otherwise agreed. In any 
              event it is a condition that cleared funds must be provided on or 
              before settlement day. Unless otherwise agreed funds due to you 
              will be settled into your deposit account or by BACS to the bank 
              whose details appear on your application form or by cheque (in the 
              name of the account holder only) if requested (we may make a charge 
              for cheque settlements). In respect of cash bargains, funds must 
              be immediately available in the case of purchases. In the case of 
              cash sales, certificates and signed stock transfer forms or renounced 
              documents of title must be available prior to sale. We reserve the 
              right to ask to have such stock in our office before dealing.</li>
            <li> In the event of the delayed delivery of certificate(s) and/or 
              other documents of title and/or appropriate transfer forms duly 
              signed for sales or in the event of late settlement for purchases, 
              we reserve the right to retain relevant documents and/or reverse 
              any outstanding positions and/or charge any loss (including dealing 
              costs) to the client unless a contrary agreement has been made and 
              confirmed in writing. We will charge interest on the outstanding 
              amount at a rate of 3% above the prevailing approved bank base rate 
              and also on any unsettled loss at the same rate. In addition an 
              administration charge may be payable and you will also be required 
              to pay any charges/fines levied by the Stock Exchange or CRESTCo 
              as a result of delayed delivery of certificates etc. We also reserve 
              the right to realise stock held in a CREST personal account, Stocktrade's 
              nominee company name and/or any other nominee company names under 
              the jurisdiction of BDS to settle outstanding positions, but only 
              after due notification to the client by telephone or letter to the 
              address provided by the client to Stocktrade.</li>
            <li> Any correspondence and/or documents of title are dispatched to 
              you by first class post or courier, and to the latest address notified 
              to us by you and at your sole risk. Other than where specified we 
              shall have no responsibility for any failure in delivery to you 
              on the part of the postal system. If within three weeks of the settlement 
              date of your bargain you do not receive a certificate for a purchase 
              and/or a balance certificate in respect of a sale you must telephone 
              Stocktrade immediately. We will accept no responsibility for any 
              non-delivery outside this deadline where our records show the certificate 
              has been dispatched.</li>
            <li> You undertake to ensure that any documents of title, duly signed 
              transfer forms and/or any power of attorney or other document(s) 
              necessary to enable good delivery are delivered to us at least 3 
              business days before the relevant settlement date. Failure to comply 
              with this provision may result in delayed settlement of any sums 
              due to you. Where such documentation is required to be lodged with 
              the relevant company's registrar, settlement may be similarly delayed.</li>
            <li> If you give us a sale instruction for stocks or shares for which 
              a dividend has been paid to you and to which you are not entitled 
              (i.e. you sell 'Cum dividend') you agree to pay us the amount of 
              the dividend on receipt of our request for payment.</li>
            <li> If you give us a sale instruction for stocks or shares with the 
              benefit of a rights, bonus or other entitlement (i.e. 'Cum rights', 
              'Cum bonus' etc.) you undertake to deliver to us all the appropriate 
              documentation. If you do not, you authorise us to purchase the relative 
              holding equivalent to the benefit due and agree to meet the purchase 
              price and any costs or expenses incurred by us in doing so.</li>
            <li> Where the service provision permits, if you effect a transaction 
              for delayed settlement (i.e. where the settlement period is longer 
              than the standard settlement period for that market) the counterparty 
              may levy a charge and any such charge will be reflected in the price 
              shown on the contract note.</li>
            <li> If, at our discretion, you make a purchase for extended settlement 
              we reserve the right at any time to request payment in advance of 
              the settlement date. If you fail to provide such payment within 
              two business days we reserve the right to close the position. However 
              you remain liable for any outstanding costs and payments. Where 
              this event occurs, we will wherever possible but without any obligation 
              use our best endeavours to contact you in advance of closing out 
              such open positions to give you the opportunity to make alternative 
              arrangements.</li>
            <li> Where the service provision permits payment by debit card, your 
              bank or building society account should be debited within two days 
              of the transaction date. You must ensure therefore that cleared 
              funds are available immediately within the account to meet your 
              full liability. If authorisation is not obtained we reserve the 
              right to sell the stock to close the position and you agree that 
              we may debit the costs of such a transaction to your card.<br>

            <li> We may, upon receipt of prior written instruction from you, accept 
              instructions from named third parties to effect transactions on 
              your account or otherwise to deal with the assets forming your account. 
              You will have sole responsibility for and indemnify us against any

        <li><b>Your Money</b> <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> Stocktrade is regulated by the FSA which requires us to keep 
              client money in a separate client account, from our own funds, at 
              an approved bank (as defined in FSA's rules). Stocktrade may at 
              its discretion hold client money with a bank, settlement agent, 
              intermediary broker or OTC counterparty located in a jurisdiction 
              outside the UK. The legal and regulatory regime applying in a jurisdiction 
              outside the UK will be different to that of the UK and in the event 
              of default, client money may be treated differently from the position 
              that would apply if the money was held in a client bank account 
              in the UK.</li>
            <li> Money that we hold on deposit will earn interest at a rate 1% 
              below the approved bank's base rate. If this rate is different from 
              the actual rate earned you will not be disadvantaged. In the event 
              of a default on payment, interest will be charged daily from the 
              due date on the outstanding balance at three percentage points over 
              the prevailing approved bank's base rate. </li>
            <li> Deposit accounts will be held in sterling and any foreign currency 
              received will be converted to sterling at your expense.</li>
            <li>Cash withdrawals from your deposit account will only be made to 
              the bank account number and sort code provided by you on your client 
              application form. Any changes to this data must be provided to us 
              in writing, signed by the relevant registered Stocktrade account 
              holder. Where there is more than one party to the account all parties 
              must sign. Funds requested from recent sales will only be remitted 
              on or subsequent to the settlement date of the sale. Funds placed 
              on deposit can only be remitted to clients once the original deposits 
              have been cleared through the banking system.<br>

            <li> Once paid for, holdings purchased on your behalf will be registered 
              in the name of the account holder and at the address stated in the 
              Application Form or as subsequently advised. However clients who 
              wish to make use of our Nominee facility and/or hold a CREST personal 
              account must sign and return the relevant authorities.</li>
            <li> Safe Custody investments are registered in the name of New Town 
              Nominees Limited, or any of our associated nominee companies, or 
              any other nominee company appointed by us. We accept responsibility 
              for the safe custody obligations of New Town Nominees Limited and 
              any other of our associated nominee companies. Our responsibility 
              does not extend to other custodial organisations, unless any loss 
              is directly due to our fraud, wilful default or negligence.</li>
            <li> There may be other clients of ours with holdings in the same 
              investment through the same nominee company. In this case, the investments 
              may be pooled. This means that whilst the nominee company has full 
              records of the underlying clients' entitlements, these may not be 
              identified by either separate certificates or other documents, or 
              their electronic equivalent. Pooling also means that, were a custodian 
              to default, and this resulted in an irreconcilable shortfall, that 
              shortfall might be divided pro-rata between clients.</li>
            <li> Where we arrange for an investment to be held overseas on your 
              behalf, it may be subject to different settlement, legal and regulatory 
              requirements applying in that country together with differing practices 
              for the separate identification of the investment compared to those 
              in the UK.</li>
            <li> We reserve the right to realise stock held in any BDS group nominee 
              company or in CREST personal accounts and/or any other nominee company 
              names under the jurisdiction of BDS in order to settle any outstanding 
              positions where stock or money is due. This will only be done after 
              due notification to the client by telephone, e-mail or letter to 
              the address provided by the client to Stocktrade.</li>
            <li> When clients instruct holdings to be transferred either into 
              or out of CREST personal accounts, we will effect the transfer as 
              soon as is reasonably practicable. However, clients should be aware 
              that the speed with which transfers are effected once we have issued 
              the initial instruction, lies outside our control and within the 
              control of third parties therefore no guarantees can be given regarding 
              the speed of transfers. </li>
            <li> For nominee clients we shall account to you for all dividends, 
              interest payments and other rights accruing to you. Where there 
              is a cash or stock distribution and the pro-rata value of any fractional 
              entitlement is less than &pound;10 in cash or one share, such fractional 
              elements of cash or stock will not be credited to you or your account 
              and will be retained by us.</li>
            <li> In respect of holdings in our nominee company, we shall act only 
              on your instructions when dealing with take-overs, other offers 
              or capital reorganisations. As we run a pooled nominee we are unable 
              to offer the exercising of voting rights or the election to receive 
              enhanced scrip dividends.</li>
            <li> Clients who hold their stock within an appointed nominee company 
              will be liable for payment of a fee in accordance with our published 
              rates. This may be automatically debited using an existing direct 
              debit instruction or from your deposit account balance without further 
              notification, or by separate request.</li>
            <li> CREST personal accounts are only available to clients who are 
              resident in the EEA. We will account to you for any changes in legislation 
              which pertain to your CREST membership. We reserve the right to 
              vary the administration charge based on trading and account activity. 
              If a CREST personal account has remained inactive for a period of 
              six months and does not hold any securities or have any outstanding

              the amount held in your deposit account plus any sums from sales 
              that are due for settlement prior to the purchase settlement day, 
              or any funds that are authorised on your debit card. If a purchase 
              puts an account in breach of this limit, we reserve the right to 
              reverse the relevant purchase in its entirety without notice. Sales 
              proceeds and purchase considerations will be respectively credited 
              and debited to your deposit account run by us and you will be liable 
              for any resultant losses and costs. Please note the internet system 
              allows you to confirm your deposit account balance.</li>
            <li> If no deals are transacted for a period of six months, any previously

              your exposure to the market. Any collateral requirement, or agreed 
              dealing limit, is for our benefit and does not imply any responsibility

            <li> We may deal for you at your request in respect of:<br>
              i) investments which may be subject to stabilisation. Stabilisation 
              is a price-supporting process that very often takes place in the 
              context of new issues, including rights issues and, in particular, 
              privatisations. It only takes place for a specified period. There 
              are limits on the price at which shares, warrants or depositary 
              receipts may be stabilised but none in respect of loan stock or 
              bonds. Stabilisation can affect the market price of investments 
              of the same class already in issue and of other investments whose 
              price affects the price of the new issue. It takes place in order 
              to ensure that an issue is introduced to the market in an orderly 
              fashion and that the issue price and/or the price of associated 
              investments is not artificially depressed as a result of the increase 
              in supply;<br>
              ii) transactions which commit you to underwriting or similar obligations 
              in connection with a new issue, rights issue, take-over or similar 
              transaction<br>
            </li>
            <li> If you wish to purchase warrants, before passing an instruction 
              to Stocktrade, you are required to sign, and Stocktrade must have 
              received back from you, a Warrant Risk Warning Notice. </li>
            <li> We do not permit &quot;short sales&quot;. You may only give instructions 
              to sell securities which you own or have the right to sell. Instructions 
              will be accepted to sell stocks or shares that you own but have 
              not yet paid for on the basis that the settlement date for the sale 
              is the settlement date of the purchase or later. By giving such 
              instructions you confirm that you beneficially own the securities 
              or are authorised to sell them. All securities sold must be free 
              from any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance. We may (but are not 
              obliged to) ask you for proof of ownership of, or authority to sell 
              securities, and you agree that you will provide such proof within 
              a reasonable length of time. In such circumstances we may delay 
              acting on your instructions until we are satisfied that you have 
              the right to sell the relevant securities. Any sales of securities 
              which you do not own or have authority to sell may be reversed at 
              your expense and any resulting loss will be charged to you. </li>
            <li> Limit orders will be accepted for telephone service clients on 
              a best endeavour basis. We cannot guarantee to deal at your actual 
              price, particularly in fast moving or volatile markets. If you place 
              an order outside &quot;normal market hours,&quot; this will be transacted 
              on the next business day. Limit orders will be good for that business 
              day only and if achieved in that time the deal(s) will be contracted 
              without further reference. Any limits that are not achieved on the 
              same business day will be discarded without further reference.<br>

              not recognised or designated by the Financial Services Authority 
              as meeting certain standards to safeguard investors or not regulated

            <li> If at any time you request and we agree to deal in OEICS, unit 
              trusts or other packaged products, we will do so on an execution 
              only basis and as an independent intermediary. This means that we 
              may purchase, at your request, OEICS or unit trusts from the entire 
              range of available trusts. As an execution only client you will 
              have no right to any cooling-off or cancellation period and we will 
              not be responsible for the suitability of the transaction for you.</li>
            <li> When we deal for you in OEICS or unit trusts there may be a delay

              Contract notes will be sent to you with due despatch once we have 
              received and confirmed the details thereon.<br>

              realisable investments i.e. investments that are not government 
              securities nor listed on an exchange nor regularly traded thereon,

            <li> Your attention is drawn to the fact that when we execute a transaction 
              on your account, we, a connected company or some other person connected 
              with us may have an interest, relationship or arrangement, such 
              as that in section 14.2 below, that is material in relation to the 
              investment or transaction concerned or could give rise to a conflict 
              of interest and you agree that we shall not be required to disclose 
              it to you. However, our employees are required to comply with a 
              policy of independence and disregard any such interest, relationship 
              or arrangement when dealing for you.</li>
            <li> When we enter into a transaction for you we, or one of our connected 
              companies, could be, for example: <br>
              - matching your transaction with that of another client by acting 
              on his behalf as well as yours; <br>
              - buying investments where we, or a connected company are involved

          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> Full details of our charges are set out in the Charges Schedule 
              on our website, our service documentation or by separate agreement. 
              Any alteration to these charges will be notified to you at or before 
              the time of the change. You will also pay any applicable disbursements 
              in respect of VAT, stamp duty, PTM levy and other taxes in respect 
              of all transactions. Any charges due plus any applicable VAT may 
              be deducted from any funds held on your behalf or, at our discretion, 
              shall be paid by you as stated in the relevant contract note or 
              advice note. Although these and certain other fees charged attract 
              VAT, no separate VAT invoices will be issued.</li>
            <li> Charges and expenses are payable on demand and may be deducted 
              from any monies held on your behalf. We also reserve the right to 
              realise stock held in a CREST personal account, Stocktrade's nominee 
              company name or any nominee company name under the jurisdiction 
              of BDS to settle outstanding positions, only after due notification 
              to the client by telephone or letter to the address provided by 
              the client to us.</li>
            <li> We may share dealing charges with our associated companies or 
              other third parties, or receive remuneration from them in respect 
              of such transactions carried out on your behalf. Any such remuneration 
              or sharing arrangements will be referred to on the relevant contract 
              note. Further details can be made available to you on request.<br>

        <li><b> Internet Service - specific provisions</b> <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> The Internet service is an execution-only dealing service in 
              relation to a range of UK company shares and securities that are 
              settled in CREST and are quoted on the London Stock Exchange. The 
              range of securities available may change and will not necessarily 
              cover the full range of stocks quoted on the London Stock Exchange. 
              If you wish to deal in stocks that are not available on the Internet 
              service you may do so through other Stocktrade services designed 
              for that purpose, subject to our agreement. </li>
            <li> Our Internet service allows for orders to be passed and executed 
              online via the Internet. We do not guarantee that live prices and 
              the ability to execute orders online will always be available for 
              the entire range of stocks at all times. Under certain circumstances 
              prices, and the ability to execute orders on-line, may be unavailable 
              for individual stocks or for the entire range of stocks. Under such 
              circumstances if you wish to deal, or obtain prices, you may telephone 
              us.</li>
            <li> An order or instruction effected using the Internet service shall 
              be deemed to be irrevocable once the visual or graphical &quot;Place 
              Order&quot; button or interface has been &quot;clicked&quot; where 
              indicated. We shall act upon any order or instruction so effected. 
              You will assume full settlement responsibility for such orders or 
              instructions or any transactions pursuant to the same. </li>
            <li> By its nature, the Internet is not an entirely reliable medium. 
              Delivery times for messages sent using the Internet vary considerably 
              often depending on your internet service provider, the way in which 
              the message has been routed on the internet and other third party 
              service providers. We or any business connection shall not be liable 
              for any losses, costs, liabilities, claims or expenses arising from 
              any errors or delays that may occur as a result. </li>
            <li> In respect of the Internet service, limit orders will neither 
              be accepted on-line nor by telephone.</li>
            <li> The Internet is not an entirely secure environment. For this 
              reason, despite available means of encryption and privacy protection, 
              we cannot guarantee that any order, message or instruction sent 
              using the Internet will not be capable of being intercepted read 
              or copied by an unauthorised third party or parties. </li>
            <li> You must contact us immediately if you suspect that your username 
              or password has been disclosed to, or obtained by, a third party 
              and that its integrity is threatened. Until such notification is 
              received by us, we will assume that any instructions received in 
              electronic form, or over the telephone, which have been authenticated 
              by your username and password, or client code, will be genuine and 
              valid instructions from you and we will act accordingly. You will 
              assume full settlement responsibility for all such transactions. 
            </li>
            <li> All Internet trades take place within the United Kingdom. </li>
            <li> Settlement of all Internet service transactions will be via deposit 
              accounts, set up for that purpose in advance of dealing.</li>
            <li> Stock purchased through the Internet service will be registered 
              in the name of New Town Nominees Limited or any of BDS' associated 
              nominee companies, or any other nominee company appointed by Stocktrade 
              or may, subject to acceptance, be registered in users names and 
              held electronically in CREST personal accounts. </li>
            <li>The installation and maintenance of all computer hardware, software 
              and communications devices needed by you to use any of our services 
              are solely your responsibility. </li>
            <li> We reserve the right, without notice, to withdraw the online 
              service from clients or to restrict access to the service to particular 
              clients in respect of clients whose dealing behaviour in our sole 
              opinion threatens to disrupt the market or provides other cause 
              for concern. In such circumstances, we shall not be liable for any 
              claims, actions, damages, liabilities, losses, costs or expenses 
              suffered or incurred by you in respect of the withdrawal of the 
              on line service. In such circumstances orders to buy and sell shares 
              can still be passed over the telephone as long as sufficient funds 
              or stock is available within your deposit account or CREST or nominee 
              account. <br>

          <ol>
            <li> Subject to our duties and liabilities under the Financial Services 
              Act 1986 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and FSA 
              rules, we or any business connection shall not be liable for any 
              loss or damage suffered by you in connection with the provision 
              of any services to which this Agreement applies except to the extent 
              that such loss or damage results directly from our negligence, fraud 
              or wilful default.</li>
            <li> You agree to indemnify us against any liability or expense that 
              may be incurred in the proper exercise of our powers and duties. 
              This indemnity will not apply in the case of liability or expense 
              arising from our breach of FSA rules or the Financial Services Act 
              1986 or the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 or our negligence, 
              fraud or wilful default.<br>

            <li> We will not disclose any information about you or your dealings 
              to any third party without your consent, except where it is necessary 
              for the purpose of executing and settling your order or where we 
              are under a legal or regulatory obligation to do so or where in 
              certain circumstances the law says we can do so.</li>
            <li> We may carry out a credit check with a licensed credit reference 
              agency that will retain a record of that search. In the event of 
              default, relevant details may be recorded with that agency and with 
              the Stockbrokers Risk Forum Ltd. This information may be used by 
              other stockbrokers, financial institutions, etc., in assessing applications 
              for credit by you and members of your household, and for occasional 
              debt tracing and fraud prevention purposes. </li>
            <li> We may sometimes use information about you in order to offer 
              you other services that may be of interest to you, both from us 
              and other associated companies or agencies. We will not do so if 
              you have indicated to the contrary on our registration forms, or 
              where there is an agreement with a business connection in place 
              which prohibits this activity. We will cease to use or disclose 
              such information where it is used or is to be used for direct marketing 
              purposes if you have so requested.</li>
            <li> In the event of any default where cash remains due to Stocktrade, 
              we reserve the right to refer this debt at any time and without 
              further notification, to a debt collection agency to recover the 
              funds on our behalf. We also reserve the right, at our absolute 
              discretion, and without further notification, to sell the debt in 
              its entirety to another party.<br>

              arising out of fraud, misappropriation or theft of any client's 
              assets in our custody and control, which includes both cash and

              to give a total insured limit of &pound;50 million.</li>
            <li> We are participants in the UK Investors Compensation Scheme. 
              In the event of our default, compensation may be available from 
              that scheme in respect of our liabilities to you under this Agreement. 
              The maximum compensation payable under that scheme is &pound;30,000 
              plus 90% of the balance of the claim up to &pound;50,000. Further
