<B>Mouse Pointers</b>

The mouse, well we all use it a hell of a lot, and so I don't have to explain what it is or does... I am however going to show you how we can use it in VB, for other then just clicking on things...<Br>
<Br>
<font color="blue">
Moving the mouse with codes<Br>
</font>
<Br>
The mouse has <B>X</b> and <B>Y coordinates</b>, and so every time we move it, they change. We can also do this by code, with <B>API</b> in-fact.<Br>
<Br>
First we have to declare the <B>SetCursorPos Function</b><Br>
<Br>
Declare Function SetCursorPos Lib "user32" Alias "SetCursorPos" (ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long) As Long<Br>
<font color="green">'Declared a function that can set the mouse pointers position on screen</font><Br>
<Br>
After doing so, in a Command button you would write something like the codes below.<Br>
<Br>
S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SetCursorPos 20, 20<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="green">'SetCursorPos X-value, Y-value<Br>
</font>
<Br>
What the code does exactly is move your mouse pointer to the coordinates 20, 20...<Br>
<Br>

Mouse events<Br>
</font>
<Br>
Mouse events such as MouseDown, MouseUp, MouseMove can be very useful in making our programs better. For example, lets say we had a bunch of labels and we wanted it to be easier for the user to see which one he/she currently has the mouse over, we could use the MouseMove event. Each time the user has the pointer over the label, I want it to change color from black to red.<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub Label1_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label1.ForeColor = &HFF&<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<Br>
<Br>
Now the only problem is that when I move the mouse pointer off the label, it's still red. So in the Form's MouseMove event I'll put some code in there to give the label the cool effect...<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub Form_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label1.ForeColor = 0<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<Br>
<Br>
To make my program even fancier, I might go to the Label's properties, put the MousePointer to 99 Custom, and set the MouseIcon to the icon of my choice.<Br>
<Br>

Hiding the Mouse<Br>
</font>
<Br>
What if I was making a game, and didn't need the cursor when I was playing it? API to the rescue! I would need to declare it in my module...<Br>
<Br>
Declare Function ShowCursor Lib "user32" (ByVal bShow As Long) As Long<Br>
<Br>
In my Form's Load even I would put the code to hide the mouse<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub Form_Load()<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShowCursor False<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<Br>
<Br>
When the user would press my game's Exit button, the code to show the mouse (as you all guessed) would look like this...<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub Command1_Click()<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShowCursor True<Br>
<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<Br>
<Br>
