Statistical Summary Tables</a></td>
<td> Retrieve statistical summary data in both color bands for all 
stars within a MACHO Field.  User selects Field. Returns, via ftp, a gzipped
ascii table containing: MACHO star id, RA/Dec, and lightcurve's median 
instrumental mags, error flags, and numerous stats.

Lightcurve Search</a></td>
<td> Lightcurve selection based on bounded region. 
User provides centerpoint RA/Dec and radius. Returns (user defined
number of) lightcurves in closest proximity to the centerpoint. Includes a
web-based lightcurve browser and supports download of lightcurve data.

<td>Variable star lightcurve retrieval.
Allows selection based on RA/Dec, MACHO star id, classification, and various 
statistics.
Includes a web-based lightcurve browser and supports download of
variable star lightcurve data.
<p>
Dataset comprises a subset of the variable stars identified in the MACHO 
lightcurves. </td> </tr>
