Cool. With each version, VB has grown a bit more. 
</P>
<P>Our comfortable old VB "grew up" a bit each time, and embraced each new 
need... XML, MTS, messaging, NT logging... by the time we needed it. But it was 
really, the same old VB we knew and loved. </P>
<P>But everything just changed. The VB we know, the VB we love, the VB we are 
expert in... is dead! Kaput. History. You my friend, the VB6 expert, have no 
advantage over somebody just starting out in programming. </P>
<P>Well, perhaps you'll save a few minutes while they are learning basic VB 
syntax! </P>
<P>That's extreme. But it's the sad reality, and it has many VB programmers 
hopping mad. Others are elated because the last few real quibbles about VB being 
a major league language are gone. </P>
<P>But so is the immediate window, for all intents and purposes. And many other 
things we as VB programmers knew inside out, that made us feel like the experts 
we were (past tense), are gone too. </P>
<P>There's only one thing to do: pick up Dan Appleman's latest book, Moving to 
VB.NET, Strategies, Concepts and Code. </P>
<P>And be prepared: this is no quick read. You might spend a week on a chapter. 
It's not so much about VB, as it is about the CLR, the Common Language Runtime. 
Like every dotnet language, VB.net is nothing but a thin layer of syntax on top 
of the CLR. </P>
<P>Dan does the thorough job we expect him to do with scouting out the VB world 
of the future. Mind you it's full of Appleman foibles: you'll be tired of 
footnotes for one thing! </P>
<P>And use the downloaded code samples, don't bother typing in code from the 
book. It often shows signs of hasty rearrangement and is rarely complete enough 
to use... you often have to read to a future page to understand the code on the 
current page. And although he applauds his managing editor, I think she should 
have cracked his knuckles about some of his excesses a bit more. </P>
<P>But the content is there, and content is what we need. There will be a lot of 
VB.net books that will fail to scratch the surface.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The changes to VB are that much bigger than anything we've seen in VB's 
entire history, we will wait a long time to find a book that has this much 
understanding of the issues out of the gate. </P>
<P>If you really study this book, over the months it truly demands, you will 
learn what you need to know. How the CLR is turning VB inside out and upside 
down. You will learn the new buzzwords that will dominate programmers meetings 
and strategies: Assemblies, versioning, serialization (all new), reflection, 
threading, delegates. </P>
<P>But time's awasting, those newbies are reading this book already. You are not 
going to be able to fake it this time, buy this book! </P></TD></TR></Table><Table width='100%' border=1 cellpadding=5><TR><TD  id=RevTitle><FONT color=navy size=6>Appleman is a Good First Guide to Our New World</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD id=RevAuthor >Reviewed By:  <a name=DaveLatimer><A href='Reviewer.asp?Rid=6&ISBN=1893115976' >Dave Latimer</a></TD></TR><TR><TD id=Review><P>
Daniel Appleman has built a reputation around the thoroughness of his Windows 
API for Visual Basic books. He builds on that reputation with Moving to VB.NET: 
Strategies, Concepts, and Code.
<br><br>
Besides being thorough, I found Mr. Appleman to be very straightforward and 
honest in his writing. With so much marketing hype and so many competing 
ideologies in today’s I.T. world, this is a big deal for me. Because of this, 
reading his introduction is a very good indication of where he stands, where 
the book stands and what his goals are in writing the book. He takes the 
unusual step of stating his position on Microsoft. I find too much of my 
reading time is spent figuring out whether the writer is a blind MS follower or 
basher. It doesn’t say much about the state of our industry that this section 
is necessary, but I found it to be refreshing and helpful.
<br><br>
The book, he says, is for intermediate to advanced programmers. This is true. 
Though there are plenty of code samples (available on the web, not in a CD), 
the book is more of a high-level, strategic/conceptual look (as the name 
implies) at VB.NET. Mr. Appleman acts as our first tour guide to the .NET 
world. He also makes a reasonable case that he didn’t just write this book to 
cash in with an early-to-market book based on a beta product, but also to 
provide guidance and direction for VB6 programmers coming to VB.NET. “That’s 
main reason I want to get this book out early — because I want to help VB 
programmers get started off correctly.” When dealing with a very large topic, 
this kind of focus is a prerequisite for a good book.
<br><br>
In ways, for me, it was almost too focussed. Mr. Appleman assumed his reader 
had worked only in VB. This is almost a necessary assumption, but it made some 
sections of the book less compelling for me. There was a little more time spent 
on inheritance, for example, than would be necessary for someone who has done 
object-oriented programming. Still, it was a good review and had some new and 
interesting takes based on the .NET implementation of inheritance. I found the 
rest of the book to be filled with insights and caveats very important to a new 
VB.NET developer.
<br><br>
Moving to VB.NET is a well-written guide to VB6 programmers moving into the 
VB.NET world.
