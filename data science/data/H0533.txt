<b>2002 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>Propagation and Purpose:  Parables from Complex Systems and Their Possible Meanings for Our Lives</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> J. Doyne Farmer, McKinsey Professor, Santa Fe Institute<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 24, 25, & 26, 2002<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> TBA
</p>
<p>
In 1950, John von Neumann said that "science and technology will shift from a past emphasis on motion, force, and energy to communication, organization, programming, and control."   He was right. This has happened in almost every field of science and engineering, and has had a huge effect on the way we communicate, do business, and even entertain ourselves. But at a more fundamental level, we are slowly gaining a better (if still fragmentary) understanding of how the material properties of the world give rise to its informational properties.  While the universe becomes in one sense more random, it also becomes in another sense more orderly.  Patterns spontaneously emerge, grab energy, rearrange, compete, and perform complex tasks such as prediction of their environments, for the purpose of better propagating themselves through time.  People and their societies are of course just one example. Professor Farmer will argue that viewing ourselves in the context of the broader organizational process of which we are a part can shed a little light on our beliefs and institutions, and our relation to the universe.

<b>2001 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>The Scale of the Tree of Life from Molecules and Cells to Whales and Ecosystems</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> Geoffrey West, Los Alamos National Laboratories<br>
<b>Dates:</b> October 30, 31, &amp; November 1, 2002<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> TBA
</p>
<p>
Life is the most complex physical system in the Universe. It is manifested in an extraordinary diversity of forms, functions, and behaviors ranging over a remarkable mass scale of a billion million fold from the smallest microbes (mycoplasma) to the largest animals (whales) and plants (sequoias). In spite of this, many of life's most fundamental and seemingly most complex attributes scale with size in a surprisingly simple fashion. The basic idea is that, driven by natural selection, life at all scales is sustained by hierarchical fractal-like branching network  systems whose universal characteristics determine many of the generic properties of living organisms. Examples include the macroscopic cardiovascular, respiratory and neural systems of mammals, the interconnectedness of an ecosystem, and the  microscopic pathways within mitochondria. Functionally,  biological systems are ultimately limited by the rates at which energy, materials, and information can be supplied through these networks. This set of lectures explored and developed these ideas as a unified vision for viewing many phenomena from which hierarchical structures have evolved.

<b>2000 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>The Brain as a Complex System</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> Chuck Stevens, Professor, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Santa Fe Institute Science Board Member<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 19, 20, & 21, 2000<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> An agreement between SFI and Prof. Stevens waived a book for these lectures.
</p>
<p>
The brain is one of the most complex of the complex adaptive systems known.  The goal of these lectures was to review what features make a system complex, to summarize facts about the brain (its development and function), and to survey insights about the brain provided by viewing it as a complex system. 
</p>
<p>
The essence of complex systems is that they possess emergent properties, often quite complicated ones, that arise from the cooperative interactions between much simpler constituent components.  The brain is, in many regards, a perfect example of this scheme.  When the brain develops in a baby, each of the billions of neurons must find its right place in the brain and make just the right connections to thousands of other neurons.  The enormously complicated structure of the brain must emerge through simple interactions between its billions of components, the nerve cells. 
</p>
<p>
After the basic structure of the brain is formed, it must modify this structure by experience, and here too the final result must emerge from the interactions of individual neurons following their own simple rules.  Finally, as the brain functions, the complicated patterns of neuronal activity that constitute thought must arise from simple functional interactions between individual neurons. 
</p>
<p>
The lectures gave examples of the simple rules neurons follow and explained how complex properties that characterize our brain emerge from them.

<b>1999 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>The Regular and the Random</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> Murray Gell-Mann, Distinguished Fellow, Santa Fe Institute<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 21, 22, & 23, 1999<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> Murray is working on a book proposal.  He will be working through his agent to select a publisher.
</p>
<p>
Nearly everything we encounter exhibits regularities along with random or incidental features.  All around us we find superpositions of law and chance--or signal and noise, as in the case of music and static on the radio.	
</p>
<p>
Over the course of three evenings, Professor Murray Gell-Mann discussed these contrasts as they apply to a wide variety of systems, ranging from the universe as a whole to living organisms and human culture, with reference to topics that included bird song, barbarian coinages, codes and ciphers, abstract images in the visual arts, and the evolution of human languages.	
</p>
<p>
He examined the meanings and relevance of concepts such as complexity, entropy, and individuality and presented examples of regularities like self-similarity--or "scaling"--that are widespread in physical and biological science and in human affairs.
</p>
<p>
<b>1998 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>The New Economy</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> W. Brian Arthur, Citibank Professor, Santa Fe Institute<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 15, 16, & 17, 1998<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> No publisher has been selected. Manuscript still in progress.
</p>
<p>
As this millennium gives way to the next, the economy is undergoing a deep change.  It is shifting steadily away from the brute force of manufacturing into the forces of mind--from the processing of bulk materials into the processing of digital representations.  This change has been much written about and much discussed in the press.  In these three lectures, Arthur argued that the new economy overturns our old understandings.  It redefines what we understand by products.  It redefines markets.  It creates new structures.  The modernist interpretation of the economy fails.  Standard economic theory no longer applies.  And the new technologies paradoxically lead to a less mechanistic, more organic economy.

<b>1997 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>The Past and Future of the Sciences of Complexity</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> Melanie Mitchell, Director, SFI Adaptive Computation Program, Santa Fe Institute<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 16, 17, &amp; 18, 1997<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> Book to be published by Oxford University Press.  Plans to submit final manuscript the end of 2002.
</p>
<p>
Lecture 1:  "What Are the 'Sciences of Complexity' and Where Did They Come From?"  
</p>
<p>
Lecture 2:  "Can Complex Systems Approaches Lead to Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life?" 
</p>
<p>
Lecture 3:  "Dreams of a Unified Theory:  What General Principles Will the Sciences of Complexity Uncover?"
</p>
<p>
In recent years, much attention has been paid to a collection of scientific efforts now known as the "sciences of complexity." These efforts are bringing together ideas from many disciplines in order to discover general laws governing systems of great complexity and with powers of self-organization, such as the brain, the immune system, global economies, biological evolution, and increasingly "life-like" computer systems.  The field of complex systems is being claimed by some to be the likely locus of the next great conceptual  revolution in our scientific understanding of nature.	
</p>
<p>
These lectures traced the intellectual history of these efforts, including the cross-disciplinary pioneering work of figures such as John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, and Stanislaw Ulam himself, and explained how the recent accomplishments and future prospects of complex systems research are deeply grounded in this early work.  These lectures focused in depth on links  between current and early work, as well as on the prospects for revolutionary new discoveries and paradigms from the sciences of complexity.

<b>1996 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>Fragile Dominion: Complexity and the Commons</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> <a href="http://eno.princeton.edu/%7Esimon/">Simon Levin</a>, Princeton University<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 10, 11, &amp; 12, 1996<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> Levin, Simon. <i>Fragile Dominion.</i> Reading, MA: Perseus Books, 1999.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who missed the lectures, here is an excerpt from the Perseus Books catalog:
</p>
<p>
"In <i>Fragile Dominion</i>, ecologist Simon Levin illuminates the fascinating relationships among ecology, evolution, complexity, and biodiversity. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the past, present, and future of life on this planet."
--Murray Gell-Mann
</p>
<p>
We all know that our planet is losing its biological diversity at an alarming rate, with frightening implications for our future. But when does an ecosystem hit the breaking point? In this important book, Princeton biologist Simon Levin offers general readers the first look at how the new science of complexity can help to solve our looming ecological crisis. Levin argues that our biosphere is the classic embodiment of what scientists call complex adaptive systems. By exploring how such systems work, we can determine how they might fail. How much loss can an ecosystem bear before it starts to collapse? How resilient are these systems in general? Do they in fact hover at the edge of disaster? A deeply original work on one of the pressing issues of our time, <i>Fragile Dominion</i> is a powerful appeal to understand and protect the global "commons."
</p>


<p>
<b>1995 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>Warriors Within: How Your Immune System Combats Disease</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> Alan Perelson, Los Alamos National Laboratory<br>
<b>Dates:</b> September 12, 13, &amp; 14, 1995<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> Book withdrawn by author.
</p>
<p>
Alan Perelson's work in theoretical immunology focuses on bridging the gap between experimental findings in immunology and their interpretation with the aim of forming a coherent picture of how the immune system functions. Using ideas from mathematics, physics, and chemistry as well as computers, his approach brings tools from the sciences of complexity to bear on immune system problems such as autoimmune diseases like allergies, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, the possible actions of HIV in causing AIDS, and a number of fundamental features of the immune system.
</p>

<p>
<b>1994 Ulam Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b> <i>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity</i><br>
<b>Presented by:</b> John H. Holland<br>
<b>Dates:</b> June 6, 7, &amp; 8, 1995<br>
<b>Publication notes:</b> Holland, John H. <i>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity.</i> Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1994.
</p>
<p>
How does a disease such as AIDS manage to destroy the immune system? How does a city like New York or Tokyo manage to deliver food, medicine, clothing, and other essentials to millions of inhabitants without breaking down? The functioning of such immensely complex systems remains a mystery. But through his work at the Santa Fe Institute and at the University of Michigan, John Holland and his coworkers now stand on the threshold of a solution.
