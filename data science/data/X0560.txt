<hr size=2 color=#000000>
      <p>by Steve MacKinney</p>

        <p>There is one ball and five players so on average, you spend 80% of the time on offense
        playing without the ball.  While playing without the ball, you should try to accomplish
        these things:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Get open under the basket</li>
        <li>Help a team mate get open under the basket</li>
        <li>Get open away from the basket</li>
        <li>Get a team mate open away from the basket</li>
        <li>Pull a defensive player away from the basket to open space for a teammate</li>
        <li>Create a mismatch of size, quickness, or ability by forcing the defense to switch</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most of this chapter applies more to man-to-man defense than zones, but many of the
        techniques will work against either defense.</p>

        <p><b>How to Get Open</b></p>

        <p>We teach five ways to get open:</p>

      <b><a name="Moving to open space">Moving to open space</a></b> usually starts with a slight push (push with the back of your
        hand) off the defensive player and two or three quick steps away from the defense toward an
        open area where the passer can pass to you <i>(diagram 1)</i>. Give the passer a target by holding
        your open hand out on the side away from your defender.  The passer should throw ahead of you
        so you and the ball arrive at the spot at the same time.

        pass by playing you tight or playing in the passing lane (in between you and the passer).
        You should take two or three quick steps toward the basket to get the defender moving with
        you.  Go all the way to the lane in case the passer thinks he can get the ball to you and
        attempts the pass.  When you get close enough to the basket to be sure the passer is not going
        to throw the ball, quickly plant your foot and cut back away from the basket to the spot where
        you want to receive the pass. Give a target as explained above. Sometimes if the defender is
        really close when you get ready to plant your foot and cut away for the pass, you can reverse
        pivot into the defender and give him a little bump with your butt to keep him from staying with
        you as you move out into the open.

        <p><b><a name="Back door cuts">Back door cuts</a></b> (or back cuts) <i>(diagram 3)</i>&nbsp; take advantage of a defender who is trying to keep you
        from getting open.  Usually you will start the back cut by moving into open
        space with a defender moving with you. To signal to the passer that you are going to back cut,
        hold out a closed fist instead of an open hand as a target.  The passer should fake a pass to
        you to try to get the defender to focus on the ball and lunge into the passing lane.  Plant
        your outside foot (when facing the passer, the foot furthest from the basket) and quickly cut
        toward the basket and look for a pass.  A bounce pass is usually best because the defender will
        try to step back toward the lane to deflect the pass and a bounce pass will get under his hand.
        If the passer is dribbling toward the cutter when the cutter starts his back cut, he can pass
        with one hand (dribble pass) and put back spin on the ball so when it bounces, it slows and
        bounces up making it easier for the receiver to catch. When receiving a back cut pass, expect
        another defender to be coming to the basket and be ready to dish off to his man, fake the dish
        and take the ball up yourself, or just go up strong and score anyway.

        <p><a name="Sealing (ducking in)"><b>Sealing (ducking in)</b></a> is effective close to the basket to keep the defender from
        deflecting a pass to you.  You simply duck under the defender's arm which is denying the pass
        to you. Step across in front of the defender and lean back on him and stick your elbow straight
        out to the side so it blocks the defender from getting around in front of you. Stick your other
        hand out and ask for the ball.  This is especially useful against zone defenses since the
        defense is usually focused on the ball and playing in front of the receiver.

        <p>Another way to seal a defender is to move up to him face to face and then reverse pivot
        into him and lean back on him. After setting a screen, try to seal the man you screened
        by reverse pivoting in front of him when he tries to go around you. Then step toward the
        basket keeping the defender behind you and ask for the ball.</p>

        <p><b>Screening - How to help team mates get open</b></p>

        <p>Unselfish players are just as happy to get their team mate open for a shot as they are
        when they score themselves. Thank the player who got you open with a screen just as you
        thank the passer after an assist. The irony of setting screens to get your teammates open
        is that the screener is often the one who scores because the defense switches to cover the
        cutter. Unselfish play and good communication is what makes the difference between being a
        team and just being five players.</p>

        <p>Communication is important in screening just as it is when running a back door cut.
        We use a raised fist to signal that we are going to set a screen. That keeps the passer
        from bouncing the ball off the screener's face and lets the cutter know that he should
        start running his man into the screen. You can also call out the name of the cutter as
        you go to set a screen for him or point to where you want him to cut by you.

        <p><a name="Using a screen">Using a screen</a> is very effective for getting open and for creating mismatches by forcing
        the defense to switch (the screener's defender covers the cutter so the cutter's defender
        takes the screener - they "switch" men).  By having the smallest, quickest player screen
        for the tallest player and forcing their defenders to switch, you can make their smallest
        player defend your tallest one and force their tallest player to defend your quickest one.
        Once they switch, stay spread out enough so it is hard for them to switch back.</p>

        <p>There are several kinds of screens you can use:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="#Back screens">Back screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Down screens">Down screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Down screens">Ball screen</a> (pick)</li>
        <li><a href="#Horizontal screens">Horizontal screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Flare screen">Flare screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Double screen">Double screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Double screen">Staggered screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Double screen">Slip (fake) screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Yo-yo screen">Yo-yo screen</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also use:
        <ol>
        <li>Another cutter as a screen
        <li>Another player's defender as a screen
        <li>A post player who has the ball as a screen.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The technique is similar for most screens. You should look for the cutter's defender
        (call him "CD") and get between him and the spot the cutter (C) is going to. Get as close
        to CD as is legal - an inch if CD can see you, about 30 inches if CD cannot see you like
        on a back screen. You (the screener) must be stopped when the contact takes place. Once
        contact is made, you should be ready to reverse pivot whichever direction CD tries to go
        around and seal CD behind him. Then you can step towards the basket looking for a pass.</p>

        <p>The cutter is responsible for influencing his defender (CD) into the screener, either
        with fakes or subtle pushing with the back of his hand or his arm.  The cutter should go
        very close to the screener (we tell them to rub shoulders) so CD cannot force his way
        between them. He should continue his cut several steps past the screener to force the
        screener's defender to go with him, leaving the screener open (if the screener is able
        to seal CD).  The cutter will often get open against poor defensive teams and the screener
        will get open against the better teams if he seals properly.</p>

        first cutter (or into the first cutter's defender) and it is extremely hard to defend.
        We try to have the first cutter start low and cut to the high post while a second cutter

      <p>Another way to use a cutter as a screen is to have a high post with the ball
        and have a guard cut under him diagonally from the right guard position toward the left
        baseline corner <i>(diagram 12)</i>. As the guard and his man go by, the post player drives
        right and forces his man into the cutter or the cutter's defender.</p>

      <p>When a post player has the ball along the side of the lane or at the free throw line,
        a cutter can start high and run his man into the post player by cutting above the post
        and then continuing toward the basket <i>(diagram 13)</i>. If the defender tries to go under
        the post, the cutter can stop and shoot from behind the post player. If the post player
        is on the block, a player on the wing can "dive" down and run to the baseline side of the
        post player and often be open when he comes out on the other side, but the post player
        may get double-teamed by the cutter's defender and not be able to make the pass.</p>

        <p><b>Removing the Help</b> - Pulling a defender away from the basket</p>
        <p>When your defender is the "help" man and is playing off you to help defend under the
        basket, you need to take advantage of it. Flashing (cutting toward the passer)
        <i>diagram 14)</i> to the high post will usually allow you to catch and then pass inside
        before the low post's defender can get around him to deny the pass. You can also do a
        quick spin move from the high post and drive down across the lane for a lay up if your
        defender tries to deny the pass on the low side because there is no help behind you.</p>

        <p>When a team mate drives and your man is going to help, step away from your man to give
        the driver an open passing lane and get your hands ready to catch a bounce pass.</p>

        <p><b>Spacing</b></p>
        <p>When two offensive players stand too close to each other, it allows the defense to
        double team quickly and to help. Try to stay at least 12 - 15 feet away from team mates
        except when cutting and screening to spread the defense out and allow some space for
        one-on-one moves.</p>
        <p><b>Spacing against full court pressure</b></p>
        <p>Most pressure defenses will try to double team the ball and cover the other four
        offensive players with three defenders. If the offensive players are spread out, it is
        harder for three defenders to cover them. If potential receivers are so far away from the
        passer that he can't throw to them without a defender getting there first, they aren't
        helping.  </p>

      <td width="340" valign="top" align="left">

      <p>Against full court pressure defense <i>(diagram 15 shows a typical diamond press)</i>,
        spacing of 30 - 50 feet is close enough for the passer to throw to you quickly but spread
        out enough to make it hard for one defender to cover two men. Cutting toward the passer
        and going to meet the pass keeps defenders from coming from behind to steal the pass.
        Catching the ball in the middle of the floor gives you 360 degrees to pass to but the
        sidelines only give you 180 degrees and the corner only gives you 90.  When you catch
        in the middle, look to the opposite side because presses usually are moving toward the
        ball leaving the other side open.</p>
