I realize that electrical engineering is far removed from biology and philosophy, but it does give me a formal training in a complex topic, and has provided some intuitive insights.</P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Scientific Interests:</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> I have always followed science, mainly physics, cosmology, and evolution. I used evolution for defending science prior to studying the technical issues. I never questioned that evolution might be an incomplete theory, or that there were doctrinaire divisions within the science. I became engaged in details of evolution once I was already forming a hypothesis on human evolution and behavior. I then wondered if factors operating in human evolution, which could explain it, might operate since the beginning of life. This has led to my </FONT><A HREF="THEORY.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">New Model of Evolution</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">, which will be much debated. </P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Seeking Explanations:</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> My views have always been secularist and rational, but have evolved. I was never content to explain love, say, as chemical attraction and regard such simplistic views as explaining nothing. Although my interest in human behavior began from an ideological (Left wing) concerns, I now reject all ideology as also too simplistic. If a scientist espouses misleading views (of human behavior) it is not from ideological motive. Rather, this is a complex science. So people settle on a model that they feel provides reasonable answers, even if that model is incomplete, or appears erroneous to promoters of an alternative model. Although I am disappointed people have not tried harder to understand my own theory, I do not detect any ideological resistance to it. Just people think they already have models that will work, and are not prepared to confront how complex the problem is.</P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Philosophy:</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> My early views were socialistic, with a view that materialism (see </FONT><A HREF="A44mind.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">4.4 Mind and the Universe</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">) was a commitment to science. I was somewhat shattered on carefully reading Ayer's "Language, Truth and Logic". I disagreed (and still do) with Ayer's moral views. But I was technically astute enough to see that all equations are tautologies (see </FONT><A HREF="A14facts.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">1.4 Facts, Theories, and Options</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">), so all laws of thought must be in some way fictions. On the other hand, after stultifying Marxist 'we know it all' Ayer's views struck me as genuine philosophical challenge, which I was determined to address. My new theory explains that we categorize knowledge into its analytical and empirical components because it maximizes the versatility of knowledge. Yet, humans still must make choices, including moral ones, over any form of knowledge they confront. I can demonstrate that while we can arrive at these conclusions by a process of reason, the brain evolved to also optimize knowledge that way, by a natural process independent of reason. (Also see </FONT><A HREF="philos.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">Philosophy Page</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">.)</P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Scientific Truth</U>:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> Like secularism, or evolution, one's understanding of scientific truth does not alter in principle, but evolves as we confront deeper scientific quandaries. An asteroid breaks apart but its pieces maintain coincident trajectories after separation, and we think we understand why. Yet when living beings branch into separate species, some DNA sequences also retain coincident trajectories from before the split occurred. We could explain this as a property of the sequences to self-perpetuate, but selected sequences retain tighter trajectories than non-selected ones, which is an effect of phenotype fitness. So we approach in biology a situation akin to physics, where each model explains a deeper aspect of the problem, but none is a final truth. Synthesis is when we can show two seemingly contradictory models describe different aspects of the same process. In human behavior we seek a synthesis of psychology with evolutionary biology. In evolution we seek a synthesis of gene flow with "punctuated" macro features of the fossil record. My theories achieve partial synthesis within the limits of the models, but full synthesis (say, between gene flow and psychology) is not practicable. </P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Moral Outlook</U>:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> Most people (throughout history) have some religious influence on their upbringing. Later, when they confront the moral realities of life, they find the religious explanation inadequate. So, they then produce a theory of why there is no scientific foundation to religious moral teachings. My own upbringing was largely non-religious, but my strong experience was that does not expunge individuals from confrontation with moral dilemma. There is a moral experience to being human, of which religious morality is one explanation, but not the primal cause of why humans feel this way. In this sense, there has never been an adequate secular explanation of the human moral expedience. Again, my own theory confronts this problem directly. I believe I have found the best secular explanation of human moral dilemma within current knowledge. </P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>My Theories:</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> The modern theory of evolution is not only intellectually difficult, but is highly specialized technically. While human behavior, such as a theory of morality, has never been fully explained anytime in history, by the greatest minds. So the odds against an individual not formally trained in either disciple producing original solutions in both evolution <U>and</U> human behavior must be greater than the odds stacked against life itself evolving from non-life! Yet despite such odds against it, there are reasons I have confidence in my theories.</P>
<OL>

<U><LI>95% (more like 99%) is already known:</U> Despite being original, only a very small part of my theories is different from what is already accepted. My theories are syntheses of the correct way to reconcile existing, but seemingly contradictory models, rather anything different from current ideas. </LI>
<U><LI>The 5% (or 1%) that is new is totally new</U>: If 99% is known, the missing concepts must be either "queerer than we can suppose" (like 1 + 1 </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">¹</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> 2) or so obvious to be "stupid not to have thought of it myself". My theories (like evolution was) are simple and elegant once explained, but very hard to work out the first time.</LI>
<U><LI>This is the only explanation that makes lasting sense:</U> Despite claims, theories of sociobiology or "evolutionary" psychology cannot, and never will explain human complexity. (They are not even good theories of evolution. Do we explain suicide by a "suicide" gene?) The new theory comfortably explains all human evolution as simple, direct, individual fitness. But for reasons explained, this fitness yields a psychologically motivated, complex behavior, within its evolved social context.</LI>
<U><LI>This is the only explanation that insists on a correct theory of knowledge</U>: The point seems pedantic. But ultimately, we must explain how the brain works using the brain we have (the brain we evolved with). For this, we must know at least one thing true in the universe regardless of how the brain evolved. (Then we will know why it evolved!) No other explanation makes this point. (But conversely, no other theory can explain why the human brain is so large or evolved the way it did.) </LI>
<U><LI>This is the only explanation with a believable moral theory:</U> All through history, people believe what they believe, rational or not. But one cannot, on rationalist grounds alone, propose a moral theory if it fails to explain genuine human emotions (like love, hate, fear, belief, etc.). The new theory offers perhaps the most rationally complex explanation of morality ever proposed. Yet once explained, it will meet people's ordinary expectations of how deep inner feelings might best be accounted for in a common sense way. </LI></OL>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#808000"><P><A NAME="Electrical">Electrical Engineering</A></U>:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> As agreed, this discipline is far removed from biology and philosophy. But I am the first to reject unsubstantiated claims about so-called electric fields in biology, or crude analogies to the 'wiring' of the human brain. (See my essay </FONT><A HREF="A42wire.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">4.2 The 'Wiring' of the Brain</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">. I also define fields in <A NAME="Boundary"></A></FONT><A HREF="NICHE.htm#Boundary"><FONT FACE="Arial">3.2 The "Boundary" of a Species</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">.) On the other hand, electrical engineering deals extensively in Boolean logic, vector spaces, phase shifts, complex arithmetic, stability, feedback, step functions, computer logic and maximization. My math for this is not as good as it should be, but I work comfortably with the concepts. It is said that the great inventor Thomas Edison could not go from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) because he could not understand the math. Perhaps I can redress the balance. Because I am already familiar with the concepts, I might spot an instance of their application in topics far removed from the discipline. (I do not totally reject the notion of electric effects in biology, only it is a subject that we know few facts about. Yet there are other major issues in evolution that we can resolve right now with facts we already have, so we stick to these.)</P>
