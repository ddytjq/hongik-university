  <PRE>  1. After long discussion, the Local Council voted on three
      motions, A, B and C. In the following day's newspapers
      one journalist reported "Only motion C was defeated",
      another reported "Only B and C were carried", while a
      third, who had gone home before the third vote, reported
      simply that "A and B were carried". Furthermore, one of
      the three journalists had lost his notes, and reported
      incorrectly. Which motions were carried?

  2. From a class of 33 students, 16 passed their Maths exam, 19
      passed their Physics exam, and 5 failed both. How many
      passed both? 

  3. Thirty people, from England, France and Germany, attended
      an international conference. Of these, 16 could speak
      only their native language, but 7 could speak both
      English and French, 6 spoke English and German, and 5
      spoke French and German. How many spoke all three languages?
