Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
</H1>

<P>
Gamow, Alpher and Herman proposed the hot Big Bang as a means to produce
all of the elements.  However, the lack of stable nucei with atomic
weights of 5 or 8 limited the Big Bang to producing hydrogen and helium.
Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle worked out the nucleosynthesis
processes that go on in stars, where the much greater density and longer
time scales allow the triple-alpha process 
(He+He+He -&gt; C) to proceed and make the elements heavier than helium.
But BBFH could not produce enough helium.  Now we know that both processes
occur: most helium is produced in the Big Bang but carbon and everything 
heavier is produced in stars.  
Most lithium and beryllium is produced by cosmic
ray collisions breaking up some of the carbon produced in stars.

The following stages occur during the first few minutes of the Universe:

Less than 1 second after the Big Bang, the reactions shown at right
maintain the neutron:proton ratio in thermal equilibrium.  About 1
second after the Big Bang, the temperature is slightly less than the
neutron-proton mass difference, these weak reactions become slower than
the expansion rate of the Universe, and the neutron:proton ratio
<EM>freezes out</EM> at about 1:6.

After 1 second, the only reaction that appreciably changes the number of
neutrons is neutron decay, shown at right.  
The half-life of the neutron is 615 seconds.
Without further reactions to
preserve neutrons within stable nuclei, the Universe would be pure hydrogen.
</TD><TD>
<IMG SRC="./BBNS-neutron-decay.gif" WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=26 HSPACE=5>
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
The reaction that preserves the neutrons is deuteron formation.
The deuteron is the nucleus of deuterium, which is the
heavy form of hydrogen (H<SUP>2</SUP>).
This reaction is exothermic with an energy difference of 2.2 MeV, but since
photons are a billion times more numerous than protons, the reaction does
not proceed until the temperature of the Universe falls to 100 billion K
or kT = 0.1 MeV, about 100 seconds after the Big Bang.
At this time, the neutron:proton ratio is about 1:7.
</TD><TD>
<IMG SRC="./BBNS-deuteron-formation.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=26 HSPACE=5>
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Once deuteron formation has occured, further reactions proceed to make
helium nuclei.
Both light helium (He<SUP>3</SUP>) and normal helium (He<SUP>4</SUP>)
are made, along with the radioactive form of hydrogen (H<SUP>3</SUP>).
These reactions can be photoreactions as shown here.
Because the helium nucleus is 28 MeV more bound than the deuterons,
and the temperature has already fallen so far that kT = 0.1 MeV, these
reactions only go one way.
</TD><TD>
<IMG SRC="./BBNS-photo-formation.gif" WIDTH=219 HEIGHT=158 HSPACE=5>
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
The reactions at right also produce helium and usually go faster since
they do not involve the relatively slow process of photon emission.
</TD><TD>
<IMG SRC="./BBNS-alpha-formation.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=158 HSPACE=5>
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
The net effect is shown at right.
Eventually the temperature gets so low that the electrostatic repulsion
of the deuterons causes the reaction to stop.  The deuteron:proton
ratio when the reactions stop is quite small,
and essentially inversely proportional
to the total density in protons and neutrons.
Almost all the neutrons in the Universe end up in normal helium nuclei.
For a neutron:proton ratio of 1:7 at the time of deuteron formation,
25% of the mass ends up in helium.

The mass fraction in various isotopes vs time is shown at right.
Deuterium peaks around 100 seconds after the Big Bang, and is then rapidly
swept up into helium nuclei.
A very few helium nuclei combine into heavier nuclei giving a small abundance
of Li<SUP>7</SUP> coming from the Big Bang.
This graph is a corrected version of one from this
<A HREF="http://aether.lbl.gov/WWW/tour/elements/early/early_a.html">LBL
page</A>.
Note that H<SUP>3</SUP> decays into He<SUP>3</SUP> with a 12 year half-life
so no H<SUP>3</SUP> survives to the present, and Be<SUP>7</SUP> decays into
Li<SUP>7</SUP> with a 53 day half-life and also does not survive.

The graph above shows the time evolution of the abundances of the light
elements for a slightly higher baryon density.  This is based
on data from <A HREF="http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9903300">
Burles, Nollett &amp; Turner (1999)</A>.
The asymptotic D/H ratio [by number] is 1.78*10<SUP>-5</SUP>
which corresponds to Omega<SUB>B</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.029.
This best current estimate is Omega<SUB>B</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.019.

The deuterium, He<SUP>3</SUP>, He<SUP>4</SUP> and Li<SUP>7</SUP> abundances
depend on the single parameter of the current density of ordinary matter
made out of protons and neutrons: baryonic matter.  The graph above shows
the predicted abundance vs. baryon density for these light isotopes as
curves, the observed abundances as horizontal stripes, and the derived
baryon density as the vertical stripe.
A single value of the baryon density fits 4 abundances simultaneously.
