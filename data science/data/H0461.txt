Health: Human Genome Project </B></a>

Washington, DC 20005

<p>Recent literacy surveys have found that a large
number of adults lack the skills to bring meaning
to much of what is written about science. This, in
effect, denies these adults access to vital
information about their health and well-being. To
address this  need, the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has
developed a 2-year project to provide low-literate
adults with the background knowledge necessary to
address the social, ethical, and legal implications
of the Human Genome Project. 


<p>With its Science + Literacy for Health: Human
Genome Project, AAAS used its existing network
of adult education providers and volunteer science
and health professionals to pursue the following
overall objectives: (1) to develop new materials for
adult literacy classes, including a high-interest
reading book, a short video providing background
information on genetics, a database of resources,
and fact sheets to assist other organizations and
researchers in preparing easy-to-read materials
about the HGP, and (2) to develop and conduct a
campaign to disseminate the materials to libraries
and community organizations carrying out literacy
programs throughout the United States. To
introduce the materials to low-literate adults,
workshops using the materials were conducted in
Washington, DC, Baltimore, MD, Chicago, IL,
Miami, FL, and Cleveland, OH. In 1997,
thousands each of the book and video, both titled
<I>Your Genes, Your Choices</I>, have been sent to
literacy educators, community colleges, church
groups, libraries, and other organizations around
the country. In each workshop, a genetic counselor
or other genetic professional was present to answer
questions and provide insight into  genetic research
and issues. The entire book is also available on the
Web at <i><a
href="http://ehr.aaas.org/ehr/books/index.html">http://ehr.aaas.org/ehr/books/index.html</a></i>.  Our model for helping scientists communicate in
simple language will has impact beyond
classrooms and learning centers. Since not every
low-literate adult is enrolled in a literacy class, we
developed a model that reaches out to community
groups providing  health services. These groups
have indicated that easy-to-read materials on
genetics are not only desirable but necessary;
indeed, the groups we worked with often received
requests for information on heredity and genetics.
<I>Your Genes, Your Choices</I> enables medical and
scientific organizations to communicate more
effectively with economically disadvantaged
populations, which often include a large number of
low-literate individuals.

<p>New genetic findings from the Human Genome
Project (HGP) pose unique ethical questions and
legal/social concerns to those with disabilities and
their family members. Many disorders associated
with the disability of mental retardation have
genetic causes, with Down syndrome and fragile X
syndrome being the most common.

<p>In an effort to begin addressing these complex
issues, The Arc of the U.S. (the largest voluntary
organization on mental retardation in the country
with 140,000 members) developed a series of
reports, fact sheets and a training package for use
by the organization's leadership to educate
members about these important and timely issues.
The materials were distributed to all 1,100
chapters of The Arc and made available through
the internet. Some topics covered include:

<ul>
  <li>An Introduction to Genetics and Mental
Retardation</li>
  <li>Genetic Discrimination: Why Should We
Care?</li>
  <li>Genetic Testing, Screening and Counseling
- An Overview</li>
  <li>Protecting Genetic Privacy </li>

</ul>

<p>The aim of this educational effort is, first, to
provide a basic understanding of genetic
inheritance and mental retardation. Next, unique
concerns people with mental retardation and their
families may face in light of new genetic research
are addressed. Finally, inherited syndromes
associated with mental retardation are highlighted
to provide a practical example of how someone
with this disability is affected by the HGP and to
report on the latest research in genetic therapy. 

<p>The Arc's Human Genome Education Project:
Examining Genetic Ethical, Legal and Social
Issues is an interactive and comprehensive training
package which includes a detailed script for the
workshop leader, a pre and post-questionnaire to
measure change in opinion and understanding of
the issues, background information for the
presenter, print copies of overheads, a project
description to use in promoting the workshop, a 15
minute video and other handouts. The most
important objective of the training (discussing
highly complicated and sometimes controversial
issues) is achieved through the use of case
scenarios. Through this challenging exercise,
members actively learn how difficult it can be
making decisions regarding genetic testing, therapy
and discrimination on behalf of themselves or their
children who have disorders either caused by or
associated with mental retardation. By simplifying
medical terminology and concepts, identifying core
issues most threatening to those with disabilities
and utilizing practical case scenarios, members of
The Arc are better equipped to make informed
decisions and educated opinions on ethical, legal
and social issues impacting the lives of people with
mental retardation resulting from the HGP.

Unique Law
Limiting Employee Medical Records to
Job-Related Matters</B></a>

<p>Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, after a
conditional offer of employment an employer is
permitted to conduct medical examinations of
unlimited scope and may require the release of all
medical records in the possession of the
individual's health care providers. Allowing
unlimited access to personal medical records not
only facilitates surreptitious discrimination, but it
invades the privacy of individuals and discourages
at-risk individuals from undergoing genetic testing
in the clinical setting. 


<p>Pursuant to a law enacted in 1983, Minnesota is
the only state to restrict the scope of all medical
inquiries by employers to matters that are strictly
job-related and consistent with business necessity.
If this law has had no adverse effects on employers
or other parties, then it may serve as a model for
protecting genetic privacy in the workplace.


<p>We are using the following three main methods to
measure the effects of the law: (1) reviewing and
analyzing all of the cases filed under this law in the
last five years; (2) surveying human resource
managers in Minnesota (using Ohio as a control
state) to learn their opinions about limitations on
the scope of preplacement medical examinations;
and (3) doing an economic analysis in Minnesota
(with Ohio as the control state) of workers'
compensation claims rates, employee turnover
rates, productivity rates, health insurance claims
rates, and other data.


<p>The data collection phase is well underway and
should be completed by the end of 1997. Analysis
of the data will help determine whether this
legislative approach is a viable alternative to
current proposals for prohibiting genetic
discrimination in employment.

Resource
Project</B></a>
<p><B>Franklin M. Zweig</B>,  Ph.D., J.D.

<p>The Genetics Adjudication Resource Project
(GARP) has been  funded by the Ethical, Social
and Legal Issues (ELSI) Program of the DOE 
Human Genome Project to provide foundation
education for 1,000 judges of  federal and state
courts in genetics, molecular biology and biotechn- 
ology.  The Project's over-arching objective is to
familiarize judges,  who have little scientific
background, with the concepts, research  findings,
and vocabularly they are likely to encounter in civil
lawsuits  and criminal prosecutions.  Expected
evidence flows from parties'  pleadings and from
expert witness testimony.  ELSI matters flow from
the  conferences' active, case-based,
problem-solving curriculum. 


<p>The project's operational objective is to provide
judges with  tools by means of which to exercise
their gatekeeping duties for  scientific evidence. 
Those duties include, but are not limited to, 
determination of the fitness of the evidence for
presentation to juries.   


<p>The Conference series was preceded by four
preparatory "working  conversations" ("WC's")
intended to perfect a durable, effective, and 
adaptable educational technology template.  One of
the "WC's" was hosted  by the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in November,
1996.  The  first large scale conference of 106
judges and 40 faculty was held in  May, 1997 at
Airlie House, Airlie, Virginia for judges of courts
located  in the Greater Washington, D. C. region.


<p>The Project has been approved for conduct of six
conferences in  1997 and 1998.  Included are the
National Capital Area, New England,  Chicago,
and Mountain West regions, and two conferences
scheduled for  June 27-July 3 and August 1-6 at
Orleans, Cape Cod.  Three additional  conference
are on the drawing boards for the Mid-Atlantic
region in 1998  and in 1999 for the Southeast
regions, and for the California State  Courts.


<p>The GARP has also produced a Handbook for
Judges for Cases  Involving Genetics, Molecular
Biology and Biotechnology Evidence. Under 
production is a nine cassette videofilm primer. 
Another primer has been  produced by EINSHAC
within the courts' own publication system.  The 
Judges' Journal, a quarterly published by the
American Bar Association,  produced a dedicated
theme issue late Summer, 1997 entitled "Genetics
in  the Courtroom."  This primer is divided into
scientific and adjudication  perspectives. 


<p>Key to the GARP's conferencing success is the
recruitment,  training and deployment of science
advisors. Scientists reside with the  judges and the
informal interaction is a key supportive device in
making  this unfamiliar subject material patent to
lay judges. DOE scientists  and ELSI personnel
have been instrumental in this effort.  GARP
deploys  one scientist for every four judicial
participants.  GARP has developed  a training
program for scientific faculty so that differences in 
communication content and style rooted in the
judicial culture can be  anticipated and managed.
The training strategy is based upon the  different
professional paradigms (mental worlds unique to
adjudication  and to science) highlighted by the
literature and experienced in the  1995 and 1996
WC's.


<p>Science advisors are now being sought for the
1998 and 1999  judicial conferences. Six hour
training seminars will be scheduled  conveniently.
GARP promises an interesting experience with an
avid group  of learners whose day-to-day
responsibilities can make important  contributions
to our society's adaptation to advances in human
genetics.

Downstream
Products: A Tragedy of the
Anticommons?</B></a>


<p><B>Michael A. Heller</B> &amp; <B>Rebecca S. Eisenberg</B><sup>1</sup>

<br>University of Michigan Law School

The past twenty years have witnessed significant privatization of pre-market or "upstream" stages
of biomedical research.  In an earlier era, such research was typically performed in the public
sector and made freely available in the public domain to "downstream" users.  Today, public and
private institutions are increasingly likely to patent biomedical research discoveries that are several
steps removed from end product development. Patent rights have been credited with a
conspicuous increase in private funding for biotechnology research.  Yet paradoxically, a
proliferation of patent rights in upstream discoveries could create barriers to the development of
new pharmaceutical products further downstream in the R&D process.  
<P>
In this article we propose a theory of anticommons property to explain how too many upstream
intellectual property rights may lead to too few downstream products.  Anticommons property
may be understood as the mirror image of commons property.  In the familiar tragedy of the
commons, too many owners have the privilege to use scarce resources, and the property is prone
to overuse.  By contrast, in a tragedy of the anticommons, too many owners have the right to
exclude others from using a scarce resource, and the resource is prone to underuse. 
Anticommons property may arise whenever governments define new property rights that are too
fragmented.  Empty storefronts  in Moscow provide one stark example of this phenomenon.
Transition regimes charged with privatization have endowed multiple owners with overlapping
rights in each storefront, so no owner holds a useable bundle of rights to convey to an
entrepreneur who wishes to set up shop. As a result, scarce property is wasted.  Once an
anticommons emerges, collecting rights into useable bundles can be brutal and slow.  
<P>
Like post-socialist transition regimes, intellectual property systems are constantly creating new
property rights.  An anticommons could arise if multiple owners obtain fragmented patent rights
that are difficult to assemble into usable bundles.  The anticommons model provides one way of
understanding a widespread intuition that issuing patents on gene fragments makes little sense. 
Depending on their scope, patent rights in gene fragments could lead to the emergence of a
genomic anticommons in which a product developer requiring use of a full-length gene or a set of
polymorphic markers useful in diagnosing disease might be stymied by the costs of bundling
licenses from many patent owners.  Up to a point, privatization may enhance efficiency by
spurring investment in upstream research.  But privatization can go astray.  When the legal system
creates too many fragmented intellectual property rights, a tragedy of the anticommons could
block the development of new pharmaceutical products.

<p>This ELSI training program introduces high school
biology faculty to a laboratory-based unit on
human DNA polymorphisms - which provides a
uniquely personal perspective on the science and
ELSI aspects of the Human Genome Project.  By
targeting motivated biology faculty who currently
perform student laboratories with viral and
bacterial DNA, this program offers a cost-effective
means to bring high school biology education
up-to-the-minute with genomic biology.  In
October-November 1997, we are instructing the
first of 12 workshops nationwide at Mt. Sinai
School of Medicine (New York), Boston
University School of Medicine (Massachusetts),
and Canada College (California).


<p>The program is based on lab and computer
technology, developed at the DNA Learning Center
and the University of Chicago, that makes human
DNA "fingerprinting" by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) accessible and affordable for high
school use.  Program participants learn simplified
lab techniques for amplifying two types of
chromosomal polymorphisms - an Alu insertion
(TPA-25) and a VNTR (D1S80).  These
polymorphisms illustrate the use of DNA
variations in disease diagnosis, forensic biology,
and identity testing - and provide a starting point
for discussion of the uses and potential abuses of
genetic technology.  


<p>Workshop participants amplify their own
polymorphisms from DNA obtained from rapid
preparations of buccal cells and hair sheaths.  The
loci are amplified using rapid cycling profiles and
analyzed on agarose gels.  To further reduce the
cost of experiments, we have developed the
Biogenerator, the first inexpensive ($900) thermal
cycler licensed for precollege use.  This "Rube
Goldberg" thermal cycler articulates with a
Macintosh computer and gives results comparable
to commercial machines.

<p>Using a facility at our WWW site
(<I>http://darwin.cshl.org</i>), the Alu insertion data are
further
used as an entree into human population genetics
and genome diversity.  The "Student Allele
Database" has forms for entering
student-generated data, as well as archival data
from populations around the world.  Several
statistical functions are available: testing
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within a single
population, measuring genetic distance between
two populations, and comparing two populations
using contingency chi-square. A "Monte Carlo"
generator shows the effect of genetic drift in small
populations.


<p>During the summer, we developed reliable methods
for generating mitochondrial DNA sequence from
buccal and hair samples.  We hope to introduce
this technology at as many DOE workshop sites as
possible.  Workshop participants can then use their
own mitochondrial DNA sequence as an entree to
modern bioinformatics.  Our WWW site has a
step-by-step template for analyzing mitochndrial
DNA sequence - including similarity searches,
multiple sequence alignments, a recreation of the
Neandertal DNA analysis, and the identification of
the Romanov family remains.  Ultimately, we
envision students preamplifying their mitochondrial
DNAs and performing dye terminator reactions at
their own schools. The ready-to-sequence DNAs
would then be sent to regional centers for
sequencing and the results would be posted by
Internet. 


<p>Thus, we are striving to develop a robust and
accurate analog of human genome research that
allows students to use their own chromosomal and
mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms as the basis of
explorations into contemporary genomic biology.

<p>Previous policies to protect the confidentiality of
DNA-based tests have centered on protecting the
dispersion of genetic information.  In general, the
goal has been to keep information from passing
outside a health care institution to third parties that
might discriminate against patients in employment,
access to health care and other areas of civic life. 
We are focusing our attention on the threats to
patient welfare created within the setting of the
market-driven managed care organization (MCO). 
This setting presents unique ethical dilemmas,
since physicians (and, often, personnel at testing
laboratories) are employees of the MCO, and since
the payor and provider functions are contained
within the same entity.  In this context, the
institutional imperative of cost savings in order to
capture market share could lead to discrimination
in health care access (either through outright denial
of enrollment or prohibitive premiums) if
DNA-based tests reveal the likelihood of future
high-cost illnesses.  Our group -- which spans the
disciplines of genetics, medical ethics, health
economics and the law -- seeks to (i) formulate an
ethical construct for medical confidentiality with a
view to defining its core ethical functions and its
limitations in the changing health care system; (ii)
examine the practices and institutional imperatives
of market-driven MCOs to understand the context
in which the DNA-based tests would be used and
to assess the cost of confidentiality measures; (iii)
identify gaps in the policy framework that could
allow misuse of confidential medical information
within the MCO; and (iv) make recommendations
to remediate these gaps in policy in a manner that
is applicable and practical to MCOs. Progress to
date includes a preliminary formulation of
confidentiality concerns raised in the market-driven
managed care setting and the design of a survey
instrument to assess the institutional and marketing
practices of MCOs. We are paying specific
attention to the current practices of MCOs that
encroach on the core ethical concerns of  medical
confidentiality.

<p>The knowledge gained from the Human Genome
Project has the potential to correlate molecular
diagnosis with effective treatments and to lead the
way to novel medical interventions. The molecular
tools that have emerged from genetic studies are
changing the face of medical practice and
inaugurating a transitional period that will be
uncomfortable for both physicians and the public.
There will be marketing pressures, health care
industry changes, uneven supporting resources,
variable training of physicians, and limited public
understanding. We have designed an interactive,
multimedia CD-ROM course to ease this transition
for the majority of physicians, who have received
little or no training in clinical applications of
molecular genetics because the field has developed
so recently. The courseware, entitled "The New
Genetics: Courseware for Physicians. Molecular
Concepts, Applications, and Implications," will
provide accredited continuing education for
practicing physicians through the Stanford
University Office of Postgraduate Medical
Education.


<p>It is important for physicians to understand the
modern clinical applications of molecular genetics
for several reasons. First, physicians will be
explaining genetic tests and their implications to
their patients, selecting specific tests, and
interpreting the results. Second, physicians must be
able to work productively with other health
professionals, including genetic counselors and
psychologists. Third, standards of practice that
will govern the application of molecular genetic
diagnosis to patient care are currently under
development, and physicians need to contribute to
this evolution. Fourth, a lack of training in modern
genetics prevents many physicians from
understanding much current medical research.
Finally, physicians with training in molecular
medical genetics can serve as informed resource
persons and enhance the level of public
understanding of and appreciation for the Human
Genome Project in their communities. 


<p>The CD format confers multiple advantages for
continuing medical education. The delivery of
course materials via CD-ROM frees the physician
from a presentation schedule and does not require
travel and time away from a busy practice. CD's
function as an improved teaching resource because
of their interactivity and multimedia capability. We
have designed a streamlined, accessible
navigational system tailored to the needs of the
busy (and possibly computer-naive) physician.
Engaging interactive features and animations have
been created to convey complex concepts. The
course content is supervised by a Board of
Advisors. While the Internet is currently too slow
to serve as the primary delivery system, we are
programming the CD to accept updates and
supplements from the Internet or from a
subscription floppy.


<p>The development of a prototype version of the
courseware is funded by the Department of
Energy, and our current draft version of the
courseware will be demonstrated at the Workshop.

<p>With the continuing success of the Human Genome
Project (HGP),  more and more people are
interested in the project and wish to  understand its
results. Since the HGP has significant ethical, 
legal, and social implications for all citizens, the
number of  individuals who do, or should wish to
become familiar with the  project is high. In
addition to its importance in the training of 
professional geneticists, the HGP is of special
relevance for  undergraduate training in basic
biology, and even for high-school  and other K-12
education.


<p>Interest, however, is not enough. Real
understanding of the  results of HGP research
requires some familiarity with basic  genetics
notions. In particular, most of the methods and
findings  of molecular genetics are essentially
inaccessible to those  without appropriate training.
On the other hand, both the methods  and results of
early work in classical genetics can be appreciated
by virtually anyone: cross a black mouse with a
white  mouse, count the progeny of different
colors, then try to figure  out what might be going
on.


<p>A familiarity with the basic notions of classical
genetics is  essential for a simple appreciation of
the significance of the  HGP, and a more detailed
knowledge of classical genetics (including an
appreciation of the question, What is the chemical 
nature of the gene?), can provide a basis for the
genuine  understanding of HGP findings. Gaining
this basic understanding  of classical genetics is
becoming more difficult, even for  science majors.
The runaway success of modern molecular
genetics  is driving the detailed presentation of
classical genetics out of  most text books, and the
original literature is increasingly  difficult to
obtain.


<p>To address these problems, we have established an
electronic  educational resource at which classic
literature (both papers and  monographs), that
established the foundations of modern genetics,  is
being republished on-line, freely accessible to all.
Works are  being made available in a variety of
formats including simple  HTML, Adobe PDF files
containing high-quality typeset republications, and
Adobe PDF files containing image facsimiles  of
the original publication. The fundamental work of
Gregor  Mendel, for example, is available as both
a typeset republication  and as an image facsimile
of the original 1865 publication. 


<p>Funding for the project was received earlier this
year, and work  thus far has involved (1) moving
the original prototype site from  Johns Hopkins to
Seattle, (2) redesigning the site to make it  easier to
understand and use, and especially to prepare it to 
handle more data and more traffic, (3) establishing
high-efficiency systems for converting paper
publications into  electronic form, and (4)
acquiring material for republication.  When
full-scale publication begins in January, we
anticipate  publishing the equivalent of a 25-page
paper every day.

<p>The Community College Initiative  prepares
community college students for work in
biotechnology.  A combined effort of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory  (LBNL) and the
California Community Colleges, we aim to develop
mechanisms to encourage students to pursue
science studies, to participate in forefront
laboratory research, and to gain work experience. 
The initiative is structured to upgrade the skills of
students and their instructors through four
components.


<p>Summer Student Workshops:  Four weeks summer
residential programs for students who have
completed the first year of the biotechnology
academic program.  Ethical, legal and social
concerns are integrated into the laboratory
exercises and students learn to identify commonly
shared values of the scientific community as well
as increase their understanding of issues of
personal and public concern.  In the two year
period of the grant, we have involved over twenty
students.  Students in the second summer have had
laboratory interships.  


<p>Teacher Workshop Training:  Seminars for
biotechnology instructors to improve, upgrade, and
update their understanding of current technology
and laboratory practices, with emphasis on
curriculum development in current topics in
ethical, legal, and social issues in science.  These
workshops have involved the students as well.


<p>Sabbatical Fellowships:  For community college
instructors to provide investigative and field
experience in research laboratories.  During the
fellowship, teachers also assist in development of
student summer research activities.  


<p>This work was supported by the Director, Office

<p>The primary objectives of this grant are to develop,
implement, and distribute culturally competent,
linguistically appropriate, and relevant curricula
that leads to Hispanic student and family
interactions regarding the science, ethical, legal,
and social issues of the Human Genome Project.
By opening up channels of familial dialogue
between parents and their high school students,
entire families can be exposed to genetic health and
educational  information and opportunities. In
addition, greater interaction is anticipated between
students and teachers, and parents and teachers. 


<p>Each participating high school has taken different
approaches to exposing students and parents to the
science and ELSI of HGP. Some schools have
divided students into research teams from various
levels of biology curricula with each team
analyzing small segments of their own DNA. Other
schools have science classes following the BSCS
HGP-ELSI curricula or components of the
University of Washington High School Human
Genome Program. Still other schools have utilized
the materials that were developed by various Los
Angeles Unified School District science teachers.
Several other classes (e.g., Spanish classes,
English classes, Journalism classes, and Social
Science classes) at each participating school have
developed ELSI newsletters for distribution to the
parents. In addition, we have math and computer
science classes from one of the schools helping in
the construction of our web page. Each
participating school is also expected to have parent
focus groups which usually meet once per month in
the evening to discuss various genetic health issues
and implications of HGP.

<p>The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS)
has begun the development of an instructional
module on genetics and human behavior for use in
introductory high school biology. The module will
rectify the deficient treatment of the biology of
behavior in the current curriculum and will help to
dispel misconceptions about genes and human
behavior that often pervade media reports of
research in this area. The materials also will
address some of the ethical, legal, and social issues
generated by research into the biological basis of
behavior and will help to change traditional
assumptions about the teaching of genetics at the
high school level.


<p>The project employs the process of curriculum
development that BSCS has refined continually
since the inception of the organization in 1958. In
addition, development of the module is drawing
upon the experience BSCS acquired during the
development, distribution, and implementation of
three genome-related instructional modules
between 1991 and 1996. This experience includes
writing conferences, pilot and field testing of draft
materials, and periodic reviews of progress by
members of the education committees of the
National Society of Genetic Counselors, the
American Society of Human Genetics, the Council
of Regional Networks for Genetic Services, and
other independent experts in genetics.


<p>In late July 1997, BSCS completed the first of two
writing conferences during which experts in
behavioral and medical genetics, ethics, and high
school biology teaching produced a draft module
containing instructional activities for students and
extensive background materials for teachers. The
draft instructional activities are designed to help
students move through the following ideas:


<p>1. variation in behavior exists in populations;

<br>2. there are genetic and environmental components
to this behavioral variation;

<br>3. scientists have methods for investigating the
source of differences in human behavior;

<br>4. these methods have strengths and limitations;
and

<br>5. there are ethical, social, and legal implications
to understanding that genes influence behavior. 


<p>To test the effectiveness of the draft module in
helping students understand how genes and
environment influence human behavior, BSCS
pilot tested several activities in October. Following
analysis of these data, BSCS will refine the
materials, conduct a complete field test, convene a
second writing conference, produce the final
module, and distribute the module free of charge to
all interested high school biology teachers.

enhancing public understanding of microorganisms
and the roles they play in sustaining the planet. 
Partners include the American Society for
Microbiology, Baker &amp; Simon, Oregon Public
Broadcasting, the Association of Science and
Technology Centers, and the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.  The MLC's
initiatives include

<ul>
  <li><I>Intimate Strangers: Unseen Life on Earth</I>,
a television series airing in 1999</li>
  <li>Formal college and precollege educational
programs, designed specifically to support
and enhance teaching in settings where

</ul>

<p>The scientific messages delivered through these
projects will promote a balanced view of our
interactions with our microbial partners on the
planet.  One of the MLC's primary goals is to
dispel public anxiety about microorganisms which
has been created through intensive media focus on
microbes as disease agents.  Viewers and
participants will be introduced to broad concepts
such as 

<ul>
  <li>The important microbial role as
bioremediators and how we can use their
natural processes to help clean up our
environment,</li>
  <li>The biotechnological potential for
microbial products and processes and how
they can better our daily lives</li>
  <li>The microbial basis of all ecosystems and
how we can sustain our environment while
still developing the economic potential of
our natural resources</li>
  <li>The linkages between global climate
changes and microbial processes and how
increasing our understanding of these
linkages can influence public policy</li>
  <li>New strategies for understanding and

<br>The three initiatives of the MLC received a
guarantee for complete funding in May, 1997.  The
intellectual framework for the science documentary
was established at a seminal meeting of the Science
Advisory Group held in Woods Hole, MA, three
years prior to funding.  The production staff
officially began work Oct. 6 and are presently
participating in "Microbiology school" and
beginning to formulate story lines for the four part
series to reflect the scientific content.


<p>Planning for the Annenberg sponsored telecourse
began mid-summer, with a meeting of the Science
Education Advisory group at OPB.  The group is
nearing completion of curricular content and
learning objectives for an accredited college level
telecourse, both of which will be finalized at an
upcoming meeting in October.


<p>The Advisory Group to the informal set of
initiatives met in September for a 3 day planning
meeting to discuss the hands on activities that will
be developed to accompany each of their
dissemination plans.


<p>The official kickoff meeting for the MLC will take
place at the end of the month at Mt. Hood, Oregon,
where all parties will come together to validate
timelines and recognize who the responsible parties
are for various aspects of each of the three
initiatives.

<p>The High School Human Genome Program
(HSHGP) encourages high school students to think
constructively about the scientific and ethical
issues of genomic research by enabling them to
participate in both. This program supports many of
the teaching objectives presented in the National
Science Education Standards (1996), including
meeting the content standards for genetics
education, teaching science through inquiry and
developing a learning community of teachers and
scientists to promote better science education.
Participating students learn about many career
options in science through discussions with
scientist mentors who assist during classroom
experiments, and the lab experiences help to
prepare them for future employment. 


<p>A. Program modules. The DNA Synthesis
experiment is an introductory experiment that
helps students learn about DNA structure and
replication and develop their laboratory skills.
During the DNA Sequencing experiment, students
sequence a region of chromosome 5 that is
involved in a hereditary form of deafness. This
project is made possible through a collaboration
with Eric Lynch and Mary-Claire King from the
Departments of Genetics and Medicine at the
University of Washington. The Ethics unit, which
focuses on presymptomatic testing for
Huntington's disease, helps students develop the
skills to define ethical issues, ask and research
relevant questions about a particular topic and
make justifiable ethical decisions. The module was
developed by Sharon Durfy and Robert Hansen
from the UW Department of Medical History and
Ethics. 


<p>B. Teacher Preparation and Classroom
Implementation. Local, regional and national
teachers attend a week-long summer workshop,
which provides training in program modules,
informal seminars and discussions of relevant
topics. 


<p>C. Equipment Kit Loans. During the academic
year, local teachers are provided with the
necessary equipment, supplies and technical
assistance to carry out the classroom experiments.
Teachers from distant sites receive DNA templates
and primers and ongoing technical advice. This
program is currently serving 32 high school
teachers at fifteen schools in Washington state and
13 other teachers nationally.


<p>D. The HSHGP web-site (<I><a
href="http://hshgp.genome.washington.edu">http://hshgp.genome.washington.edu</a></i>). This
site is intended as a resource
for teachers and students everywhere and contains
the following:


<p>Program modules. These are available on-line or in
a downloadable version. On-line DNA assembly
and data analysis. This tutorial enables students to
carry out the assembly of the sequencing data from
the web-site, using the demonstration version of the
DNA assembly program, <I>Sequencher</I> and a folder
of student data files.


<p><I>Virtual DNA sequencing</I>. This tutorial enables
classrooms that are unable to do the sequencing
experiment to do many aspects of the sequencing
process by providing scans of student sequencing
ladders and highlighting the portions of our
teaching modules that can be used to simulate
DNA sequencing. 


<p>Future tutorials on the Web-site:

<br>On-line research projects. In the future, we will
develop tutorials that help students access DNA
and protein databases and related analysis software
and understand what the analysis software is
doing. Once students understand these tools, they
will be able to design and explore their own plan
research problems.

<p>Exploring ethical issues related to genomic
research. We plan to develop additional modules
that emphasize how the decision making process
can be used to examine any ethical issue.

<p>Communication among program participants.
Discussion boards will be set up so that
participants can discuss technical problems and
solutions, ask research questions and exchange
classroom tips.


<p>E. Program Evaluation: Preliminary results of
program evaluation will be discussed.

<p>The Pennsylvania Biotechnology Association
(PBA) in cooperation with the Alliance for Science
Education (ASE) publishes the biotechnology
science magazine <I>YOUR WORLD/OUR WORLD</I>
to introduce middle and high school studentsto the
underlying science and the social issues raised by
modern biological research and technology.  In the
Spring of 1996, with partial DOE funding, a
special enlarged issue of <I>YOUR WORLD/OUR
WORLD</I> dealing with the underlying science of
genomics, and the ethical, legal, and social issues
raised by the Human Genome Project (HGP) was
published. 


<p>PBA and ASE are now creating additional
instructional materials for use by middle and high
school students to facilitate a more extensive
presentation of the subjects covered in the special
issue. These materials are being built in two
phases. First, by assembling and reviewing for
usefulness materials from other publishers and by
continuing the development of new materials by
PBA to create a comprehensive supplemental
materials package that provides resources in
several different media.  Second, by running
national contest for science teachers and students
to encourage classroom development of new and
original approaches to teaching the material.
Materials from both phases will each in turn be
packaged and made available to the 45,000 middle
school and high school biology teachers in the
United States over the next 24 months.


<p>This project is targeted at middle and high school
teachers and students for several reasons - most of
the biological information studied and learned in
the United States occurs at this level, students are
generally very interested in biology and science at
these levels, and teachers can greatly assist
students in considering this material, but need more
support in teaching about the HGP and ELSI.


<p>Phase I Materials are expected to include:


<ul>
  <li>A Further Exploration of the Science and
Ethics, Legal and Societal Issues of
Genomics</li>
  <li>Reference Materials for Genomics</li>
  <li>Teaching Plans, Colorful Overheads &amp;

<p>Families, health care providers, and the general
public are all increasingly aware of the human
genome project discoveries. However, many do not
have a background on basic genetic information,
and therefore are not aware of, or prepared for, the
ethical, legal, and social implications of this new
technology and the applications. Our program
helps prepare high school students for their future
through updated information and resources from
their biology teachers. Each teacher in this project
spent time in educational activities over a two-year
period, learning about updated information through
two one-week workshops, preparing updated
lesson plans, presenting peer teacher programs,
and networking with other teachers, genetic
professionals, and ELSI experts.


<p>During 1993-1997, 177 teachers attended a series
of Human Genome Teacher Networking education
workshops which addressed the applications of
Human Genome Project technology, with a focus
on ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI).
After the teachers attended summer workshops,
they used new materials with students, then
conducted peer and community education
programs, and contacted genetic and ELSI experts
to enhance their classroom teaching. The networks
which developed between teachers, liaisons with
genetic professionals, peer teacher programs, and
on-line computer communications helped educators
and their students obtain current human genetics
information.


<p>We analyzed the improvement in teacher
confidence and preparedness and measured student
achievement as a result of the summer workshops.
Following the workshops, teachers were prepared
and confident teaching complex genome technology
and applications (p&lt; .05). They acquired new
information to expand their knowledge of human
genetics and integrate the complex information into
existing science curricula. Some teachers
developed new school courses. Student
achievement was significantly increased (p&lt;.05)
due to teacher attendance at the workshops. The
teachers gained a new awareness of the scientific
as well as the personal aspects of the genome
information. 


<p>Participants were prepared to help students
understand the ramifications of HGP discoveries
and readily access information on many aspects of
the Human Genome Project, including decisions
regarding genetic testing. Their students scored
significantly higher (p &lt; .05) on a survey of
knowledge than of comparable students whose
teachers did not attend the workshop. 


<p>Teachers, as part of their biology curricula, can
integrate genome project concepts, and help
students understand the ELSI issues which will be
important in their future. Teachers are enthusiastic
about education workshops, they increase the
amount of curricula time devoted to genome/ ELSI
projects, and can present information at an
appropriate pace for students. The studentis
science literacy is increased on timely topics, and
they have knowledge of internet and other
resources to answer new questions, not available in
current published textbooks. 


<p>Workshop resource materials, lesson plans, the
mentor network, and teachers who agreed to have
their names listed on the internet are available
though the web site for this project:
<I><A href="http://www.kumc.edu/gec">http://www.kumc.edu/gec</a></i> (Genetics

<p>A two-hour national PBS special (aired September
16, 1997), <I>A Question of Genes</I>  looks for the first
time at the ethical, social and legal implications of
genetic testing.  <I>A Question of Genes</I> enters the
lives of a few individuals and families as they
confront genetic risks for conditions like heart
disease, Alzheimer's, breast cancer and genetic
birth defects. <I>A Question of Genes</I> explores the
profound challenges genetic information makes to
a person's sense of self, family and future.  Closely
observing regular people over several years, <I>A
Question of Genes</I> takes us inside the decisions
and dilemmas of a range of personalities and
perspectives:  a woman who had a preventive
mastectomy after losing three sisters to breast
cancer tries to make sense of her just-discovered
results;  a poor African-American mother struggles
to know more about the genetic legacy to her
daughter;  a physician who administers genetic
tests wrestles with ethical dilemmas about his
patients' privacy and rights;  a pregnant woman
makes startling decisions about the fate of her
unborn children. 


<p>In seven stories told by the participants themselves,
<I>A Question of Genes</I> captures both the profound
emotional drama as well as the enormous social,
legal and ethical implications of the powerful new
technology of genetic testing.   <I>A Question of
Genes</I> was produced and directed by Noel
Schwerin for the Chedd/Angier Production

<p><I>The DNA Files</I> is a series of nationally distributed
public radio programs furthering public education
on developments in genetic science.  Program
content is guided by a distinguished body of
advisors and will include the voices of prominent
genetic researchers, people affected by advances in
the clinical application of genetic medicine,
members of the biotech industry, and others from
related fields.  They will provide real-life examples
of the complex social and ethical issues associated
with new discoveries in genetics.  In addition to the
general public radio audience, the series will target
educators, scientists, and involved professionals. 
Ancillary educational materials will be distributed
in paper and digital form through over
collaborative organizations and in fulfillment of
listener requests. 


<p>With information linking major diseases such as
breast cancer, colon cancer, and arteriosclerosis to
genetic factors, new dangers in public perception
emerge.  Many people who hear about them
mistakenly conclude that these diseases can now be
easily diagnosed and even cured.  On the other end
of the public perception spectrum, unfounded fears
of extreme, and highly unlikely, consequences also
appear.  Will society now genetically engineer
whole generations of people with "designer genes"
offering more "desirable physical qualities"?  <I>The
DNA Files</I> will ground public understanding of
these issues in reality.  A live, two-hour call-in
show will cover the broad scope of human genetic
research and its applications.  It will include a
discussion with experts, and a chance for listeners
at home to make comments and ask questions.  


<p>Nine one-hour documentaries will provide the
basic science of DNA, genes and heredity, while
illustrating the accompanying social and ethical
issues. "DNA and the Law," for example, reviews
the scientific basis for genetic fingerprinting and
looks at cases of alleged genetic discrimination by
insurance companies, employers and others. 
"Gene Therapy: Medicine for Our Genes" takes on
popular descriptions of genetic therapy, derived
from stories like Jurassic Park, and attempts to
help us realistically understand the science, as well
as its promise, limits, and social implications. 
Other shows include "The Commercialization of
Genetics," "Prenatal Genetic Testing: Better
Babies Through Science," and "Genetic Evolution,
Diversity and Kinship."

with Hispanic Radio Network (HRN) and the
National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR)
has developed Spanish radio programming and
outreach services which will help inform Hispanics
on the ethical, legal, and social issues related to the
Human Genome Project and motivate them to
access the resources available for further education
on these issues.  Funding by DOE-ELSI supports
the production of 50 new episodes of "Buscando la
Belleza" (BB) for broadcast over the period of two
years;  extensive, national outreach and referral
services and a linked Web site.
