<P><B>Herman I. Abromowitz, M.D.</B></P>
<P>We are a small but a mighty crew here this morning. In view of the magnitude 
of our topic and the expertise of our speakers, I would like to start the 
program now, and the fact that we really only have about an hour and a half, an 
hour and forty minutes.</P>
<P>With everybody’s attention I would like to welcome each and every one of you 
here. Two moderators for this morning will be myself — I am Herman Abromowitz, 
Member of the Board of Trustees — and Dr. Ron Davis, Member of the Board of 
Trustees. Ron is also the past chair of the Council on Scientific Affairs which 
put together a tremendous article on this which the House of Delegates received 
in December of 2000.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But anyway to go forward, food modification and biotechnology continues to 
garner greater attention today among the media and among our patients. I think 
Dave Hanna and I who are here as family physicians, there’s hardly a day that 
goes by that one of my patients does not ask me about food and modification of 
food technology and things of that sort.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So this is a problem the general public is also interested in. Its concern 
over the use of consumption of the modified food elements. As stated in the 
interim 2000 meeting the AMA’s Council on Scientific Affairs brought forth a 
major article on this. The bottom line on that article was that this subject 
needed essential ongoing research and study and development concerning food 
technology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This morning we have four distinguished experts. I am going to introduce them 
one by one. We will talk about biotechnology and its role in modifying plants 
for food production. Our panelists will discuss key human health and safety 
issues, benefits of the environment and public policy ramifications of food 
technology. At the end of this session we hope to have an interesting Q&amp;A 
that Dr. Davis will chair.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Before I begin this morning, I would like to say we need a couple of 
housekeeping items to inform you of the CME purposes for this and we have asked 
each panelist to make the following statement: “All speakers in this session 
have submitted disclosure forms. The AMA has reviewed these forms and there is 
no significant conflict of interest to discuss.”</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I might add in attendance today is Seemin Pasha. She is the Constituency 
Relations Director of Council for Biotechnology Information, the group that gave 
us the unrestricted educational grant. We would like to recognize you, Seemin, 
and thank you very much. [applause]</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>As I begin to introduce the first speaker, many of us do not need a formal 
introduction to </P>
<P>Dr. Daniel Stormy Johnson, who is past President of the AMA and past Speaker 
of the House of Delegates. Stormy has been involved with the International Food 
Information Council, and Stormy is a diagnostic radiologist from Louisiana and 
is a strong believer in using technology to improve health and well being.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I might add personally yesterday you heard the pride of the profession 
discuss — we had four outstanding winners. Well, Stormy Johnson to me emulates 
the pride of the profession. I am happy to be a colleague of Stormy Johnson’s. 
Stormy, thank you very much.</P><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P><B>Stormy Johnson, M.D.</B></P>
<P>Thank you very much, Herman, for those personal and certainly unnecessary but 
much appreciated sentiments. I can assure you the feeling is mutual. I have 
enjoyed my relationship with you over time and having the opportunity to serve 
with you on the Board of Trustees of the AMA was a great pleasure, and I applaud 
you for the work that you continue to do for the association, for physicians and 
for all our patients.</P>
<P>My role this morning is to kind of set the stage a little bit for three 
outstanding speakers that you are going to hear from, following me, who are 
going to, I believe, illuminate the various facets of this subject in an amazing 
way given the fact that we have such a limited time. They are very talented 
folks, and it’s a privilege for me to appear on the program with them.</P>
<P>I do need to emphasize one thing that was mentioned in my own introduction. I 
have a relationship with the International Food Information Council as a 
consultant and spokesperson and receive support from them. I don’t do that as a 
conflict of interest, but I disclose that to be certain that you are aware of 
that.</P>
<P>The thoughts that I want to offer to you over the next few minutes are built 
around four areas. First of all, why me? What is a diagnostic radiologist doing 
involved in this issue? Why is this issue being presented at all at this 
leadership conference? Why is the subject an issue in the eyes of the public? 
What is your role? Why you? Why are you here? What is your opportunity and 
responsibility with respect to that?</P>
<P>Now, as far as I am personally concerned as a diagnostic radiologist, that 
enters into my thinking. But so also does an assignment I had for the AMA. Early 
in my 11-year career as an AMA officer, I think probably when I was a Vice 
Speaker, I was given the topic to defend for two years the use of animals in 
biomedical research and I came to understand something about the folks in this 
country and around the world who take a posture of being anti-science without 
respect to the facts. It’s very easy to advocate something if you’re not 
encumbered with the facts, and so it was a learning experience for me.</P>
<P>Among many things that came my way when I finished my formal AMA career, I 
became aware of a couple of things about the folks who are trying to introduce 
the technology and help us take advantage of the technology that exists with 
respect to production of food, I felt like, and I am somewhat critical of them, 
that they didn’t understand (a) what a good message they had and (b) they 
weren’t doing a very good job of presenting that. I am going to comment on that 
a little later on.</P>
<P>I think (c), and more important than the first two, is they don’t understand 
how vulnerable they are to this mindset of people who are not interested in the 
facts, who are not interested in science but have some other agenda. And since I 
know a little bit about that, it piqued my interest.</P>
<P>The second thing is as a diagnostic radiologist, much like you do in your own 
specialties, but I know more about my specialty than about yours. I rely on the 
continuing development of fantastic technology to help sick and injured people 
get better. I see the benefit of using technology for the improvement of the 
public health and individual health every day in my practice. So the notion that 
someone would interfere with access of the people either in this country or 
elsewhere around the world to that technology, particularly interfere with it 
for reasons other than scientific reasons, I find offensive. So it wasn’t very 
hard to get my battery charged with respect to that.</P>
<P>And the third issue is not to be overlooked and that is something of a 
contrarian philosophy that I have. I think that derives from being a physician. 
If you think about it, the two major attributes of the medical education are to 
question what anybody else says or writes, not to take it simply for granted but 
to evaluate it yourself. And the other thing to derive from medical education is 
a lifelong thirst for knowledge. So I think both of those apply here.</P>
<P>But beyond that, those two things build in each one of us something that I 
would call a typical physician’s skepticism. We look at something. We question 
it. We make our own judgments. We’re rugged individualists with respect to that. 
It’s something that we’re sort of required to do as a part of our 
professionalism, and I believe that skepticism drives me, that sort of 
contrarian philosophy, to stand up to people who want to deny people in my 
country access to </P>
<P>that technology.</P>
<P>Now, let’s shift gears here a little bit, and I again want to set the stage 
because you’re going to hear some remarkable comments. But why is the use of 
biotechnology in food production important? In my view it’s important for 
several reasons. One of the most intriguing ones is that there has been for 
thousands of years a desire to improve the product of agricultural endeavor. 
Various kinds of breeding and cross-breeding techniques have been used, but they 
are very slow. Now, with the advent of technology those same kinds of things can 
be done in a much shorter period of time and one can figure out what works and 
what doesn’t work. One can also be much more specific reducing the unintended 
consequences and focusing in on the desired aspects of what is attempting to be 
done. So to me the technology simply facilitates fulfilling desires that those 
interested in producing food have had for thousands of years.</P>
<P>Now, among the things that can happen is to increase the particular crop 
yield by various technologies. There are areas in this country which produce an 
abundance of food. But if you look around the world, that’s not necessarily 
true. There are many, particularly underdeveloped countries, who can benefit 
from making their agricultural production more efficient or more cost effective 
to the enormous benefit of the citizens and frankly, reducing the drain on 
countries more successful like our own. The notion of decreasing the use of 
pesticides, and you are going to hear about all of this later on from the other 
speakers. The actual improvement in the quality of the product. Delayed ripening 
so that you have a longer shelf life so that you have the capacity to have a 
fresher product at the time of actual consumption, and improvement in the taste 
of the product making it a more desirable situation. So I think those simple 
things are reasonable objectives, and they are ones that if they can be pursued 
safely, deserve that pursuit.</P>
<P>Now, an interesting thing sort of comes to mind as an aside about the scope 
of the agricultural endeavor. Some data that I didn’t know and perhaps you don’t 
know as well, as I continue to dig into this and become more interested in it. 
There are approximately 80,000 known species of edible plants. Of those, about 
300 are in cultivation some place around the world. But of those 300, about 12 
have emerged as staples of either our diet or the diet of others around the 
world. So we are not talking about a huge target area here in terms of being 
able to be effective and to use the technology in a safe and effective way.</P>
<P>Now, you might say, well, moving on to the next sort of category to set this 
up, why is there any problem? Herman has referenced the Council on Scientific 
Affairs’ report to you. You have on the table there in front of you a summary of 
the recommendations. But I would commend to your attention the entire report, 
particularly if you have an interest in the particular science of any or all of 
the methods that are involved. The report is an extremely thorough report. It is 
accessible to you through the AMA Web site. You simply go to the Web site, go to 
the Council on Scientific Affairs, go to their reports, and it’s very easy to 
find. I am not a super navigator of anybody’s Web site, including the AMA’s, but 
this report is very easy to find and I suggest that you will find more 
information there than you are apt to want. But you can pick and choose from 
there. If you are particularly interested in other references, the bibliography 
contains 133 references as well as numerous tables that I think you will find 
interesting. So I urge you to look at Report 10 from Interim 2000, the Council 
on Scientific Affair’s Report 10 from the Interim 2000.</P>
<P>Now, the recommendations posed in that report which you have on the sheets in 
front of you were made to the House of Delegates and they were adopted by the 
House of Delegates, so we are talking about AMA policy here.</P>
<P>Now, some of the problems that were discussed in that report include I think 
a legitimate concern for the safety of humans. I mean, after all that’s what we 
are about as physicians. Among those safety concerns include the notion of the 
possibility of introducing toxic substances or toxic behavior for certain 
foodstuffs. The notion of allergenicity with respect to those foodstuffs and the 
question can some type of modification of the product actually increase the 
possibility of allergenicity to that. I would argue that there is also the 
countervening possibility that known allergens can be dealt with effectively and 
some way modified out of the product potentially by the use of the technology. 
So, just as that’s a potential hazard, it’s also a potential gain and something 
that the researchers can continue to deal with.</P>
<P>The potential for transfer of anti-microbial resistant genes from one product 
to another. With respect to the environment, the notion of developing pests that 
are resistant to modified plants. So instead of a plant that kills the typical 
pest that invades that plant, we have an end result where the plant is actually 
more resistant to those pests and perhaps even having that particular plant 
eliminated or compromised by the technology that was intended to help us.</P>
<P>The possibility for toxicity for non-target organisms, for other insects or 
vectors that derive harm from something which would interrupt the process in the 
food chain. The notion of creation of super viruses or the potential creation of 
super weeds that consume the resources and crowd out the desired plans. You’re 
going to see some beautiful examples of how we can get away from that, but there 
is the potential for unintended consequences. Those are issues.</P>
<P>There are consumer issues that I would suggest are worthy of consideration. I 
have spoken to one of those which is the attitude that consumers have, 
particularly to the notion that the proponents of the technology have done a 
less than adequate job. Now, you have on the panel following me some outstanding 
advocates, but they need help. They need to be able to have their efforts 
expanded and so we’re going to come back to that particular point and the role 
that physicians play.</P>
<P>The opponents, on the other hand as I suggested earlier, have not relied on 
science. They are not really interested in the science. They have other agendas. 
Now, that is not to say all of them are that way. There are clearly individuals 
who bring up important scientific considerations and those deserve careful 
attention. But the opponents who raise scientific issues in a scientific way 
deserve to have their concerns heard and I certainly would not argue otherwise. 
I am more disturbed by the people who make allegations without understanding or 
without even attempting to look at the issue from a scientific perspective.</P>
<P>The third leg of that stool is that the government has not done a 
particularly effective job in making it possible for the citizens of our country 
or elsewhere, and sometimes it’s a barrier for that, to fully discuss and 
understand what the issues are. I would suggest there’s an opportunity for 
improvement for government.</P>
<P>With respect to the consumer issues, one that’s very dear to my heart and 
health system reform, is the notion of consumer choice. What we have in effect 
because of the action of government, for example, in Europe rather than giving 
consumers choice, we have actually denied consumers choice by actions of 
government so that people don’t really have, in some venues, the opportunity to 
take advantage of the technology. And you’re going to hear some examples of that 
right here in our own country, some very disturbing examples of how the 
technology could benefit people in this country and they don’t have access to 
that. So the notion of attempting to give consumers choice has backfired in my 
judgment and some places denying people access to technology that they might 
otherwise be able to enjoy.</P>
<P>The issue of labeling. A very significant consumer issue and I think some 
people don’t realize in the controversy about labeling of products that foods 
that are developed through biotechnology intervention have the same rules for 
labeling as their counterparts that have not experienced the intervention. In 
other words, the Food and Drug Administration said we’re going to regulate all 
tomatoes the same way unless something is done to materially alter that tomato 
with respect to the use of the tomato or, for example, with respect to 
allergenicity. If something is done to that tomato that increases the potential 
for someone to be allergic to that tomato, then that change has to be labeled. 
The tomatoes that have been developed through biotechnology are treated the same 
way with respect to labeling as tomatoes that have not been.</P>
<P>So the labeling issue is a controversy that I believe is a smoke screen for 
other concerns and needs to be dealt with appropriately.&nbsp; Interestingly in 
that report in the recommendations of the Council on Scientific Affairs, they’ve 
said that at this time — and they use that caveat — at this time some special 
labeling is not necessary apart from whatever I described to you.</P>
<P>Now, that leads me finally to you as physicians and why you should be 
interested in this. And in the recommendations of the Council on Scientific 
Affairs is one that they propose, and as I said was adopted by the House of 
Delegates, that says basically that the medical community in concert with the 
public and other stakeholders has the responsibility to educate the public and 
approve the availability of unbiased information. I think that is a very 
important role, even responsibility, for us as physicians to see to it that 
people are able to make their own decisions based on good information and good 
science.</P>
<P>Now, you by definition attending a meeting such as this leadership 
conference, and by definition of the roles that you play in your own 
communities, are the leaders of medicine. I would observe that physicians 
arguably are the most important purveyors of science in the everyday life of the 
people in our country. If you view the interaction between physicians and 
patients every day, what you have is a translation of scientific method into 
understandable terms for people who are in need of that science. And so we as 
physicians are comfortable with using advanced technology, with learning it and 
distributing it on a regular basis. It’s what we do all day every day. So we are 
natural people to underscore to our patients what the significance of 
approaching controversial issues like this one in a scientific way mean.</P>
<P>I would argue that you should apply your own skepticism, your own 
professionalism and skepticism, as well as your own appreciation of what 
technology can do as you go through your daily lives as patient advocates. When 
you have a question such as Dr. Abromowitz referred to coming from a patient, it 
behooves you to be able to tell your patients how they can learn more and to 
give them some comfort and explain to them how you use technology every day 
yourself. Technology in itself is not bad. But something that denies people the 
opportunity to employ useful technology is something we all ought to be worried 
about.</P>
<P>I would summarize all of that in the following way. The challenge that we 
face with respect to the use of biotechnology and food production is education. 
The magic word is science.</P>
<P>Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to any questions. 
[applause]</P><B><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all></B>
<P><B>Dr. Abromowitz</B></P>
<P>Well, thank you, Stormy, for those superb remarks leading off the program and 
thank you for letting us all remember 9/11 as the six months is today.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Our next speaker, panelist this morning comes to us from the University of 
Illinois. </P>
<P>Dr. Bruce Chassy is the Assistant Dean for Biotechnology Outreach in the 
Office of Research, College of Agriculture, Consumer and Environmental Sciences. 
He also serves as Executive Associate Director at the University of Illinois 
Biotechnology Center. Dr. Chassy received his doctorate in biochemistry from 
Cornell University and [his] research interests have focused on the development 
of recombinant DNA techniques in the host vector systems to the genetic 
manipulation of food microorganisms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This morning Bruce will talk about food safety and health issues. In a side 
issue, I am proud to say that Bruce’s father has been a long-time member of the 
AMA, and so we are especially happy to recognize that and to recognize Dr. 
Chassy. Thank you.</P><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P><B>Bruce M. Chassy, Ph.D., University of Illinois</B></P>
<P>Thank you very much. It’s a pleasure to be here.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I grew up just down the road in San Diego, so I always like to come to L.A., 
and as you just heard, I have reasons for wanting to associate myself with this 
organization.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>You also just heard that I spent a good deal of time doing research in 
biotechnology. I was working with organisms that would be used in food or 
medicine. In fact, we tried to use microorganisms for some very novel, we 
thought, and inventive purposes. One of the things that came to mind almost 
immediately was, well, we’re going to ask people to eat these organisms. Are 
they safe? What are the issues?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So I migrated from the National Institutes of Health as a researcher into the 
area of food safety, and went in 1989 to the University of Illinois to head the 
Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition. I have served on the FDA Food 
Advisory Committee and I have been on the FAO WHO expert panel on foods derived 
from biotechnology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I did all of this as a scientist and, in the last couple of years, I decided 
it was time to stop being a research scientist and to — trying to provide just 
what you heard, which was outreach that would help the public be able to make 
informed decisions on the basis of a good understanding of </P>
<P>the science.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I want to say at the outset, I have never taken a grant or a contract from 
the biotech industry and I don’t have any financial interest in the biotech 
industry. My business is not trying to sell their products. But I will sometimes 
appear to be an advocate. I get all excited about this. I want you to know that 
that excitement is about what this technology can do, and it’s about how we can 
use science to inform policy. But be very clear about this. We are not talking 
purely about science. Science informs policy, and as I go through these slides 
very quickly, I’m going to point out some places where there is some legitimate 
difference of opinion, difference of values and areas that we need discussion as 
a society that have nothing to do with science, and there are good and 
sufficient reasons for having concerns about the technology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, we have all seen biotechnology in the news. You know the monarch 
butterfly at least was last year’s poster child for a movement that is very 
concerned about the effects of this technology on the environment. There are 
also a lot of people that are concerned about the effects of this technology in 
our food system. This cover of Greenpeace magazine says “It Came From the 
Grocery Store: The Horror of Genetic Engineering — Do You Know What’s in the 
Food You Eat?”</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>What I would have done today is taken a lot of time if we had about 6 or 8 or 
12 hours to tell you about the progression of use of genetic manipulation in the 
development of the foods we eat. None of the plants we grow look anything like 
they did in their wild state. We have extensively modified them through 
breeding. This happens to be the progenitor of corn, teosinte and, at the 
bottom, corn as we know it today. As you know, it was developed in Mesoamerica — 
some 6,000 to 8,000 years ago, this progression started.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am not here to make the argument that genetic manipulation as it’s done 
today is anything like it’s been done for the last few thousand years, but 
simply to point out why this technology has been adopted so quickly. In that 
kind of traditional breeding that I just showed you, you essentially as the 
schematic shows take two different varieties — the green DNA and the white DNA — 
and you mix them and you get some kind of hybrid between them. You may have a 
desired trait in that green DNA, and what you get is a mixture of white and 
green DNA, and now you have to breed that back to become a kind of plant that 
you want to grow that’s going to be ergonomically successful and have other 
properties that are desirable. That’s a long, arduous process, and you can’t 
always get where you want to get.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, along comes molecular biology or the new biology, and now you can 
isolate a single gene from anywhere that has a trait that you like, and you can 
put it into a plant. It’s not always easy. I wouldn’t want to say that this 
technology is like falling off a log for the companies that do it or the 
scientists and universities that do it. Maybe Alan McHughen can tell you more 
about that since he’s done it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But it does give you much more power, and it is that power itself that is the 
source of some of the controversy because to many people we should not be 
playing God with nature and playing around with genes, and they have a problem 
with taking genes from places that are organisms that never would have crossed 
with the organisms that we’re growing. The unity of life and how similar the 
pattern, the design of all nature, is. In fact, that’s why this works. The 
reason you can take a gene from distant places and put it into a crop is because 
all living things function very much the same way and use very much the same 
machinery. But there is a real discussion that has little to do with science and 
a lot to do with world view.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>What we decided early on was that we did need to see if this new technology 
presented any particular risks. With regard to the application of a new 
technology, you can either say it violates my values and I want no part of it or 
I am willing to take a look at it if it meets my conditions that will give me 
some benefits, that will possibly lower my costs and it doesn’t make the 
situation worse than it is. That it’s not dangerous. Physicians do risk benefit 
analyses all the time. We’ll touch on a medical one a little later.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So we’ve got a new technological tool. We know that technologies normally 
aren’t either good or bad. It’s what we do with them, how we apply them, that 
makes them good or bad. And so what we are going to do is going to look at each 
application of this technology and see if we approve. There will be applications 
of this technology, which I submit we will reject because we don’t like the 
formula. It doesn’t add up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The other attribute of the system besides case-by-case review, the system 
that is used the world over for looking at this technology, is the fact. I guess 
there are two attributes. One is that it’s a comparative assessment. You can 
never prove absolute safety. Nothing is absolutely safe. So when you do this 
case-by-case assessment, you compare the new technology or the application of 
the new technology to the current situation or other alternatives, and you only 
ask for it to be as safe as or safer than what you’re doing today. So in the 
abstract I am never going to prove absolute safety, but I can do a 
comparison.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Many of the arguments leveled against biotechnology are absolute statements 
about risk, and they actually often turn out to be correct statements. There are 
particular risks that are associated with them, but you now have to compare that 
to what we’re doing today.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>It’s basically an argument about the precautionary principle versus our 
technologically-oriented tendency to just recognize and manage, quantitate and 
manage risks. That, again, is a good policy discussion that has nothing to do 
with biotechnology. The problem as I see it, being a technologist, the 
precaution is you never know when not doing something is actually more damaging 
that doing something. To the physician, the challenge is do no harm, but does 
doing something do less harm than not doing something is the dilemma.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, all of that abstract thought got put into a regulatory system here. All 
over the world there are various ways to do this. In our case, the USDA, the EPA 
and the FDA all get involved. I </P>
<P>am going to briefly touch on some of the data that you would see in step 9. 
It takes about </P>
<P>7 to 10 years to get one of these crops on the market, and there is some 
occasion for public input and public hearings at some steps, not all.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I recently chaired a writing committee for CAST, Council for Agricultural 
Science and Technology, that evaluated this system, and we suggested it needed 
more transparency. It needed to explain itself better. It needed to reach out to 
the public and engage itself in this discussion. You should have a piece of 
paper that’s a bunch of references from me, and you can download the CAST report 
from the CAST Web site which is cited on that piece of paper. There are some 
other good Web sites there. I wouldn’t read that book at the end of it until 
after listening to Alan talk. Actually “Pandora’s Picnic Basket” is a good book. 
You are certainly welcome to contact me to continue this discussion at any point 
or if you need additional information.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, there are a lot of things you could consider if you wanted to look at 
the safety of a GM food, a food derived through biotechnology. I don’t have time 
to talk about all them today. What I can do is show you a little bit of the 
kinds of data that go into the evaluation. I’m kind of hoping that you’re 
reading that list. I’ll bring it back up again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I want to focus on just a couple of points. One is toxicity. One is 
allergenicity. Then the last three points I’m going to take together. Those are 
really the three points of my talk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>We know how to measure a couple of things. One is human exposure. You all 
recognize that exposure and dose are pretty important concepts. If we are going 
to put a biotech food in the market, the first thing we do is we say, well, 
what’s the new thing in it? Usually a protein. How often will people eat it? How 
much will they eat? That kind of calculation can be done from dietary food 
consumption surveys which are broken down by ethnicity, by income level, by 
gender, by age. We can get a handle on how much people are going to eat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>So then, what is it they’re going to eat? Well, we put some new proteins in 
there. Cry proteins are insecticidal proteins that are put in corn or potatoes. 
Bt is the common name for them. We have technology to evaluate their acute 
toxicity. I mean, that’s old business. And we can look at them and we can see 
that when fed at grams per kilogram per day, these Cry proteins have no effect 
on various kinds of laboratory model systems. And that’s million fold or greater 
over what they’re going to appear in the diet. So in terms of acute toxicity, 
it’s not really a problem.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The reason for that is several fold. One is that they’re not stable to 
digestion or food processing, as you can see in columns 3 and 4. The other 
reason is that these toxins act by a very specific mechanism. They attach 
themselves to a special receptor on the gastrointestinal or foregut cells of 
insects, and that receptor is missing from almost all other cells. It’s only 
specific kinds of insects that have the receptor for this specific Cry that 
causes them harm. So it’s a specific molecular mechanism that’s missing. These 
Cry proteins do not in fact even attach themselves to human gastrointestinal 
epithelial cells. So you have really no basis for action.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But I do want you to note Cry 9C. Cry 9C is the offending protein that got 
StarLink corn pulled off the market. It was not approved for use in food because 
of — look at column 3. I mean column 2. It’s no more toxic than any of the rest 
of them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>NOEL, by the way, is “No Observable Effect Level.” These things cause no 
effect.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Column 3, it is slightly stable to digestion down there. Cry 9C, one up from 
the bottom. And it’s only partially destroyed by food processing. Well, it may 
not be toxic, but that causes another problem and that’s seen in the next 
slide.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>We can’t work our way through the whole allergenicity assessment, but let me 
divide this slide into two sides. On the left side, if I take a gene from a 
plant that is known, whose products are known to cause human food allergy, then 
I might be concerned that that gene would encode an allergen in the new 
food.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, fortunately — unfortunately for them but fortunately for the scientists 
— there are people whose serum has antibodies that react with that allergen 
because they are allergic. And so I can use victims of food allergy to test 
through their serum, through skin prick tests and even through feeding 
challenges whether I’ve cloned an allergen. So in a sense if you work with genes 
from food allergens, it’s easy to tell whether you’ve cloned the allergen 
gene.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>What’s difficult — and by the way, companies won’t do that because they’re 
afraid people won’t like the perception that they’re working with a food 
allergen and transferring a gene from a known food allergen, so they have all 
sworn that they won’t do that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>If you go to the right side, if something has never been in the human diet 
before or has never been at the concentration that it now is in the new plant 
you made, the only thing you can do is say does it look like a food allergen at 
the level of sequence? Well, if it doesn’t look like a food allergen at the 
level of protein sequence, is it stable to digestion and processing? Well, if 
it’s destroyed, it’s probably not going to bother anybody if it’s destroyed in 
the stomach, right? But what happens if it’s partially stable to digesting and 
processing like Cry 9C? Well, you don’t know whether it’s an allergen or not. It 
is a property of most food allergens that they are at least partially stable or 
wholly stable to digestion and processing because the whole protein has to 
present itself to the gastrointestinal immune cells to even begin to sensitize 
an individual. So that stability sets off a bell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now, you haven’t proven this is an allergen. What you have proven is that you 
can’t tell whether it’s an allergen or not. And that should be enough to move on 
to another project which is, I think, what we should have done with Cry 9C 
frankly.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Human food allergy is, I think, getting more attention, as well it should, 
having nothing to do with biotechnology. You know, 6 to 8 percent of children 
under 10 suffer from food allergy. One to 2 percent of adults, depending upon 
how you measure it, suffer from food allergy. Most of the major foods we eat 
cause quite a few people problems. I mean, look at those foods that are the 
major allergens. Pretty common foods.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are 160 or 200 very specific food allergens that have been 
characterized as well that may affect no more than one or two people in a single 
report in the literature. So many other foods can be food allergens, but it’s 
primarily the foods we eat that have high concentrations of proteins that 
specifically bother us. For example, people that are allergic to crustaceans are 
reacting to the tropomyosin, one of the major muscle proteins in that 
crustacean. We don’t know why, and that’s the problem. We not only don’t know 
why, for most of these allergens we don’t know what the threshold is for 
sensitization or how often a person has to be exposed before they start to have 
allergic reactions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This is kind of sad because 200 people a year die in this country from 
anaphylactic reactions to eating foods that they are allergic to, often in 
disguised form. They didn’t realize they were eating it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So we don’t understand this at the molecular level. We don’t know what the 
features of the molecules are that cause this problem. We don’t have a 
predictive model, and we don’t have an animal model which will allow us to 
predict what’s an allergen. I suggest that we need to be spending some time 
trying to help people that have food allergy and trying to understand food 
allergy, and maybe biotech is going to help us because it has brought it to our 
attention.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>New foods are not tested. I can put any food on the market without doing an 
allergy evaluation, except a biotech food. We have lots of foods that contain 
allergens on the market. We primarily use labeling, which is sometimes 
inadequate unfortunately to protect people from allergens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, I showed you this list before. I have to try to be brief, so let me 
tell you about three of them at the end all together. How can we tell if the 
nutritional value, the composition are the same, and that we haven’t done 
anything unintended to the food? Well, let me zip through these.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>We can do composition studies, and we can measure hundreds of intercellular 
metabolites, and we will come to the conclusion if they’re the same that the 
plant hasn’t been changed appreciably. In fact, we focus most of our attention 
on any differences that we see. You all recognize that metabolism is a vast 
interconnected and interactive network of compounds, and we can take solace from 
the fact that if I measure a few hundred points in that big network that the 
whole thing will be largely the same, the intermediates and the pathways will be 
the same.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But the fact is we haven’t proven that the whole food is safe. We can never 
prove the whole food is safe. The people who are concerned about this know that 
we haven’t proven the whole food is safe. It is even hard, if not impossible, to 
do a whole food testing study. What are you going to do? Get a bunch of people 
to eat tomatoes at 90 percent of their diet? Are you going to do that for years 
to see what’s going to happen to them? It’s very hard to do that kind of 
human-subjects research, and obviously you want them to take a big dose of 
whatever it is you’re testing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Really, biotech foods have been subjected to what is a drug paradigm for 
testing rather than a food [paradigm], and those of us that work in the food 
area know that whole foods testing just doesn’t work. Hard to do. So what we 
have done is we have focused on, as I say, on the differences and tried to prove 
that the differences in the new things are not dangerous. And we have contented 
ourselves with the notion that composition is a powerful indicator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, some have asked why we don’t do either prospectively or retrospectively 
human dietary studies. And besides the reasons I just cited, there is a lot of 
noise in the population. There’s a lot of morbidity. There’s a lot of mortality. 
There’s a lot of diet-related disease out there. There’s a lot going on, and 
it’s just frankly we do not have the epidemiological power in a free living 
population eating a mixed and varied diet to dissect out what we might attribute 
to the many different GM foods in the diet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; . the risks presented by these foods are the same as 
presented by other foods. They are no different, and we can manage them by the 
same techniques that we have managed the risks presented by other foods. That’s 
the most you can say. A lot of different agencies and experts have looked at it 
and they accept that we can do that risk management, that what we can conclude 
is that this technology is as safe as or safer than conventional breeding 
technologies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Let me spend the last couple of minutes, though, talking about how consumers 
feel about that. You know consumers don’t have to use science. They just have to 
decide do I like it or not. If I tell you earthworms are really healthy and you 
should eat earthworms, I don’t think I’d convince many people to eat earthworms. 
Consumers worry about wholesomeness, taste, quality and frankly perception. And 
consumers have had perceptions about messing around with genetics and about the 
ways technology can go wrong for a long time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>This is the medical risk benefit analysis I referred to earlier. Here’s 
Jenner giving people cowpox. There was a big movement against this. He’s giving 
them cowpox because he thinks he’s going to make them immune to the biggest 
killer of man, of humankind in history, until it was wiped out recently — 
smallpox. And there’s an anti-vaccine society that publishes this cartoon. There 
were protests against this. People said he was playing God with nature and he 
was interfering with God’s plan and that there was a genetic danger. Notice the 
little cows growing out of the subjects. They’ve been transformed by the cowpox 
virus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I don’t put this to belittle people’s response at all. That is not the spirit 
in which I mean it. What I am suggesting is these kinds of fears are fundamental 
to a very important process, and that is we protect ourselves from new 
technologies by being very careful with them and treating them with all due 
caution.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, if we’re going to do genetic manipulation, what does the consumer know 
about genetic manipulation? I suppose you’re going to say not very much. Well, I 
thought so for a while, and then I realized consumers know a lot about genetic 
manipulation. Can you all see the T-Rex there? He’s the product of a bunch of 
white-robed scientists who went into the laboratory and whacked together some 
DNA from amphibians and ancient dinosaurs that they got cloned out of amber. The 
mathematician who is about to get munched is the one who is saying, “Chaos 
theory dictates that things happen in strange and unpredictable ways, and this 
is not going to end up very good.” And he was right. Well, he did get away but 
so did the dinosaur. Remember, nature has a way of escaping the best laid plans 
of mice and men. These things were programmed to be sterile, but they are out 
there breeding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>We could have a long symposium about all the social and political messages 
that are buried in “Jurassic Park.” Actually, it is a very good vehicle for 
explaining how most people who read science fiction and watch TV are going to 
think about this technology. It is bringing pollution to life. The people who 
brought us “Frankenstein” and “Jurassic Park” have brought us “Frankenfoods,” 
and they’re asking us as consumers to eat them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>To be honest, we really don’t know a lot about it. If you make the statement 
— I’ve got a few slides from Tom Hoban who does this kind of work. If you make 
the statement, true or false, ordinary tomatoes do not contain genes while 
genetically modified ones do, there are some people — but surprisingly few — who 
know that that’s a false statement. It depends on what country you’re in. There 
are some people who I often say are off watching television and just aren’t sure 
about that. There are an amazing number of people, depending upon the country, 
who really believe that statement is true.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Worse yet, if you make the statement, eating a genetically modified fruit, a 
person’s genes could also be changed, there are a fair number of people that 
know that that statement is not true. Except look at us and Germany where they 
really don’t like genetically modified foods. Well, possibly the reason why, if 
I can flip on here, is that a lot of them believe that those foods are going to 
genetically transform their own genes. I wouldn’t like them either if that’s 
what I believed. So I think we have an educational challenge here. There are 
certainly real issues, but those aren’t the issues.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So the question is, if you don’t have the knowledge yourself, what do you do? 
Well, you turn to an authority. And guess who the authority is? At least in this 
country, more people believe physicians than any other sources of scientific 
information about this and essentially, as you heard before, almost all science. 
You’re at the front lines.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>We have a journalist in the audience. I would point out something to him as 
well about this chart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This whole issue is a question of whom you trust. Notice that an appreciable 
percentage of people do not in fact trust some of those organizations at the 
top. Those people will never be satisfied by the safety evaluation that’s being 
done and they will have deep and legitimate concerns. You’re talking about 10 to 
20 percent of the population. To a food manufacturer, that’s serious. They don’t 
want to make a product that 10 to 20 percent of the people have misgivings 
about.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I’m going to skip over this. It was just a health benefit of 
biotechnology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>What I worry about in terms of public health is that the real food safety 
challenge is food-borne illness. Nine thousand people a year die in this 
country. Seventy million go to the emergency room or the hospital. I worry about 
people making bad diet choices and obesity in this country. We know that that 
leads to a lot of morbidity and mortality. I worry about a lot of other things 
that you can see on this list, some of which I can even think of biotech 
solutions for.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But the last thing that I worry about is food safety of biotech foods. But 
then I’ve been there and I’ve seen all the data and this is what I do. Somebody 
not as familiar with this might not feel the same way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I’m going to leave this out. I’m just going to say there’s an article here 
and I cite it. You can get it off the IFT Web site. It’s about how people 
perceive risks. Basically, the situation with biotech foods exactly describes 
what makes a consumer scared, which would be the left column there. All the 
attributes of a risk that people are going to be bothered by are the way biotech 
foods are in the market now. The right column doesn’t scare them is what you’d 
like to achieve with any food.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Let me close by saying that the noted pollster and scholar on how public 
opinion is formed, Daniel Yankelovich, is actually studying the biotech 
controversy because he thinks it’s a really good model for something that he’s 
concerned about, and that is that we seem to be less able to resolve these kind 
of issues in what we call our industrialized, civilized society, rather than 
better able with all of our communication, which you might expect.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The least we could have is good information to work with. By that I don’t 
mean that we should all go out and convince people biotechnology is good. What 
we should do is equip people with critical thinking skills and a knowledge of 
science that allows them to decide what’s appropriate for them and what conforms 
with their values and what doesn’t. It’s already been said we need that 
education to have democratic processes like informed decision making, and we 
need leadership from trusted authorities.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>And so let me close by saying, I think the AMA and its members have to take 
an active leadership role in that educational process. Thank you. [applause]</P>
<P><B>Dr. Abromowitz</B></P>
<P>Thank you, Bruce, for superb information. I wish we had more time, ladies and 
gentlemen, but we are on kind of a short fuse this morning.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So I would like to go forward by introducing our next panelist. Leonard 
Gianessi is here from Peoria, Ill. He told me to mention that, by the way. He 
serves as the current Program Director and Senior Research Associate at the 
National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy. Leonard is a widely published 
expert in the fields of pesticides and biotechnology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>His most recent undertaking involves a 40 commodity study to determine the 
potential implications of transgenics on many U.S. crops. This morning Leonard 
will talk about some of the environmental benefits of biotechnology. Leonard, we 
welcome you. Thank you very much.</P><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" 
clear=all>
<P><B>Leonard Gianessi, Program Director, National Center for Food and 
Agriculture Policy</B></P>
<P>I am going to talk about biotechnology and its potential to manage pests. 
It’s apropos because </P>
<P>the products that have been introduced so far for American agriculture have 
this purpose. </P>
<P>Pest management.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>These are the kinds of cultivars that have been developed and introduced. 
Herbicide tolerant crops. Take some genetic material out of a soil 
microorganism. Put it into a soybean plant. You can spray an herbicide that 
would normally kill the soybeans. Insecticidal crops. Engineered cultivars 
containing a toxin out of a soil microorganism turns the plant into an 
insecticide able to kill insects that try to feed on it. Virus resistant crops. 
Take some genetic material from a virus. Engineer it into a plant. The plant has 
got immunity. It can’t get the virus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Those three crops have been introduced in the U.S. The bacterial resistant 
crops are under development. Take some foreign genetic material perhaps from an 
animal species or another plant, put it into a plant and bacterial cells are 
killed then by the plant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>We literally have planted tens of millions of acres in the United States with 
these transgenic crops already. As you can see, 40 million acres of soybeans, 15 
million acres of insecticidal corn. That Bt corn that Bruce was talking about 
has been engineered to kill insects. Fewer acres of the virus resistant crops, 
but they’re pretty important. That thousand acres of papaya, I’ll talk about how 
important that was.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This is the way the herbicide technology works. The plants on the left, 
called the Round-Up Ready cotton plants, they’ve been engineered with a protein 
from a soil microorganism. Allows them to withstand the herbicide that, as you 
can see on the right side, the non-Round-Up Ready cotton doesn’t have that 
protection against the herbicide and so it’s killed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>An herbicide tolerant cotton has been rapidly adopted in the U.S. You can see 
these numbers for California. Coming out of nowhere just a couple of years ago, 
it’s already out there on about </P>
<P>30 percent of the acres. And why is that?</P>
<P>Well, scenes like this in California cotton have been all too common right up 
through the 1990s. There are many weeds that can only be controlled with hand 
weeding. There are many weeds that the normal herbicides will not control. This 
is very expensive and antiquated technology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So here is what we think has happened in California just in the last three 
years. California, by adopting this technology on 30 percent of the acres, 
they’ve already saved $14 million. That hand weeding is expensive. This is 
better technology. It controls more weeds at lower cost.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am going to talk about soybeans. We don’t eat soybeans directly, but 
they’re in a heck of a lot of the processed foods in the supermarket. Soybean 
proteins are added to breads and cereals, candy bars, chocolate candy, 
mayonnaise, peanut butter. There is soybean oil and proteins in about 80 percent 
of the foods in our process stores.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Increasingly those soybean oils and proteins are coming from what’s called 
Round-Up Ready soybeans. These are the transgenic soybeans. You can see that 
acreage in the U.S. has </P>
<P>increased dramatically.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This kind of tells you why. These are soybeans with weeds infesting the 
field. You have to control those weeds otherwise your soybean yields are going 
to go down. You’ve got three or four different kind of weeds in there. Under the 
normal strategies, growers would have to use three or four different herbicides 
to kill the weeds in this field. Or they can plant the Round-Up Ready soybeans. 
These are the transgenic soybeans. You can spray one herbicide, Round-Up, over 
the top and kill all the weeds. So instead of using four herbicides, growers can 
use </P>
<P>one herbicide.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>These are some of the cost estimates. We’re doing a study. We’re saying, 
well, what would happen if the growers didn’t have this? Well, they would switch 
back to using three or four other herbicides at a greater cost. You can see 
certain states like New York and South Dakota where they have really tough 
perennial weed species, their cost would be $26, $33 more an acre. In big 
soybean states like Illinois, maybe $12 an acre.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But growers adopt technology if it’s more effective, if it’s cheaper. We’ve 
got 40 million acres of these Round-Up Ready soybeans. Take it away from 
American growers, they’ll be spending $700 million on other technologies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Talk about California process tomatoes. It’s a real powerhouse. [Many] pounds 
of process tomatoes coming out of California. Forty percent of the world’s 
supply of pizza sauce, tomato paste, tomato sauce coming from this state. But 
increasingly a lot of competition worldwide.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>These are weeds in tomatoes and they have to control these weeds to get a 
crop in California. They do a lot of different things. One of the weed control 
methods they use out here is fumigation. This tractor is injecting a poisonous 
gas into the soil to kill germinating weed seeds. Very expensive.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>They do a lot of hand weeding. Again, these workers in the United States, $6 
an hour, $7 an hour. In other countries, $6 a day. It’s very expensive.</P>
<P>This may be a solution for our growers. Again, this is a row of tomato plants 
where the weeds are in there. In order to get those out, they’ve been 
genetically engineered so that an herbicide can go over the top and take out all 
the weeds and leave the tomatoes just fine. Don’t need to use fumigation. Don’t 
need to use hand labor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>And so in our study, we project — this technology isn’t available to the 
growers right now. But what if it were available to California tomato growers? 
We figure they would save $30 million a year. This is a crop that’s in financial 
trouble. Trouble competing internationally. If you want to keep this crop in the 
United States, we’ve got to figure out ways of reducing costs. This is cheaper, 
more effective technology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>This is a sugar beet. We get 9 billion pounds out of that beet. It’s about 15 
percent sugar. Sugar beet growers use a heck of a lot of herbicide applications. 
They apply herbicides three to four times, and every time they spray, they’re 
using three or four different pesticides in that spray can. So they’re making 16 
applications of different herbicides to kill different kinds of seed species. In 
addition, they are cultivating twice and they’re using four hours of hand labor. 
This is an extraordinarily expensive technology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This is an alternative. This is Round-Up Ready sugar beets in the foreground. 
You can see one application of Round-Up over those sugar beets take out all the 
weeds. No need to cultivate. No need to hand weed. No need to use 16 
applications. Look at the traditional ones in the background. Using the 
traditional herbicides, you see all those weeds that are in there? That’s why 
they have to have hand weeding and cultivation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>At the end of the season, you’ve got this kind of sugar beet with two 
applications of Round-Up. This technology has been available for U.S. sugar beet 
growers for the last three or four years.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Here’s what we think would happen if American growers adopted this 
technology. It would save $60 an acre. The whole industry would save $94 
million. Again, this is a crop that’s in financial difficulty in the United 
States. If they adopted this technology, it would save almost </P>
<P>$100 million.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Here are the adoption numbers for the United States. Not a single one of 
these Round-Up Ready sugar beets is being planted in the United States. It’s 
been available since 1999. It would save the industry $100 million, but because 
big candy manufacturers like Hershey’s, they’ve gone to the sugar beet 
processors and they said if you approve the planting of any of these sugar 
beets, we will not buy sugar from your mill. So not a single sugar beet mill in 
the United States has approved the planting of these varieties. So these 
benefits are what we call foregone benefits. We are giving them up because of 
this controversy that Bruce described about genetic engineering.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, Dr. Johnson said you’ve got talk a little bit about sugar cane so he’d 
feel comfortable, coming from Louisiana, because they grow some sugar cane down 
there and we get a few billion pounds of refined sugar out of this cane. Indeed, 
they’ve got weed problems. They’ve got billions of buried weed seeds in that 
rich fertile soil down there, and if they didn’t control them, we’re not going 
to get that billion pounds of sugar.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So a colleague of mine actually transformed sugar cane to be tolerant of the 
herbicide. You see the plant on the left? The green sugar cane. You can spray 
one of these broad spectrum herbicides over that. You see the one on the right 
that the herbicide would normally kill.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>These are some take home messages for Dr. Johnson to go back to Louisiana and 
say if they got this technology in Louisiana, it’s under development right now, 
these are these impacts we think they would have. A reduction of 2 million 
pounds of herbicide use. Weed control costs go down by $15 million. Production 
goes up by $16 million. Real tangible benefits to growers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>These are two cotton bolls. The one on the right has been genetically 
improved. It’s got that toxin in that Bruce described — the Bt toxin. The insect 
takes a tiny little bite, gets a little bit of the toxin, goes off and dies. The 
one on the left is the traditional cotton boll. As you can see, if you want to 
control that insect, you’ve got to use something external like insecticides.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Because of all the planting of this kind of cotton in the United States, this 
transgenic cotton, which is out there as I showed you on most of the cotton 
acreage, American growers are spraying 2.7 million pounds fewer insecticides 
into the environment every year. Instead of having to spray the insecticides, 
they are planting the cotton that kills the insects on its own.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>These are sweet corn. Now, they are grown in Florida. Let me assure you that 
if they didn’t use insecticides down there just about every one of their sweet 
corn would be damaged with insects. And so they spray. We’ve heard a lot about 
those crop dusters down in Belle Glade, Florida. Well, guess what they do all 
winter? They’re out there spraying fresh sweet corn. Florida is our number one 
fresh sweet corn-producing state and the corn down there is sprayed 10, 12, 15 
times every year with insecticides.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is an alternative. This is commercially available. It’s Bt sweet corn. 
It’s the cob on the right. Again, it’s got the toxin from the soil 
microorganism. The insect takes a tiny little bite and goes off and dies. The 
one on the left has to be sprayed 10 or 15 times. This is commercially 
available. This has been available for several years.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>In our study, here’s what we project for Florida. They could reduce their 
insecticide sprays. We thought that’s what consumers wanted. Their costs would 
go down by 40 bucks an acre. It’s great technology. It’s better than what 
they’re currently doing. They would save money, produce more. This looks like a 
win-win situation. So how much are they planting? In Florida, they’re planting 
none. They’ve decided that even though it’s great technology and it’s been 
commercially available since 1999, they started a little bit in ‘99, they got so 
concerned about this debate that Bruce talked about, they said we can’t do this. 
We cannot plant this. We cannot take the risk in the marketplace of being 
rejected. So, again, we’re giving up these benefits because of this debate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now, I’ll talk about the virus resistant crops. This is papaya in Hawaii. We 
got about 70 million pounds in the early ‘90s. You can see that dropped off in 
the mid-90s and then it started to come back. This is a biotech story. It’s 
those 1,000 acres of papaya.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Papaya is susceptible to this virus, papaya ring spot virus. It’s spread by 
insects. It gets inside the plant. There’s no way to eradicate it. What they 
were doing in the mid-90s was chopping down papaya trees. You lose a lot of 
production real fast if you’ve got a virus and the only way you can treat it is 
to cut down the infected trees, and that’s what they were doing. This was going 
to go straight to zero.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>But genetic engineers engineered those papaya trees that you see on the 
right. Those big tall green bushy trees. They have a little bit of the virus 
gene engineered into their genome, and so what they’re able to do is when the 
virus gets into the plant, it just will not spread. It will not spread. It will 
not take over the plants. As you see, the ones on the left, those wilting 
shorter plants, the virus is in there taking over the plant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>And no less a source than the <I>New York Times</I> said let’s give credit 
where credit is due. This genetically engineered papaya is being planted in 
Hawaii and has saved the industry. It’s only a 1,000 acres but it’s going to 
keep us in those 70 million pounds of papaya we’re getting </P>
<P>from Hawaii.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This is another disease. This is a virus disease known as crustacea. It kills 
citrus trees. This disease has killed 45 million trees in Latin America. It’s 
moving up. It threatens the </P>
<P>United States particularly in Texas. So they have genetically engineered 
citrus trees in Texas because this disease has killed so many trees in Latin 
America. It’s knocking on Texas’ door. It’s right there in Mexico. They’ve got 
to get ready. These trees have been genetically engineered. They have some of 
the crustacea genetic material and they’re testing them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now finally I’ll talk a little bit about bacteria. These are bacterial cells. 
They just sort of float around in the environment. They’re out there. They land 
on susceptible tissue being spread by the wind. They look for a little opening 
in the susceptible tissue. They’ll go in and infect a plant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>This is an apple that’s starting to show some infection from a bacterial 
spore known as fire blight. This is a bacteria that’s fairly common in the 
United States. This is an apple that’s got a real bad [case] of fire blight. You 
see all that bacterial ooze. It’s just filled with bacteria, oozing bacteria. 
Wind and rain will spread the bacteria throughout the orchard. We are having an 
epidemic of this kind of problem in American orchards.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So what do they do? Well, to kill bacteria in an orchard they’re spraying 
antibiotics. This is a grower that’s going through spraying antibiotics to kill 
the bacteria in the orchards. I just wanted to show you what those antibiotics 
are that they’re using. Streptomycin, oxytetracycline. Nobody likes this. 
Spraying antibiotics into the environment. There are some resistant fire blight 
populations out there. This is not something that anybody really likes. These 
are important antibiotics for humans as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So what genetic engineers at Cornell University did was they identified some 
proteins that are in the giant silkworm genome, and these proteins kill 
bacterial cells. These lactic proteins, when they get near plant bacteria, they 
attach themselves to the bacteria. They punch a hole in the bacteria and the 
bacteria dies. And they were able to genetically engineer these proteins into an 
apple.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>And so there they are. The ones on the right, the biotech Galas, they’ve been 
genetically engineered with the protein from the giant silkworm so that they 
actually kill the fire blight bacteria if it gets into them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now, they’re sort of sitting on the shelf. You can see they look like an 
apple. They taste like an apple. They yield like an apple. In every other way 
they’re an apple. They’ve got this new protein in them that allows them to kill 
bacterial cells. Whether or not this will be registered in the United States, we 
don’t know. It would have to be registered as a pesticide. That’s a very 
expensive thing to do. And the apple industry, frankly, they’re not interested 
in another public relations nightmare about their crop, and so they’re just 
saying leave this on the shelf until we do something about this debate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>And so that winds it up. Like Herman mentioned, we’re doing a study of 40 
case studies for </P>
<P>30 crops. There are lots of other crops that are being genetically engineered 
in the United States. We will complete that in May. I would encourage you to 
visit our Web site, and we will be posting all of these studies with results 
state by state so that you would see numbers for your state as part of this 
study.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thank you very much. [applause]</P>
<P><B>Dr. Abromowitz</B></P>
<P>Thank you, Leonard. That was quite a fascinating topic. As a young fellow who 
was raised in rural southwestern Ohio on the farm, it’s kind of interesting to 
see all that. Thank you very much.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Our last and final speaker is coming up and that is to be followed — and I 
encourage you to think about your question now for the Q&amp;A by Dr. Ron Davis 
at the conclusion of our final panelist.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>He is Dr. Alan McHughen. Alan comes to us from the University of California 
Riverside. He’s a molecular geneticist with an interest in crop improvement and 
received his doctorate from Oxford University. As an educator and consumer 
advocate, Alan works to help non-scientists understand the environmental and 
health impacts of both modern and traditional methods of food production. This 
morning Alan will talk about biotechnology as it relates to public policy in 
</P>
<P>the medium.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Alan, thank you very much. Welcome.</P><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" 
clear=all>
<P><B>Alan McHughen, D.Phil., University of California, Riverside</B></P>
<P>Yeah, it’s good to be here. It’s really a tough act to follow. We have today 
on this panel four very diverse people coming from very different backgrounds, 
the medical community, food technology industry and I’m a genetic engineer. </P>
<P>I use genetic engineering to improve our crops. I work for a public 
university and have done so for 20 years, and I got into the policy development 
and public education role because, as we saw in one of the previous slides, 
people put a great degree of trust in the family physician followed by, well the 
FDA in this country, but otherwise, in Canada where I spent the last 20 years, 
by public scientists.</P>
<P>So people would call me with questions. They’d say, you know, I wanted to 
talk to my physician about this but I can’t get to see him for the next month 
and so then I’m calling you. Of course, I’m always in my office answering these 
calls from farmers who want to know about the price of corn this week.</P>
<P>But overwhelmingly, when you talk about biotechnology the first question is, 
is this food safe, you know, nothing is absolutely safe. Conventional foods 
present some degree of risk, but most of us are willing to accept those risks in 
order to continue living.</P>
<P>The next question they say is, you know, you medical people and scientists 
are all alike. Can </P>
<P>you never give us a straight yes or no answer? And, of course, then you have 
to say, well, it depends. [laughter]</P>
<P>People are confused. People are very anxious about new technologies. 
Sometimes they are very supportive. Sometimes they are extremely skeptical. But 
it behooves us to provide them with accurate information so that they can then 
conduct a debate with themselves, as Bruce said, to see how these technologies 
fit in with their own values and then come to their own determination as to 
whether they wish to support them or not.</P>
<P>And so I don’t really call myself an advocate of biotechnology although I see 
tremendous benefits. I also see tremendous risks. And I certainly advocate 
appropriate regulation to ensure that we mitigate the risks that we manage the 
risks in order to most effectively benefit from the tremendous advantages that 
this technology offers.</P>
<P>Now, again, one of the popular questions that people have, one of the 
concerns, is that these things get on the market with no regulatory oversight. 
Companies create these Frankenstein foods, put them out, give them to farmers 
and they end up on the shelves. And nobody really has looked to see whether 
there is something wrong with them or not. As I mentioned, I develop crops using 
both conventional technologies and genetic engineering.</P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>My colleagues and I developed a conventional variety. I work with flax, which 
produces </P>
<P>Omega 3 oils. You might have heard of those. And it takes several years to 
develop these things. We have to do some tests. There is some regulatory 
oversight but it’s fairly minimal. This is the dossier that I needed to provide 
our regulatory officials. It’s about 30 pages long, contains information on 
various aspects of the performance of this new line. We have to show how it 
performs on the farm, the agronomic performance, its yield and so on.</P>
<P>Almost all foods contain anti-nutritional substances. People don’t like to 
think about that, but in the case of flax these are cyanogenic leucocytes. 
There’s also fairly rudimentary nutritional analysis. This is the proximate 
analysis. In the case of the cyanogenic leucocytes, we want to make sure that 
just the normal breeding process, the conventional breeding, does not elevate 
the levels of [making adjustments to the microphone].</P>
<P>In conventional breeding occasionally we see things like increased levels of 
cyanogenic leucocytes that have nothing to do with the breeding attributes of 
the higher yield or the early maturity, whatever. So we have to monitor these 
things. That’s fine. That’s fair and that’s the way the system works.</P>
<P>There’s a lot of genetic information added to that CDC Normandy variety. I 
don’t have a clue what it is. There’s DNA in there that’s been rearranged. 
There’re new promoters. There’re deleted promoters. There may be pieces of 
chromosomes that are lost. We don’t have a clue what they are, but that material 
ends up on the market and historically we know that for the most part it’s not a 
big deal.</P>
<P>Now, we also developed, my colleagues and I, a genetically engineered version 
of flax. And this one we had the same concerns. We took it out to the field. We 
did some tests on it, but the regulatory people had a few more questions for us. 
By the time we compiled the dossier and submitted it, the dossier looked like 
this.</P>
<P>So when people come to me and they say these things get on the market with no 
regulatory oversight, I pull out this slide and show them that some of the 
questions that had to answer were in addition to the same questions we had for a 
conventional variety, that is it’s agronomic performance, whether the cyanogenic 
leucocyte content in it had increased, we also had to provide information on all 
these other things as well.</P>
<P>Now, we’re not going to go through these, but just to give you an idea that 
we do have to consider things like allergenicity that we don’t with conventional 
products. We had to do things like the horizontal gene transfer, you know, the 
environmental question of what happens? Is this more likely to get out, to 
escape into the wild and become a weed of agriculture or interfere with our 
wilderness areas? So those are some of the questions that we had to answer in 
terms of the regulatory process.</P><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" 
clear=all>
<P>Two very simple points. We do eat DNA all the time, alright? Some people are 
concerned that this genetic engineering adds something new to our diet, but I 
think the slides that Bruce showed about people’s attitudes toward eating DNA 
and whether the DNA from a genetically modified plant or biotech plant will 
change their own DNA is quite telling. It certainly sets a standard for us. It 
gives us something to do in terms of public education.</P>
<P>Now, are there any Australians in the room? I love Australia. It’s a great 
place. I was there on sabbatical. Wonderful people. They’re the most down to 
earth, pragmatic folks you will ever encounter. There is no pretentiousness 
there at all.</P>
<P>Bruce’s survey didn’t show this, but a similar survey came out from Australia 
recently showing that they were the most likely people to accept genetically 
modified foods. They have the fewest qualms about eating genetically modified 
foods. At the same time, they were amongst the most likely people to believe 
that eating genetically modified foods would change their own </P>
<P>genes. [laughter]</P>
<P>You know, I can’t explain it, but people do have funny conceptions about what 
they’re eating, where it comes from. Conventional foods. We talk about the 
reduction in pesticide use. Well, a lot of people don’t realize that we’re using 
pesticides conventionally and every day you’re eating a tiny residue of 
pesticides. These have been approved, of course, at the limits, but people don’t 
like to think about what they’re eating.</P>
<P>Our society is generally complacent about food and food production. As long 
as it’s there on </P>
<P>the shelves, as long as it’s cheap, as long as it looks good, then they don’t 
need to worry too much about the production itself. So we have a problem because 
the industry doesn’t like to remind people of what conventional foods are and 
whether biotechnology is going to be better or worse than the status quo. People 
don’t know what the status quo is, so how can they make </P>
<P>these determinations?</P>
<P>Well, one of the things I did was look at, you know, if you go to your whole 
food store and buy a kilo of wheat, what’s in it? I like to show this to people 
just to remind them that this is conventional stuff. This is not genetic 
engineering. We do not have genetically modified wheat on the market yet. It’s 
coming. Get ready.</P>
<P>So if we analyze that kilo of wheat grain, we’d find that there’s about 680 
grams of starch. Not a surprise. Ah, there’s some protein in there. Some 
moisture. A little bit of oil, you know, 20 grams of oil out of the kilo of the 
wheat grains. Some fiber and ash, of course.</P>
<P>And then we get into the more interesting stuff. There’re some stones. 
There’s a little bit of glass and probably some other seeds. I mean weeds grow 
up in the wheat field. It just gets mixed in. We don’t like to see them there, 
but we can’t eliminate them entirely.</P>
<P>Now, most people look at that and say, okay, that makes sense. Right, I mean, 
this is natural product. You’re going to get weeds. You’re going to get a little 
bit of stone. I don’t like the glass, but as long as it’s only 2 grams per kilo, 
I guess we can deal with that.</P>
<P>Then there’s some other interesting stuff as well. I mean, there are legs and 
wings — and we’re not talking about Colonel Sanders’ products here. These are, 
of course, there are zillions of insects in the wheat field. They get mixed in 
during the harvest and legs and wings are in there. People don’t like to think 
about this, but amongst those legs and wings are lots of genes. </P>
<P>There’s lots of DNA. There’re promoters. There’s RNA. Things that people 
don’t put into the final calculation.</P>
<P>Now, in addition to that we have a little bit — now I know in this audience 
[laughter]. You know I prepared this slide mostly when I’m talking to farm 
groups to remind them. Of course, they accept all this. But in case you’re not 
sure, this means fecal matter [laughter]. And we’re allowed about 9 milligrams 
of that stuff in a kilo of wheat grain.</P>
<P>We also have some other nasty stuff — aflatoxin. We’re allowed to have 
aflatoxin in this wheat grain. We’re allowed to have a little bit of DDT. We’re 
even allowed to have a little bit of arsenic, 25 micrograms of arsenic in a 
kilo. Anybody knows that they don’t want to eat arsenic. This is why we don’t 
show this slide around. It’s there. Arsenic is in our drinking water. It’s in 
all of our food. It’s in the air. You’re getting a little bit of arsenic every 
time you open </P>
<P>your mouth.</P>
<P>Now, if we had genetically modified wheat, and I say it is coming, if we do 
the calculation and figure out where does the genetically modified DNA and 
protein from that DNA fit into this chart. Well, on average we’re looking at a 
tiny amount of DNA because wheat has a very large genome relative to other 
things, a huge amount of DNA. And the amount of DNA inserted in genetic 
modification is probably immeasurable. The amount of protein on average would 
work out to be about 16 micrograms. This is less than the amount of arsenic.</P>
<P>So why are people concerned so much about the presence of new protein, 
particularly when that protein is probably something they already eat? Most of 
the food produced through biotechnology contains genes and proteins from other 
foods, things that we already consume. And what if we get a situation like we 
have — there’s a genetically modified soybean on the market. It’s been 
genetically engineered with another soybean gene. So there’s nothing foreign 
there. Does that make a difference to the attitude? In some cases it will.</P>
<P>To those of those who think scientifically, logically, objectively, we’d say, 
well, no, because we know that when harm comes to us from eating something, it’s 
because of the presence of a substance or perhaps the absence of a substance. 
But some people do not think like scientists and physicians. They’re more 
subjective and they say it’s the process that I object to. Humans are 
interfering; doing things that nature doesn’t want us to do — or God, in some 
cases. And we have to recognize that people have very deeply felt emotional 
beliefs, and we can’t just ignore them. On the other hand, we can’t subjugate 
our entire regulatory system.</P>
<P>The only common denominator, the common currency is scientific fact, and 
that’s the message I want to leave with you that we as medical people, as 
scientific people work with science. We work with facts. Facts are not subject 
to the whims of democracy or public opinion. We have to remember that when we’re 
debating these things.</P>
<P>We work with the facts. We determine if something is harmful or not. We look 
at the benefits. We weigh that against the risks and we go forward from 
there.</P>
<P>I would hope to emphasize what you have already heard today that as leaders, 
our responsibility is to lead. It is to provide accurate information. It’s not 
to tell people what to think or how to vote. But provide them with accurate 
information and ask them to consider that in the light of their own personal 
ethics and their own values.</P>
<P>I think you will find that many people will then come forward and say, yeah, 
we can use this biotechnology stuff to help clean the environment because the 
alternative is the status quo, and it’s the status quo that got us in this mess 
as it is. We can’t continue using up our resources. We can’t continue polluting 
the world the way we have been for the last 50 years.</P>
<P>We have to have a tool. Biotechnology provides a tool. We can use it for good 
if we’re careful about it, and we can help clean up our environment. We can help 
clean up our food supply. Give people more nutritious food. Getting rid of the 
mycotoxins in corn is one real life example that Bruce wasn’t able to get to, 
but it’s there. It’s already there. We’re going to have to feed more people. The 
population continues to increase. Our resources continue to diminish. So the 
status quo is not an option.</P>
<P>Let’s make sure that we use this biotechnology in a responsible way for the 
appropriate </P>
<P>public good.</P>

Q&amp;A Session</B> </P>
<P><B>Ronald M. Davis, M.D.</B></P>
<P>Herman, when he introduced me, he forgot to mention the degrees that I have. 
Besides my MD, I also have a DQAM, which is a doctorate in Q&amp;A moderation. 
So that’s why this role has been saved for me. I actually took an entire course 
on how to moderate a Q&amp;A session when you’re totally out of time. That’s the 
situation in which we find ourselves right now.</P>
<P>But we fortunately have a 30-minute gap between when we’re supposed to end 
this session and the beginning of the next plenary. So my recommendation would 
be that we go about 10 minutes with questions and then break at a quarter ‘til. 
That will give you 15 minutes to get to the plenary or to do whatever you need 
to do. If anybody, of course, wants to stay on longer and talk to the speakers 
individually, I imagine they’d be able to stay a little bit longer for that.</P>

</P>
<P><B>Dr. McHughen</B></P>
<P>If I were an organic grower, I’d be out beating the drum for biotech because 
it provides an alternative for those people who, for whatever reason, don’t want 
to support the biotech and conventional agriculture and that will ensure them a 
place in the market.</P>
<P>The point of organic. At the moment there has been a lot of growth. To some 
extent I support that. What I don’t like about [it is] what I hear from organic 
people from time to time [on] the misleading claims about the healthfulness or 
the environmental sustainability or whatever else. I’d like to see some evidence 
to support those claims and, so far, it’s been completely lacking. It’s been 
assumed that organic production is safer and better for the environment and so 
on, more healthy and so on. And I just haven’t seen the evidence. But apart from 
that, I think it does provide the alternative in the marketplace for people who 
don’t like biotech.</P>
<P><B>Dr. Chassy</B></P>
<P>Production of organic food is ________ in growth. The larger the area under 
organic cultivation becomes, the more difficult it becomes. It’s very hard to do 
at scale.</P>
<P>I’m reminded of a comment I heard from, I think it was, about a 100-year-old 
Kansas farmer who said he didn’t know what all the fuss about organic was. He 
did organic farming for years until we got chemicals and pesticides, and he was 
able to do high-yield farming after he got out of the organic business.</P>
<P><B>Leonard Gianessi</B></P>
<P>Yeah, let me, when I get asked about organic farming, I say, yes, there is a 
future for organic farming. Yes, American consumers are demanding this and there 
is a future. But it’s in Latin America. And it’s in Latin America because one of 
the biggest costs is pulling all those weeds. Labor is a heck of a lot cheaper 
down there. So the niche growers in the U.S. are not going to be able to compete 
with big farms down south. And so, yeah, there is a future for it, but it isn’t 
in this country.</P>
<P><B>Dr. Johnson</B></P>
<P>I simply wanted to observe. I don’t think anybody would take any issue with 
organic production. It is a consumer choice, and I think most of us support that 
notion of giving people a choice. Where the problem comes is if they put out 
misinformation that leads the public to deny folks the choice of being able to 
take advantage of the technology, then they’ve done a disservice. It’s more than 
a competitive endeavor. Then it becomes an obstruction to progress and that’s a 
different issue.</P>
<P><B>Dr. McHughen</B></P>
<P>I’ll kick it off. I think it illustrates that biotech is a tool, and you can 
use it for a broad range of things. Hopefully, we’ll use it responsibly to 
create better products either nutritionally or environmentally, but it’s in the 
toolbox. It’s like a hammer or a screwdriver. What you choose to do with that is 
what really gives value to the final product.</P>
<P>Certainly there are some niche market areas. At the moment those niche market 
products, though, are not being rapidly developed because of the development 
costs, the concerns in the marketplace, the regulatory burden and so on. But 
eventually one hopes that smaller niche market, regional type crops with 
improvements, with real improvements, will be able to get through the research 
and development and on to the market.</P>
<P><B>Leonard Gianessi</B></P>
<P>And it sort of illustrates the advantage of this technology. I mean, crop 
breeders at Cornell have been working for a long time to try to improve the 
crops with traditional breeding. But you exchange a lot of unwanted 
characteristics when you do that and you’re sort of stuck with them.</P>
<P>With this technology you take the gene that you want and you put it in the 
most attractive cultivar you’ve got and you don’t have to worry about back 
crossing out all the undesirable traits. And so we’re seeing that increasingly 
around the country. In grapes, a lot of the genetic engineering work is being 
done at the University of Florida, and they want to put Florida grapes and wines 
back in the forefront and beat out California. So, good luck.</P><BR 
style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P><B>Dr. Chassy</B></P>
<P>I think you touched on a couple of, I think, really key essential parts of 
this. One involves trust, whether you trust in institutions or not. Some people 
will see the failure of the system to work, as you gave several examples, while 
other people will see the 99.99 percent of the time it worked. Now, it’s sort of 
the difference between people’s politics or world view. That is definitely one 
of the things that drives all this, whether you see staying within the system 
and improving it or rejecting it because it’s failed too many times, is really 
what it gets down to.</P>
<P>With regard to the specific labeling issue, what the FDA is doing, first of 
all, their policy on labeling is misunderstood. Their policy is pretty simple. 
It actually agrees with most of what the consumer advocates say. If you change a 
food in any material way, the law already says it should be labeled. So at issue 
is strictly whether a GM soybean, which is identical in composition to a 
conventional soybean, should be labeled or not.</P>
<P>That’s a different issue which we can debate, but what they have said is if 
you put a label on it that says that it’s GM free, you have to be able to prove 
that it’s GM free. To date, because we’re dealing with a commingled commodity 
stream where the soybeans are just dumped together, it’s very hard to test 
negative for GM soybeans especially when 70 percent of our production is GM.</P>
<P>So the FDA is saying if you’re going to make the claim, it has to be a 
truthful claim. That’s even worse for a consumer in a way. Put a product on the 
shelf that isn’t giving them what they’re paying extra money to get is 
fraud.</P>
<P><B>Dr. Johnson</B></P>
<P>Let me quickly just say to this issue of consumer choice, a couple of 
examples that I use. Consumers aren’t getting the choice that they may willingly 
take. If presented with the Bt sweet corn or the traditional sweet corn, I think 
a lot of consumers would take the Bt sweet corn. I know I want to taste it. But 
I’m denied that choice. I’m denied that choice in the supermarket because nobody 
will market it.</P>
<P><B>Dr. McHughen</B></P>
<P>I recognize the people who are making these points. There are some 
assumptions in there that you might like to question, but at the moment, organic 
is the alternative. If people don’t choose to support the big five companies or 
they don’t choose to support conventional agriculture, they can go to organic 
and I freely recommend that to those folks.</P>
<P>At the same time I hasten to remind them that if their motivation is to avoid 
pesticides, organic is not the way to go. I mean, we have Rotenone. We know 
about Rotenone. We know what it does. It’s a pesticide.</P>
<P><B>Participant</B></P>
<P>I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>Dr. McHughen</B></P>
<P>You don’t know? Well, it’s something to look up.</P>
<P>The organic folks are at a 5 percent tolerance for these other contaminants, 
including pesticides, herbicides, other chemicals. That’s 5 parts per 100. Yet 
zero tolerance for a soybean gene in </P>
<P>a soybean.</P>
<P>There is a misunderstanding about what organic means. Organic standards allow 
certain compounds to be used as herbicides or pesticides and certain management 
practices that were used 40 or 50 years ago which were therefore deemed to be 
traditional and good. It is not </P>
<P>no-input agriculture. In fact, things like Rotenone are extremely toxic but 
they are permitted.</P>
<P>The second thing is that being organic does not mean it’s pesticide free or 
antibiotic free. It means they have not been used deliberately in the 
production. I can go into a store and test organic fruits and vegetables and 
they all have pesticide residues. They just weren’t deliberately put there.</P>
<P><B>Leonard Gianessi</B></P>
<P>Yeah, and the example I used of the fire blight in the apples. The 
streptomycin is permitted for organic growers to use, so organic growers are 
using that. Organic growers spray sulphur in </P>
<P>New York to kill diseases. They spray copper to kill tomato diseases. They 
spray oils to smother insects. They just don’t tell you about it.</P>
<P><B>Dr. McHughen</B></P>
<P>I don’t want to get into like organic bashing, but there are places where you 
have poisonous, dangerous levels of copper in the soil because of application of 
copper in organic farming. Copper is very toxic to humans.</P>
<P><B>Dr. Davis</B></P>
<P>Let’s take one more question. Matt, you had your hand up. Did you want to ask 
a question?</P>
<P><B>Dr. Chassy</B></P>
<P>I tell you one thing about consumers. The industry that works with plants 
won’t even use a gene from an animal in making a plant. And the reason why is if 
you survey attitudes, it turns out most people — and Alan had to delete this 
from his talk — most people really like medical and pharmaceutical applications, 
biotechnology. They don’t have a problem with it although </P>
<P>15 percent might. Agriculture is not far behind that. If you ask the question 
in the right way, in a non-prejudicial way, about 70 percent, 75 percent, 80 
percent of people say, I don’t have a problem with agricultural biotech to say 
reduce pesticides.</P><BR style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear=all>
<P>You start getting into animals and the approval goes (whistling sound). We 
have unresolved ethical issues with humane treatment of animals and what is, you 
know, we have dominion over them. Does that mean we can do anything we want to 
them? And we need to have this discussion as a society before people will buy 
into animal agriculture.</P>
<P><B>Dr. McHughen</B></P>
<P>It’s one of the points of confusion. As Bruce said, I didn’t have a chance to 
put up this slide. Basically, what it showed was the red biotech, medical 
biotech, which is largely supported by the populace, you know, the media 
coverage of the development of insulin, of betaseron, of dornase alpha and on 
and on is very positive in the public mind. But genetically modified corn or 
soybeans is largely negative.</P>
<P>But then if you ask people, well, would you support a biotech crop that was 
produced or allows farmers to use less pesticide, a huge approval rating. But if 
you ask the same people, what do you think of taking a gene from a human and 
putting it into a bacteria to get the bacteria to produce a human protein, no 
way. They don’t like that at all. But obviously that’s what insulin in. And the 
genetically modified corn and soybean is what the products are that allow 
farmers to use less pesticides. So there’s confusion there.</P>
<P><B>Dr. Davis</B></P>
<P>Obviously this is a fascinating topic and it’s too bad that we don’t have a 
few more hours to discuss it. But let me thank this outstanding panel for their 
presentations. Thank all of you for coming. Thank our sponsor for supporting 
this session. We will again have some opportunity for informal discussion up 
front. Thank you. [applause]</P>
