    But for at least two NASA researchers, it's not the visual fireworks
    that might make August 11 memorable, instead, it's the prospect
    of probing a 50 year old mystery. David Noever and Ron Koczor
    of the Marshall Space Flight Center have recently been tasked
    with checking some hard-to-believe measurements reported 50 years
    ago by Nobel laureate Maurice Allais. <BR>

    </TABLE>In 1959, at the enthusiastic urging of rocket pioneer
    Werner von Braun, a peculiar set of physics experiments first
    appeared in English as a four-part series in the journal <I>Aero/Space
    Engineering</I>. The author, Maurice Allais, was a skilled physicist
    with an interest in the behavior of <A HREF="#pendulum">Foucault's
    Pendulum</A>. From 1954 to 1960 he made careful observations
    of the motion of glass and metallic pendulums with the hope he
    would discover some connection between gravity and magnetism.
    Despite years of careful work, he never succeeded in finding
    a link between those disparate forces, but he did observe something
    extraordinary. During the total eclipses of June 30, 1954, and
    October 22, 1959, he detected &quot;anomalies in the movement
    of the ... pendulum&quot; during the time when the Earth, the
    Moon, and the Sun were aligned.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><I>&quot;A remarkable disturbance has been observed at the
      time of the total solar eclipse--June 30, 1954. ..[which] cannot
      be considered as due to the disturbances of an aleatory order
      [chance]. &quot;Neither can it be considered as produced by an
      indirect influence of known factors (temperature, pressure, magnetism,
      etc.). Finally, it cannot be identified with periodic lunisolar
      effects resulting from the actual theory of gravitation.&quot;

    <P>When Allais won the Nobel Prize in 1988 he revisited his experiments

    unsettling measurements have received little credence, despite
    the fact that he is a Nobel laureate. That may be because his
    1988 Nobel prize is in economics, not physics! Nevertheless,
    he was well-known to be a skilled physicist. For his careful
    experiments in gravitation he won the 1959 Galabert Prize of

    Allais&#146; solar eclipse results are hard to understand, but
    he was undoubtedly a meticulous scientist. His experiments were
    well-conceived and he repeated his measurements during two solar

    <!--/NOEDIT-->&quot;If something strange is happening to Foucault
    pendulums during solar eclipses, then it's a real mystery,&quot;
    says Noever. &quot;Is it some gravitational effect, a peculiar
    manifestation of tides, or something else entirely? The idea
    that some unexplained aspect of gravity is at work seems nonsensical
    when you consider that it would seem to imply planets spinning
    out of their orbits over very long time scales (among other things).
    Also, why would the effect show up only during a solar eclipse?
    The Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are nearly aligned about once
    a month near the time of the new moon. A solar eclipse takes
    place when they are <I>precisely</I> aligned. If something is
    happening to gravity once a month, wouldn't we have noticed by
    now?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;The bottom line,&quot; said Noever, &quot;is this: It's
    unlikely, but Allais could have stumbled on to something important.
    So, rather than debate a set of 50 year old measurements we're
    going to roll up our sleeves and try to detect Allais&#146; signal
    directly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

    team plans to observe the August 11, 1999, solar eclipse in an
    unusual way, with a high precision gravitometer located at the
    Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL. The gravitometer
    is a state-of-the-art gravity sensor tested as part of a Marshall
    project entitled &quot;Ultra-high precision gravity measurements&quot;.
    Noever and Koczor are using this extraordinary device to carry
    out sensitive experiments in gravity physics at the Marshall
    Space Flight Center. They are also exploring the history of peer-reviewed
    gravity research and repeating or recasting experiments that
    would benefit from the high precision afforded by the gravitometer.
    Allais&#146; work falls in this group. <BR>

    with magnetic, thermal and pressure shielding. The instrument
    reports very small changes in the gravitational force acting
    on a mechanical spring-mass. Gravitational changes are expressed
    as the electrical force (measured as voltage) required to maintain
    the spring-mass system at a predetermined position (the null
    point). The modified LaCoste-Romberg gravitometer (Edcon, Inc.
    Denver, CO) measures relative gravity until calibrated against
    a reference. The instrument is routinely calibrated along the
    10-station Rocky Mountain Calibration range established by NOAA,
    Edcon and the Colorado School of Mines. The calibration is validated
    by comparing the measure of absolute gravity in Huntsville Alabama
    with reference values from the USAF gravity disk.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
    &quot;If Allais&#146; disturbance is real, and if it has something
    to do with gravity, then we will be able to measure it to 10
    significant digits,&quot; says Noever. <BR>
<BR>
    Routinely, Noever and Koczor have recorded the gravitational
    disturbance of relatively small masses moving in a terrestrial
    laboratory--akin to a variation of one part in a billion in the
    local gravity field in response to the movements of a nearby
    automobile. These sensitivities in mass detection are traditionally
    considered appropriate subjects only for studying the kinds of
    enormous mass flows found in stars, not the subject for thoughtful
    laboratory research. If Allais&#146; pendulum experiments prove
    correct, then the Marshall experiments may reveal a disturbance
    as high as one-thousand on their measurement scale for the instrument--a
    relative siren amidst the otherwise quiet background of solar
    and lunar influence on Earth. <BR>

    major Foucault pendulums at the Hall of Justice in Brussels,

<BR>
    Since its accidental discovery prior to the 1851 World&#146;s
    Fair, the Foucault pendulum has become recognized as the first
    wholly non-astronomical demonstration of the Earth&#146;s rotation.
    In brief, when a mass on a wire is set in motion over the course
    of hours, its azimuthal direction will rotate with the Earth&#146;s
    axial spin. An especially clear demonstration would arrange a
    rim of sand or pegs along the periphery of the pendulum&#146;s
    maximum swing--a sort of sand fortress surrounded by a moat of
    semi-permanent wooden soldiers. As the day progresses, each soldier
    gets knocked down in the path of one circular turn of the pendulum.
    Either at the North or South pole particularly, each mark on
    the full circumference would have been visited exactly once per
    day--a phenomenon called the Foucault effect. Amazingly, from
    a closed room with no outside view of any time passage, it is
    possible to observe the Earth&#146;s rotation using this classical
    demonstration of the pendulum&#146;s inertial interplay with
    the Earth&#146;s rotation and gravity. Relative to the stars,
    the floor under the pendulum turns. <BR>

    web site maintained by the Physics Department at the University
    of Guelph. It includes a historical and tutorial discussion of
    Foucault's pendulum and a review of some anomalies in pendulum
    motion measured at the University of Guelph.</FONT></CENTER></P>

     SIZE="-1" FACE="arial,helvetica"> Starting the Foucault Pendulum
    in the building of the National Academy of Sciences and the National
    Research Council at Washington; this instrument demonstrates
    the rotation of the earth. (adapted from Science News and Letters,
    October 8, 1927 issue; Timeline Archives). In addition to showing
    the cumulative effects of what was then thought to be unmeasureably
    small Coriolis forces, Foucault&#146;s experiments defined for
    the first time a terrestrial reference frame relative to the
    stars and thus strongly influenced the genesis of two landmark
    findings in physics-- Mach&#146;s principle and Einstein&#146;s
    general relativity. Whatever corrections that Allais may have
    observed, these cannot result from any direct consequence of
    general relativity--the effects of which would be an astonishingly
    small contribution to any pendulum acted on by lunar or solar
    action (100 million times too small for any influence on Allais&#146;
    observations).</FONT></TD>
