<h3>How Do Computers Store Variables?</h3>

<p>
In any programming language, and especially in C++, it's important
to have at least a cursory understanding of what the computer
is doing "behind the scenes".  Since we're talking about
variables in this chapter, it's important to understand
how a computer stores the information in variables.
</p>


<h3>More Variable Types</h3>

<p>
For reasons not explained here, variables can only store finite
numbers.  Suppose that the size of a particular data type, that we'll
call a <i>gorb</i>, is 1 <a href="glossary.htm#byte">byte</a>.  That
means that gorbs can only represent 2<sup>8*1</sup> = 2<sup>8</sup> =
256 distinct values.  So, gorbs might be able to store only the
numbers between 0 and 255 (inclusive).  Any number that you tried to
store in a gorb which was smaller than 0, or larger than 255, would
not be stored correctly; it would be stored as one of the values
between 0 and 255.  However, maybe you want to be able to store
positive and negative numbers in gorbs, in which case you'd only
be able to store 128 negative numbers and 128 positive numbers.
Since we need to be able to store 0 also, you might decide that
the range of values for a gorb is -128 to 127.
</p>


<p>
We've already learned about two different data types (not 
including "gorbs"!): <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>.
What are the sizes of these data types, and what are the limits
on the kinds of values that they can store?  We just saw that
a data type whose size is 1 byte can store 256 distinct values.
Data types of size 2 bytes can store 2<sup>8*2</sup> = 2<sup>16</sup>
= 65536 different values.  Using the same formula, we determine that
data types of size 4 bytes can store 2<sup>8*4</sup> = 2<sup>32</sup>
= 4,294,967,296.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the size of data types like <code>int</code> and
<code>float</code> are not standard across all systems.  The
size of an <code>int</code> depends on your operating system
and your hardware.  Here are some typical values for <code>int</code>s
and <code>float</code>s, along with some other important data types.

<h3>When to Cast</h3>



<p>
<a href="glossary.htm#casting">Casting</a> a variable is a complicated
name for a simple concept.  When you cast a variable from one type to
another, all you are doing is telling the computer to use a different
type to store the variable.  Why would you need (or want) to do this?
Let's say you declared a variable of type <code>short</code>.  In most
cases, that would mean that the largest positive value you could store
would be 32,767.  But somewhere in your program, you realize that
you're going to have to do a calculation which could increase the
value over this maximum.  Perhaps you are computing very large
Pythagorean triplets.  To calculate the value of <i>c</i> (the
hypotenuse), you need to take the square root of the quantity
a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>.  But what if <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> is
very large?  Then squaring that number will make it much, much larger
-- and if the value becomes bigger than 32,767 your values will not be
what you expected (if you had used a <code>short</code> to store
<i>a</i> or <i>b</i>.  Remember, a <code>short</code> can only store
the values between -32,768 and +32,767, so if you try to store a
number out of this range, your data will be incorrect!


</p>

<p>
So, the solution is to cast.  We can <i>cast</i> the numbers to a
larger data type, such as an <code>int</code> or a <code>long</code>,
for the purposes of the calculation -- and then we can <i>cast</i>
them back to a <code>short</code> when we are done, since the final
value for <i>c</i> will probably be small enough to be stored in a
<code>short</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is a somewhat trivial example, since in this case you could store
the numbers in <code>int</code>s or <code>long</code>s from the
beginning and not worry about it!  A more useful example might be if
you have a number which represents an average.  You'll probably
want to represent the number with a floating-point type like
a <code>float</code> or a <code>double</code> so that it is
accurate while you are computing it (otherwise you'd only be able
to store a value like "26" instead of "26.3141885").  Let's say that
you want to display the value in a table, yet the table would look
cluttered if you displayed "26.3141885", so you decide to simply
display the integer portion, 26.  You can <i>cast</i> the 
<code>float</code> to an <code>int</code> and then display the
<code>int</code> in the table -- since <code>int</code>s can't
store floating-point numbers, the decimal portion of "26.3141885"
will be truncated and you will be left with "26".

</p>

<h3>How to Cast</h3>

<p>
Casting in C++ is easy.  Let's say that you have a <code>float</code>
storing a number like "26.3141885", and you want to have
an <code>int</code> storing the integer portion instead.  Here's
how to do it:

<pre>
int GetAverage() {

// assume that regularAverage and specialAverage store two floats
  float totalAverage = regularAverage + specialAverage;

// cast totalAverage to an int
  int truncatedAverage = (int) totalAverage;

// return the truncated value
  return truncatedAverage;
}
</pre>

There's a little bit of syntax that you haven't seen before, but
the key part to notice is the line of code that reads
<code>int truncatedAverage = (int) totalAverage</code>.  What
we're doing here is taking a <code>float</code>, <code>totalAverage</code>,
which stores some kind of decimal number (like 82.41832), and
getting rid of the ".41832" part by casting it to an <code>int</code>.
That works because the <code>int</code> is only capable of storing
integers, so it simply stores the integer portion of
<code>totalAverage</code>.
