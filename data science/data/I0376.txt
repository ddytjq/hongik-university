<H1>Interlink Express Midland Alliance</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1994</H2>
<P>The formation of the Midland Alliance rationalised the pyramid in the West
Midlands below the Southern League, then known as the Beazer Homes League. It
brought together leading clubs from the West Midlands (Regional) League and the
Midland Football Combination which until then fed directly into the Beazer Homes
League but thereafter became feeder leagues to the new competition. Selection of
the founder members was based mainly on ground facilities with each league
providing ten clubs. In 1996-97 the Leicestershire Senior League formally joined
the Pyramid as a feeder to the Midland Alliance although as yet there has been
no promotion to or from this league until clubs in that league can meet the
necessary ground grading.</P>
