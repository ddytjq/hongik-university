    <p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><strong>Repayment mortgage</strong></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">If you choose this method you make one payment to the Society
    each month. This payment is made up of capital and interest. Using this method you
    gradually pay off the amount borrowed plus the interest, until at the end of the mortgage
    term (usually a maximum of 25 years) you will have completely paid off the loan. Borrowers
    choosing the repayment method are strongly recommended to take out a term assurance policy
    so that in the event of death, the mortgage can be paid off. This is especially important
    for your dependant relatives.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><strong>Endowment mortgage</strong></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">If you choose this method, you make two payments each month -
    one to the Society and one to an assurance company. The payment you make to the Society is
    sufficient to cover the interest on the amount borrowed, whilst the payment to the
    assurance company is invested. The theory is that this investment should grow to such an
    extent that at the end of the mortgage term (again usually 25 years) there is sufficient
    to pay off your mortgage and possibly to provide you with a tax free lump sum. The policy
    automatically includes a level of life cover.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Conversely, if the endowment policy does not perform as well
    as expected, you may be left with a shortfall at the end of the mortgage term.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><strong>Pension mortgage</strong></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">This may be chosen by people who are either self-employed or
    in regular employment but not part of a company pension scheme. Once again you make two
    monthly payments - one to the lender to cover the interest charged on your mortgage and
    the other into a pension scheme administered by an assurance company. They invest your
    monthly contributions in a tax free fund and the aim is that at the end of the term (on
    this occasion the term may well be for more than 25 years) the investment has grown to
    such an extent that you can pay off your mortgage, and be provided with a pension on
    retirement.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Conversely, if the pension scheme does not perform as well as
    expected, you may be left with a shortfall at the end of the mortgage term. You must
    ensure the pension includes life cover or that you have alternative arrangements.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><strong>ISA Linked mortgage</strong></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">An ISA (Individual Savings Account) is a form of investment
    that enjoys tax benefits - growth is tax free. Once again you make two monthly payments -
    one to the Society to cover the interest charged on the amount borrowed, and the other
    (which may be an annual lump sum) into the ISA. If the ISA performs well you should be
    left with a surplus after the mortgage has been repaid or you may even be able to pay the
    loan off years in advance of the expected date. You must ensure the scheme includes life
    cover or that you have alternative arrangements.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Conversely, if the ISA does not perform as well as expected,
    you may be left with a shortfall at the end of the mortgage term.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><strong>Interest Only mortgage</strong></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">If you know that you are likely to be in the fortunate
    position of paying your mortgage off within a few years (perhaps you have an inheritance
    coming to you) you may wish to consider an Interest Only mortgage. With an Interest Only
    mortgage you make one monthly payment to the Society to cover the interest being charged
    and of course, as you are not repaying any of the capital you have borrowed, the balance
    you owe to the Society stays the same. If you choose this method the Society will require
    you to confirm in writing how you intend to repay the capital.</font></small></p>
