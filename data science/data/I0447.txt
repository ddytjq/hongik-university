The new season's here Joe. How do you see it going for West Ham this year?<br>
"I hope that West Ham-wise we can push up into the top ten, Just like we managed to do a few years ago, and get into contention. But first we have to really stabilise the club and then once everything is sorted out we can start building and looking towards the future. I can't really tell you how it's going to pan out until the season gets going. I wouldn't want to go making any predictions just yet."<p>

Is it strange for you being at West Ham without Harry Redknapp around?<br>
"Yeah, but you know, It was time for a change at the club anyway. Harry had been there for ten years and maybe it was time to bring some fresh ideas into the place, because there's a new crop of players, a good lot of youngsters to come in, and so maybe it is the right time for change. Jermain Defoe is still yet to come through, he played the last game of last season and there;s a lad called Shaun Byrne who I know they've got high hopes for. He's 20 or 21 and he really is an excellent player - he's got his head screwed on right. I'd personally rate him really highly."<p>

Were you worried that the family atmosphere might dissolve at the club?<br>
"Well, I think that's just the way the club is and I don't think it's something that Harry created all by himself, to be honest. That was around at West Ham a long time before Harry Redknapp and Frank Lampard. Harry did a great job at the club but maybe it's time to forget about that now and try and move on and progress. With Frank Jr. moving to Chelsea it was very dissapointing, but in football nowadays there are people coming and going all the time and you've just got to adjust and then bring someone else in who can fill Frank's role."<p>

With Frank missing from midfield it gives you more responsibility. Is that exciting?<br>
"Yeah of course, it's brilliant really. To be 19 and to be established in the Premiership with a big club and have an England cap to my name already, that's beyond my wildest dreams. I now want to push on from what I've got and become an England regular and produce the goods for West Ham."<p>

What did you make of Glenn Roeder's appointment as manager?<br>
"The fan's don't really know a lot about him but all I can say is he's probably the best coach I've worked under and he's got all sorts of ideas about how to do things, which is very exciting. In that way he's a bit like Sven Goran Eriksson, almost an english version of Sven. All the lads at West Ham really like him, so he's got that going for him. You get on with it whoever you're playing under but it's down to the board to pick the right man, and that's what their job is and I do think they've chosen the right man."<p>

Are you pleased with how your England career is going for you?<br>
"Yeah, I said at the start of last season that I wanted to make my England debut during the year and now I've got that to build on, so hopefully I can get a regular place and continue to progress with West Ham. Hopefully we'll go on to have a much better season."<p>

Did you think your debut went well?<br>
"I was nervous before the start of the game but I got into it and I found it's just the same as playing in the premier league. Getting all the new players to have a go against Mexico was great and I personally felt that I was much more involved. Obviously it was my debut as well so I'm never going to forget that, it will be with me forever. It was a magical day not just for me but for the whole team. It was a 4-0 win so you can't go wrong with that, you can't complain."<p>
You shone on the ledt of midfield in that game. Is that the role for you?<br>
"Well, centre midfield, left midfield, that's perfect for me. Left's probably better for me than right because I can cut in and go inside, so I'd like to play that left sided role. I finished last season playing for West Ham there. Paolo Di Canio and I were swapping sides and it felt comfortable. I think I put in a few good performances, and I enjoyed it."<p>

Have you thought about the Germany game in September yet?<br>
"I just hope that, as a supporter, we can beat them, but as a player I hope that I can get involved in some way. It's all down to me - what I do and how I play in the games leading up to it. I'll have played in a few games in the league before it comes around so you never know what's going to happen."<p><!-- text below generated by server.
