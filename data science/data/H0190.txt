					<h3>11 - 20 von 181</h3><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4002">Switzerland: SWTR Demands Offensive to Promote Research</a></strong><br />The Swiss Science and Technology Council (SWTR) recommends "A Nine-Point Program to Promote Science and Technology in Switzerland". The SWTR is an advi-sory organ of the Federal Council for all questions regarding science and technology. It consists of 13 members representing scientific life in Switzerland.
 <strong>2002-06-11</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3993">EU-Parliament Strikes Out Most of the Conditions Restricting Embryonal Research</a></strong><br />In the future, research with human stem cells and embryos can be supported with EU funds without strict conditions.
 <strong>2002-06-03</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3992">Online-Library Started for Natural Sciences and Technology</a></strong><br />With the new digital library GetInfo, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research has established quick access to scientific information from all areas of the natural sciences and technology.
 <strong>2002-06-03</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3983">EU Stem Cell Research: German-Speaking Countries and Great Britain as Extremes </a></strong><br />A new report published by Europa-Studien outlines the attitudes and legislati-on in each EU Member State to stem cell research, revealing that Germany and Austria have the most restrictive legislation, while the UK takes the most libe-ral approach. The report highlights the difficulty of the EU Member States in finding a common position on stem cell research. 2002-05-22
 <strong>2002-05-27</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3982">Switzerland: Embryonal Research Law (ERL): Consultation Opened 22 May 2002 </a></strong><br />The ERL should fill the legal gaps that currently exist in the area of embryonic research. Regulations are particularly needed for the handling of surplus em-bryos from in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and to answer the question of whether Switzerland will in the future be allowed to use surplus embryos to obtain em-bryonal stem cells. In the production of embryonal stem cells, embryos that are approximately 4 days old are destroyed. The new law should also regulate whether Switzerland will permit the import of embryonal stem cells. According to current regulations, the domestic production of embryonal stem cells is for-bidden, because embryos have to be destroyed. It is, however, not forbidden to import embryonal stem cells, because stem cells do not fall under embryo protection. 2002-05-22
 <strong>2002-05-27</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3981">Ten Popular Myths about Green Gene Technology </a></strong><br />The Academy for Technological Impact Assessment (TA Academy) in Baden-Württemberg completed a study on behalf of the EU on the attitudes toward and acceptance of green gene technology (genetically modified food pro-ducts). Results: most of the perceptions of politicians and economics repre-sentatives regarding public attitudes toward green gene technology are wrong. Interestingly, results of parallel studies carried out in Italy, France, Spain and Great Britain are very similar. The public majority does not refuse genetically modified foods per se. Most of the resistance is against the communication style of the authorities and industry. Citizens do not feel well informed and find fault in the fact that they are not included in decision-making processes.

 <strong>2002-05-27</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3976">Europe: Stem Cells: European Group on Ethics (EGE) Recommends Patenting of Modified Human Stem Cells</a></strong><br />The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) presented its opinion to the President of the European Commission, Roman Prodi, on 7 May 2002. The EGE is in favor of patenting human stem cells, as long as they have been modified. Only under the conditions of such modifications can one speak of an invention, which is patentable, but not applicable to stem cells, which can "only" be isolated and cultured. Unmodified stem cells are merely discoveries of natural biological material, which do not fulfil the legal requirements for patentability in Switzerland. 
 <strong>2002-05-22</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3975">Genes to Detect Environmental Toxins in Minute Concentrations</a></strong><br />Several toxins &#8211; for example medications, biocides and other chemicals &#8211; can be found in soil as well as in water. Since, however, they are often present in relatively low concentrations, the biological effects of these compounds are difficult or even impossible to prove with classical ecological-toxicological biotests, such as mortality or reproductive tests. Nonetheless, there are a number of compounds thought to have a damaging effect on animals and humans. Biologists want to use the genes of the threadworm (Nematode) "Caenorhabditis elegans" to detect environmental toxins. <strong>2002-05-22</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3974">Gene Therapy: Alternative Methods to Avoid using Retroviruses as Vectors: Super Small Fat Particles</a></strong><br />According to a press report in the "New Scientist", a research group at the Case Western University School of Medicine has successfully produced small liposomal particles (fat particles) that can pass through the pores of nuclear membranes. Normal liposomes have a diameter of 100nm and are too large to make their way into the genome in the cell nucleus. This new method allows DNA to be packaged into particles with a diameter of only 25nm, thus small enough to pass through nuclear pores.
 <strong>2002-05-22</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3977">Switzerland/Germany: Swiss Exhibition "Gene World Nutrition"</a></strong><br />The "Gene World Nutrition" exhibition can be found until 7 June 2002 at the public library in Heidelberg. It was designed by "Alimentarium", the Swiss Museum for Nutrition. "Alimentarium" is a Nestle foundation. The exhibition presents biotechnology and provides information on its possible contributions for the environment. Visitors can form their opinions on the complex topic of "Green Gene Technology".
