Fullers Pub) on the corner of Brook Road and Braemar Rd (close to the away
end). Also popular with away fans is the New Inn (corner of New Road and
Ealing Rd) although all the pubs around the ground seem to allow well
behaved away fans in.  We have received information on the four pubs from
several sources and The Griffin, The New Inn and The Princess Royal have
been have all been suggested as the pub for away fans from different
people.
