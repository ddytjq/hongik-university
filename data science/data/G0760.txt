      know they were about to do it, but eight years ago scientists
      led by a team of astronomers in Huntsville, Ala., were on the
      verge of discovering the incredible. What appeared to be local
      firecrackers in the sky, were instead distant megablasts, each
      releasing more energy in ten seconds than the Sun emits in its
      entire 10-billion-year lifetime. It was the last thing they expected
      to find from these accidentally-discovered cosmic enigmas.</P>

      <P>The stage was set when the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was
      launched by the Space Shuttle <I>Atlantis</I> (STS-37) on April
      5, 1991. The crew deployed it on April 8 (after helping unstick
      an antenna). A few days later, the spacecraft started observing
      the universe with a sensitivity never before achieved.</P>

      </TABLE>Slowly, as the data began to come in, the science team
      working on one of the instruments noticed that something was
      unusual - things did not look as they had expected. At first
      they rechecked their instrument - the Burst and Transient Source
      Experiment (<A HREF="http://www.batse.com/">BATSE</A>) - to make
      sure that some glitch wasn't giving an incorrect view of the
      universe. After just 30 bursts, BATSE was telling the scientists
      that the sources of mysterious gamma-ray bursts were randomly
      scattered across the sky and thus probably lay far outside our
      Galaxy.</P>

      </TABLE><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A puzzle from the Cold War</FONT></B><BR>
      Since the late 1960s when they were discovered by satellites
      watching for violations of a nuclear test ban treaty, gamma-ray
      bursts have puzzled scientists. Detectors on the monitoring satellites,
      and later aboard interplanetary spacecraft could not resolve
      the puzzle. (Three sources were located and later identified
      as Soft Gamma Repeaters, and are now believed to be magnetars,
      a totally different kind of object than a 'classical' gamma-ray
      burst. But most of the bursts had higher energies and no known
      location.)</P>

      <P>When NASA started planning the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory,
      Fishman proposed including BATSE as a burst alarm. It would quickly
      tell where a burst was located so the three larger instruments
      could pin them down and solve the mystery. [see box]</P>

      <P>Fishman, Meegan, a co-investigator at NASA/Marshall, and other
      scientists expected that BATSE would show most of the bursts
      were clustered along the Milky Way, the bright band across the
      heavens where most of our galaxy's stars are located.</P>

      <P>Instead, the bursts were scattered across the sky</P>

      <P>&quot;This was inconsistent with any known distribution of
      objects in our galaxy,&quot; Fishman said. &quot;That immediately
      caused a significant fraction of the scientific community to
      rethink the galactic neutron star model of bursts, and start
      thinking about cosmological models.&quot;</P>

      <P>Fishman described presenting his finding in October 1991 to
      a GRO science meeting: it was total silence &quot;followed by
      a series of rapid-fire questions. It was an electrifying experience.
      Once in a lifetime.&quot;</P>

      <P>But the change wasn't universal.</P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Bursting with energy</FONT></B><BR>
      &quot;We took a lot of heat from people trying to blame flaws
      in BASTE,&quot; Meegan said. &quot;We were like the first wave
      hitting the beach, and everyone took shots at us.&quot; But the
      rigorous control held over BATSE during assembly and testing
      gave scientists the assurance that they were indeed getting a
      new view of the universe.</P>

      <P>Fishman admits getting a slight knot in his stomach, and not
      just because he was about to upset a cherished theory.</P>

      <P>&quot;All that summer I got a queasy feeling because I realized
      the significance of what we were finding,&quot; he continued.
      &quot;It actually scared me somewhat because I realized these
      are the largest known explosions in the universe.&quot; The implication
      was that they were incredibly distant and therefore incredibly
      bright.</P>

      <P>Since then, scientists have continued to debate possible sources,
      and BATSE continued recording about 8 new bursts every 10 days.
      In late 1997, it reached No. 2,000. Last week, the count was
      near 2,400. Almost four times as many bursts have actually happened
      in that time, since the Earth blocks almost half the sky from
      BATSE, and other factors cut in half the number of bursts that
      BATSE can detect.</P>

      <P>It was one of those &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; bursts that
      helped nail down the distance to bursts. On Jan. 23, 1997, Italy's
      Beppo SAX X-ray astronomy satellite was pointed in the right
      place at the right time. Ironically, CGRO was just 5 minutes
      below the horizon and missed the show. But a scientist affiliated
      with the BATSE team was able to use time on an optical telescope
      to use Beppo SAX data and pin the burst to a distant galaxy that
      then was studied by the Hubble Space Telescope.</P>

      <P>Chance is less of a factor now with the addition in 1997 of
      the University of Michigan's Robotic Optical Transient Source
      Experiment (ROTSE) that takes a cue from BATSE and quickly points
      an array of four cameras in the right area. On. Jan. 23, 1999,
      it captured the first optical images of a burst &quot;in the
      act&quot; just 20 seconds after BATSE was triggered, and while
      the burst was still emitting gamma-rays.</P>

      <P>Yet even with this wealth of data, scientists still aren't
      sure what causes the bursts. Initially, they thought that the
      bursts were caused by two neutron stars orbiting each other and
      eventually colliding, or a neutron star being swallowed by a
      black hole. Little else could account for a blast that emits
      more energy in a few seconds that our sun will emit in its entire
      lifetime.</P>

      <P>None of the theories solved all of the problems, including
      going directly to gamma-ray emissions. Now scientists are studying
      the hypernova model. This involves a star about 50 times as massive
      as our sun reaching the end of life. It has burned everything
      its core, implodes and then explodes. It seems to be the only
      way of producing a fireball whose shock front moves near the
      speed of light and generates the immense quantities of energy
      required.</P>

      <P>It would also appear to be something common in the early universe,
      but far less likely in older, closer galaxies. Gamma-ray bursts
      could be closely linked to our own lives since the dust that
      became planets was forged in the hearths of explosions like supernovas
      and hypernovas.

      BATSE has also been applied to studying less powerful - yet incredibly
      interesting - events as well. Its name also says &quot;transient,&quot;
      meaning objects that come and go.</P>

      <P>&quot;BATSE has done a lot more than bursts,&quot; Meegan
      said. &quot;It has observed pulsars and other objects by Earth
      occultation. We weren't sure that was going to work.&quot; This
      approach makes the Earth a part of the instrument as the satellite's
      orbit makes sources rise and set.</P>

      <P>The trick was in the math that could sift through a sky simmering
      and occasionally bursting in gamma rays so that any chosen point
      source could be studied.</P>

      <P>&quot;In theory it was possible, but we weren't sure if it
      was practical,&quot; Meegan said. &quot;and lo and behold, some
      folks here - notably Dr. Nan Zhang (a National Research Council
      fellow) - were able to do it with large section of the sky using
      a derivative of a medical imaging program.&quot;</P>

      <P>The technique is a little like sitting inside a room with
      frosted glass walls and studying a flashing light just based
      on rapid changes in brightness and comparing the brightness of
      the different windows.</P>

      <P>&quot;That amazes people,&quot; Fishman said, &quot;how we
      can home in on independent sources across the sky. We've been
      extremely successful in observing more than 50 individual objects.&quot;

            scales has been settled in favor of the latter. Redshifts up

      <P>In addition, of the top 20 authors cited most often for 1996
      in Astrophysical Journal <I>Letters</I>, four are from the BATSE
      team: Fishman, Meegan, Dr. Alan Harmon of NASA and Dr. Chryssa
      Kouveliotou of the Universities Space Research Association.</P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Bursts yet to come</FONT></B><BR>
      So where next?</P>

      <P>&quot;Even though the emphasis is on locating and studying
      optical and X-ray counterparts,&quot; Fishman said, &quot;BATSE
      is still the most sensitive instrument for measuring gamma-ray
      bursts for the next five years. Even after the launch of the
      SWIFT satellite, it still will be the most sensitive at the higher
      energy levels.&quot;</P>

      <P>Depending on solar activity which can expand the outer atmosphere
      and accelerate a satellite's return to Earth, BATSE and the other
      GRO instruments should operate until 2006 and perhaps as long
      as 2009.</P>

      <P>That's time enough for another 2,100 to 3,000 bursts. Who
      knows what surprises are in store?</P>

      <P>&quot;The universe turned out to be a lot more interesting
      in terms of what we were trying to do,&quot; Meegan said of the
      burst discovery.</P>

      <P>It may do it yet again.
