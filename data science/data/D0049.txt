<ul>
  <li><a href="benchmarks.html">Microbenchmark</a> results for SuperCede's new
      just-in-time compiler show that it's a clear winner in several
      categories (e.g. creating objects, manipulating bytes), although not all.
  <li>Sun is promising to release
      <!-- href="http://www.sun.com/sunsoft/Products/Developer-products/java/jit/index.html" -->
      their own JITC soon.  They've released
      <!-- href="http://www.sun.com/sunsoft/Products/Developer-products/java/jit/performance.html" -->
      microbenchmark results for a beta version.
  <li>More interestingly, Sun are putting together a

      href="linpack.html">Linpack</a> results for Symantec's new just-in-time
      compiler in Visual Caf&eacute; PR 2 suggest that Netscape was wise to
      pick it for their future implementations -- it challenges Microsoft and
      is clearly superior to the Borland JITC currently used in Navigator 3.0.

  <li>It can pay to inline your own primitives: <tt>Math.abs(x)</tt> is
