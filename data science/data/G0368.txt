The Universe sends us light at all wavelengths of the 
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html">
electromagnetic spectrum</a>.  However, most of this light does not 
reach us at ground
level here on Earth.  Why?  Because we have an atmosphere which 
blocks out many types of radiation while letting other types through.
Fortunately for life on Earth, our atmosphere blocks out harmful
high energy radiation like X-rays, gamma rays and most of the 
ultraviolet rays.  It also block out most infrared radiation as
well as very low energy radio waves.  On the other hand,
our atmosphere lets visible light, most radio waves, and
small wavelength ranges of infrared light through, allowing 
astronomers to view the Universe at these wavelengths.
<p>
Most of the infrared light coming to us from the Universe is absorbed by
water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere.  Only in a
few narrow wavelength ranges, can infrared light make it through
(at least partially) to a ground based infrared telescope.

<p>
The Earth's atmosphere causes another problem for infrared astronomers.
The atmosphere itself radiates strongly in the infrared, often putting
out more infrared light than the object in space being observed.  This
atmospheric infrared emission peaks at a wavelength of about 10 microns
(micron is short for a micrometer or one millionth of a meter).
<p>
So the best view of the infrared universe from ground based telescopes
are at infrared wavelengths which can pass through the Earth's 
atmosphere and at which the atmosphere is dim in the infrared.
Ground based infrared observatories are usually placed near the
summit of high, dry
mountains to get above as much of the atmosphere as possible.
Even so, most infrared wavelengths are completely absorbed by the
atmosphere and never make it to the ground.
<p>
From the table below, you can see that only a few of the infrared
"windows" have both high sky transparency and low sky emission.
These infrared windows are mainly at infrared wavelengths below
4 microns.

Basically, everything we have learned about the Universe comes
from studying the light or electromagnetic radiation emitted
by objects in space.
To get a complete picture of the Universe, we need to see it in
all of its light, at all wavelengths.  This is why it is so important
to send observatories into space, to get above our atmosphere 
which prevents so much of this valuable information from reaching us.
<p>
Since most infrared light is blocked by our atmosphere, infrared 
astronomers have placed instruments onboard, rockets, balloons,
aircraft and space telescopes to view regions of the infrared which
are not detectable from the ground.  As a result, amazing 
discoveries about our Universe have been made and hundreds of
thousands of new astronomical sources have been detected for 
the first time.  
<p>
Due to the rapid development of better infrared detectors and the
ability to place telescopes in space, the
future is extremely bright for infrared astronomy.

discoveries being made in infrared astronomy as we now
can see beyond our atmosphere's infrared windows!
