  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>PLEASE TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO READ THESE NOTES WHICH 
        ARE FOR YOUR GUIDANCE</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Your Duty of Disclosure </b>
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">We cannot stress too strongly the importance of full disclosure when 
        proposing for, or renewing, any insurance policy. Even an innocent 
        omission of a single speeding offence a few years ago could result in 
        insurers refusing to pay a claim if they would not have accepted the 
        risk in full knowledge.<b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Quotations</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Our quotations are guaranteed based on the information provided at 
        the date given. We reserve the right to withdraw quotations before they 
        are taken up, and to apply any changes notified to us by underwriters 
        after the quotation was given.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Law to be applied</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>The parties are free to choose the law applicable to a contract of 
        insurance. Unless specifically agreed to the contrary all contracts 
        arranged through our Agency are subject to the Law of England and Wales.
        </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Complaints Procedure</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It is always our intention, and that of your insurers, to provide the 
        best possible standard of service. If you have a complaint which is not 
        handled to your satisfaction, please write to our Customer Care Manager.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Should the matter still not be resolved to your satisfaction further 
        procedures will be advised.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Cancellation</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Practices vary between insurers, but be aware that cancellation 
        refunds are not given after a claim, and otherwise calculated on a short 
        period scale weighted in favour of the insurer as their costs are 
        similar whether a policy has run for one month or twelve. We do not 
        refund commission, since this was earned for arranging the policy 
        (unless you are replacing the policy through our Agency). Instalment 
        charges are not refunded.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Our charges</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>In order to cover the costs incurred, we charge £20 each time a 
        cheque is unpaid. If you know you will not have funds to meet a cheque, 
        just call us and we will be pleased to delay presentation to assist.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Please take care of your Certificate of Insurance. It is a legal 
        document and duplicates incur a charge of £15.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>We charge for payment by instalments - please refer to your 
        payment options.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>We make a charge of £14 in respect of adjustments to your policy, 
        and do not refund commission.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Account settlement</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Accounts are payable immediately, and a charge of £5 is added to 
        any reminders after the first.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Year 2000 and other Date Recognition</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>No doubt you have heard of the problems that may be caused due to 
        equipment and electrical items being unable to recognise certain dates, 
        which may result in failure or breakdown.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Insurance policies have never been intended to cover items that 
        simply breakdown or fail to work and failure to handle a date correctly 
        is an example. An endorsement clarifying that failed items are not 
        covered is included in your Policy or Schedule. Please check the 
        endorsement carefully and refer back to us if you do not understand it.</b></font></p>
