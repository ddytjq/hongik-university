Answer: <P> 
<menu>Colleges and universities, non-profit organizations, for-profit commercial organizations,
foreign organizations, state and local governments, and unaffiliated individuals may submit grant
applications in response to the grant solicitation notices.  DOE National Laboratories and other
Federal agencies are not allowed to respond directly to the grant solicitation notices.  DOE
National Laboratories may submit task proposals for funding under their current DOE contract;
and may wish to respond to the program announcements listed under Program Announcements to
National Laboratories.  Other Federal agencies may submit unsolicited proposals for funding via
interagency agreements. Guidelines, proposal forms, and both grant and lab announcements are
available on <A
HREF="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/grants/grants.html">Grants and Contracts Web
Site.</A></menu><P>

<li><A NAME="rims">What is the Research Information Management System and how does one use it to submit data electronically?</A><P>
Answer:<P>
<ul>

OBER's Research Information Management System (RIMS) is a web and local area network-based database that will be used to collect, store, and retrieve information on all OBER research projects.  RIMS was developed for use by headquarters staff and principal investigators to minimize duplicate data entry and to streamline the exchange of critical information on all research funded and managed by OBER.  It is designed to collect data directly from principal investigators through its web interface in a common format.  
Every principal investigator (PI) will be assigned a user ID and password, giving them access to the <A HREF="http://www.sc.doe.gov/rims/scripts/rims.exe">web interface</A> that contains only their projects.  RIMS will notify investigators automatically by email when information like progress is needed, reducing the likelihood of funding delays.  PIs will enter project abstracts, progress reports for continuations and renewals, information on collaborations, and project contact information directly into RIMS ensuring that all project information available to headquarters staff is accurate and current.

<li><A NAME="gnm">Why is BER supporting Human Genome Research?</A><P> Answer:
<P>
<ul>After the atomic bomb was developed and used, the U.S. Congress charged DOE's
predecessor agencies (the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and
Development Administration) with studying and analyzing genome structure, replication,
damage, and repair and the consequences of genetic mutations, especially those caused by
radiation. From these studies grew the recognition that the best way to study these effects was to
analyze the entire human genome to obtain a reference sequence. Planning began in 1986 for
DOE's <A HREF="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/ober/hug_top.html">Human Genome
Program</a> and in 1987 for NIH's program. The DOE-NIH U.S. Human
Genome Program formally began October 1, 1990, after the first joint 5-year plan was written
and a memorandum of understanding was signed between the two organizations. </ul><P>

<li><A NAME="gcr">Why is BER supporting Global Change Research?</A><P>   Answer:
<P>  
<ul>
BER is supporting Global Change Research because of the relationship between climate change
and emissions to the atmosphere from the development and use of energy technologies.  The
BER <A HREF="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/ober/ESD_top.html">global change
research program</a> focuses on understanding the basic chemical, physical, and
biological processes of the Earth's atmosphere, land, and oceans and how these processes may be
affected by energy production and use, primarily the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel
combustion.  These investigations are important elements in the overall DOE research program
to provide solutions to the nation's energy needs.<P>


DOE  has always been a significant player in global change research and, in fact, launched the
first federal research program exploring the links between the rise of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere and climate change in 1978.  DOE has continued to support research to better understand
and predict how the Earth's climate responds to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and what
the potential impacts of climate change would be.   <P>
</ul>

<li><A NAME="bior">Why is BER supporting Bioremediation Research?</A><P>   Answer:
<P> 
<ul>
DOE's Office of Environmental Management is responsible for the environmental management
of 130 sites and facilities that have been contaminated in places with pollutants from the production of
nuclear weapons.  OBER's basic research in bioremediation has the potential to be useful in the
remediation and restoration of the contaminated locations at these sites.  For example,
the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research (NABIR) program focuses on DOE problems.
The theme for the NABIR Program emphasizes field-scale research and metal and radionuclide 
contamination, specifically on the metals and radionuclides associated with weapons production.</ul><P>  

<li><A
NAME="hgprog">What progress is being made in the Department of Energy's Human Genome
Program</A><P> 

Answer: <P> 
<ul>
     <li>The program continues to develop resources and technologies that are in demand in the
broader research community, and there has been considerable progress towards several specific
goals.<P> 
     <li>In mapping projects, a new resource of readily sequenced DNA clones is serving in the
completion of some maps and will speed projects where fine structure mapping has been
slow.<P>

     <li>The chromosome microdissection project had a pivotal role in this year's discovery of the
colon cancer gene and is similarly aiding other disease gene hunts.<P>         

<li>The Sequencing by Hybridization DNA sequencing technology has been demonstrated to be
a powerful system for economical and massively parallel characterizations of the DNA clones
representing expressed genes.<P>

     <li>Three National Laboratories (BNL, LANL, and LLNL) have CRADAs for transfer of
novel DNA sequencing technologies, and robotic systems for DNA clone processing developed
at LBL are serving the commercial, as well as the non-profit, sector.<P>           <li>Experience is
being gained with three different pilot strategies for large-scale sequencing, to guide decisions
leading to a National capacity of 100 megabases(DNA subunits)/yr in 1996.<p>         <li>The
first of a new generation of capillary gel DNA sequencing systems allowing 10-fold speed
increases is entering commercial production, and replaceable gel matrix for such capillaries is
greatly increasing the utility of these systems.<P>        

 <li>Following an intensive review of services
needed for facile utilization of accumulating genome information, a program to establish
user-friendly linkages between the multiple databases needed to support genomics has
begun.<P>
    </ul>

<li><A NAME="elsi">What efforts is BER taking to address the ethical issues of its research
programs?</A><P>
Answer: <P> 
<ul>Two of the BER research programs, the Human Genome Program (HGP) and the Natural and Accelerated
Bioremediation Research (NABIR) Program, include activities (with budgets) specifically to explore and 
address the potential societal implications of these research areas.  For the HGP, this activity is known as 
"ELSI", for ethical, legal, and social implications; for NABIR, it is known as "BASIC", for bioremediation
and its societal implications and concerns.  The ELSI program of the HGP has existed for 11 years and has
sponsored workshops for judges and others, educational programs and curricula, public television and radio
documentaries, academic research into privacy concerns of genetic information, model legislation for privacy
protection, a museum display, and studies of genome patenting. One of the first activities in the NABIR program 
was a  <A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/NABIR/BASIC.homepage.html">workshop</A> on July 17-18, 1996, near
Warrenton, Virginia.  In all, 45 invited participants from government, academia, non-profit institutions, 
trade organizations, and the business community met to discuss the ethical, legal, and social issues associated
with the new NABIR program. The objectives of the workshop were (1) to explore what some of the societal, 
public policy, educational, and other issues attendant to the NABIR program might be; (2) to begin the 
process of public involvement; and (3) to develop an initial set of recommendations for creating a
program for Bioremediation and Its Societal Implications and Concerns (BASIC) within NABIR. Since 
that time, BASIC has supported activities in both the university sector and the DOE labs
(specifically PNNL and ORNL) to explore public perspectives on bioremediation research, 
and develop materials (the NABIR Primer) to communicate the science behind bioremediation research to the public.

<li><A NAME="hspol">Which office oversees human subjects protection at the Department of
Energy?</A><P> Answer:
<P>  
<ul>
The Office of Biological and Environmental Research (OBER) is responsible for the protection
of human subjects involved in research throughout the Department of Energy.  The Protecting
Human Subjects Program at DOE ensures that research involving human research subjects
comply with 10 CFR Part 745, <i>Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects</I>.
<P></ul>
<li><A NAME="userf">Does BER support user facilities?  If so, how can users submit
proposals to use these facilities?</A> <P>

<li><A NAME="bnct">What is the current status of clinical applications of Boron Neutron
Capture Therapy?</A><P> 
Answer<P>
<menu>
As of today 47 patients have been treated in the clinical trials.  Thirty-four of these were at
Brookhaven National Laboratory; all of these patients were treated for brain tumors.  Thirteen
patients were treated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Harvard: 8  patients with brain
tumors and 5 with skin melanomas. <P>
Results:<P>
There was no toxicity from componds and neutron exposure.  The life expectancy exceeds that of
conventional therapy.  Since the treatment time is dramatically less than conventional therapy (1
day compared to 2 months) the quality of life is also better.<P>  The trials are continuing.  A
workshop is planned for November to discuss the future of the therapy.<P>
