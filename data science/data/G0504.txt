<div class="mainheader">What's the Universe Made Of?</div>

<p><table align="right"><tr><td><img width="125" src="/images/voids.jpg" border="0" alt="Black Hole Simulation"></td></tr></table>The Big Bang is the best theory we have about the origin of the Universe, but this theory is far from complete.  For example, the Big Bang can account for the presence of light elements -- hydrogen, helium, and lithium.  But the theory cannot explain how the magnificent hierarchy of stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies formed from the fiery detritus of that initial spark.  The Big Bang, in fact, predicts that matter and radiation should be evenly distributed through the Universe.  Yet clearly the Universe has patches of galaxies and voids of seemingly empty space.</p>  

<p>How can we account for this?  It just may be that up to 95% of the Universe is made of matter and energy we cannot detect nor understand.  The unknown substance is beyond our comprehension right now -- much like the concept of X-rays were before the year 1890.  This mystery substance, perhaps in a variety of forms, dictates the structure and fate of the Universe.  There are two categories:  a "dark energy" that seems to act in opposition to gravity, repelling matter instead of attracting it; and "dark matter" that may truly be dark ordinary matter that doesn't shine like stars or perhaps a new category of exotic matter that modern instruments cannot detect.</p>

<p><a href="/docs/missions/missions.html" title="Cosmic Journeys missions">Cosmic Journeys missions</a> will measure the ratio of ordinary matter to dark matter and dark energy, map out regions of dark matter, and even attempt to directly measure certain forms of theorized dark matter.</p>

<p><a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="MAP">The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP)</a>, launched in June 2001, studies the afterglow of the Big Bang.  This light, from an era long before the first stars and galaxies, is a fossil remnant of all the forms of matter and energy in the early Universe.  MAP will scrutinize the temperature differences seen in this light today, which point back to density differences when the Universe was in its infancy.  The way these temperature differences are distributed -- in patches across the entire sky that vary only a millionth of a degree (temperature) from region to region separated by one or two angular degrees -- speaks directly of the ratio of dark matter and dark energy dictating density of ordinary matter from region to region.</p>

<p>The current estimate is that the Universe is 65% dark energy, 30% dark matter, and 5% ordinary matter -- the kind of stuff that stars, planets, and humans are made of.  MAP will hone this estimate.  Gravity wave missions such as the <a href="http://lisa.jpl.nasa.gov/" title="LISA">Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA)</a> may be able to detect the rumbling of the Big Bang, ripples in the fabric of space caused by that great explosion.  Because gravity waves do not interact with matter, those initial gravity waves produced by the Big Bang could still be percolating through the Universe for us to detect.  If so, LISA and follow-up missions could use these waves to determine the total mass content of the Universe -- for the frequency of the waves depend on the density of matter.</p>

<p>After the big bang and its afterglow, the Universe entered into the so-called "dark ages" when nothing shined.  Hydrogen gas had yet to collapse in great balls and form stars.  Structure takes time, as you can imagine.  The popular "cold dark matter" theory predicts that exotic dark matter (of a yet unknown and undetectable nature) and a little bit of normal matter clumped together to form long filaments, which were scattered across the Universe creating a web.  This was the very first structure.  The filaments were a result of millions of years of gravity carving out denser regions of space, leaving voids in its wake.  Hydrogen was the predominant gas along these filaments.  Hundreds of millions of years went by.  Pockets of hydrogen condensed, and galaxies started forming along the filaments like beads on a string.  Stars formed along with galaxies.  Where filaments intersected, galaxy clusters arose.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="Constellation-X">Constellation X-ray Observatory</a> will probe these regions of dark matter filaments by mapping the flow of gas between with galaxies.  The gas is very hot -- hot enough to glow in X-ray radiation -- and it is hot for a reason!  The gas is being pulled together, attracted by the gravitation force of unseen dark matter.  Dark matter must be there in great quantities.  Otherwise, the gas would dissipate.  No gravity, no clumping, not excitement.  By understanding the amount and distribution of gas between galaxies -- in gravitationally bound galaxy cluster systems -- scientists can piece together the amount and distribution of dark matter.</p> 

<p>But ah, what is dark matter?  There are, naturally, many theories... and they all may be both correct and incorrect.  That is, dark matter need not be one type of matter.  Dark matter could be a combination of dim chunks of ordinary matter plus many forms of exotic matter plus great abundances of miniscule bits of matter.  Scientists aren't fussy.  They are merely looking for the unseen mass providing the gravitational glue that keeps galaxies and galaxy clusters from flying apart -- for the amount of ordinary, visible matter does not provide enough mass to keep things in place.</p>

<p>One form of "cold" dark matter may be WIMPs, weakly interacting massive particles.  These would be located in galaxy halos and would provide the mass (i.e., gravitational potential) needed to keep all the stars in the galaxy from floating away.  The <a href="http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="GLAST">Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST)</a> may detect WIMPs if they exist.  Essentially, theory has it that if two WIMP particles collide, they will produce a gamma-ray photon at a very characteristic energy level.  If GLAST detects gamma rays in the Milky Way galaxy halo at this energy level, scientists will know they have detected WIMPs.  We can only see them when they collide, like the fire from a cosmic highway accident.</p>

<p>An example of "hot" dark matter is the neutrino, a particle that scientists have detected.  Neutrinos are similar to electrons, only they have zero charge and very little mass, so they are very hard to detect.  They can pass through miles of solid lead without so much as hitting an atom.  The Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector in Japan -- a tank of 50,000 tons of pure water deep below the earth -- has detected a few neutrinos interacting with the water molecules.  Yet, being so light, are neutrinos in great enough abundance to wield a noticeable gravitational effect on the Universe at large?  Cosmic Journeys aims to find out by supporting research with neutrino detectors and by developing models for neutrino creation and distribution.  The Big Bang produced copious amounts of neutrinos, and new neutrinos are generated with every star explosion.</p>  

<p>Scientists have many theories about dark matter because they have had many years to think about it.  Vera Rubin was one of the first astronomers to suggest that galaxies must contain a dark form of matter.  In mid-1960s, Rubin studied spiral galaxies hoping to learn why spirals varied in their shape and brightness.  Assuming this had something to do with how fast the galaxies spin, she set out to measure the rotation velocity of the outer disk.  (Rotational velocity of galaxy cores was already known.)  Rubin noticed that outer disks rotated as fast as the central region.  This didn't seem plausible, for the core -- with its brighter stars and greater mass -- should rotate around the galaxy center faster than the disk.  What Rubin had stumbled upon was evidence of dark matter, missing mass in the galactic halo providing the gravitational potential to keep the outer disk rotating fast and held together. She estimated that 90% of a galaxy's mass is dark matter.</p> 

<p>Since the 1960s, the race has been on to identify dark matter.  Dark energy, on the other had, is a newcomer.  The popular theory of dark energy was born in 1998 with the discovery that the most distant galaxies are moving away from us faster than we had thought.  Not only is the Universe expanding, the expansion is accelerating.  Gravity should be slowing down the expansion, scientists thought.  Now we have come to the conclusion that a mysterious energy is speeding up the expansion.</p>

<p>Gravity and dark energy might work back and forth in dictating the design of the Universe.  One force may be greater than the other overall during different epochs.  Dark energy seems to be "winning" today, sending the Universe off into an expansion frenzy.  The MAP satellite and Cosmic Journeys microwave missions to follow will probe the beginning of time, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when gravity and dark energy first emerged.  Other Cosmic Journeys missions will identify distant galaxies and star explosions to determine how the expansion rate of the Universe has changed over time.</p>

<p>One very new theory that borrows on a very old theme is that of quintessence.  Dark energy, the theory holds, is a substance called quintessence that has the ability to either attract or repel.  <a href="/docs/science/quintessence.html" title="Quintessence">An article about quintessence is here.</a></p>
