<p>Scientists have shown that beneficial <a href="http://www.ultranet.com/~jkimball/BiologyPages/M/Mutations.html">mutations</a>
do occur to produce brand new <a href="http://www.ultranet.com/~jkimball/BiologyPages/A/A.html#allele">alleles</a>
(variants of genes) that improve an organism's chances of survival in a
particular environment. <a href="http://www.ultranet.com/~jkimball/BiologyPages/E/Evolution.html#NaturalSelection">Natural
selection</a> has been demonstrated to increase the frequency of these
alleles in a population. The easiest way to demonstrate this is from experiments
based upon lines of organisms developed from clones (genetically identical
by definition) of a single individual. The following examples are from
pages 183 - 186 the book "Selection - The Mechanism of Evolution" by Graham
Bell, a book which I recommend highly to anyone who wants to learn more
about evolution, especially if they like to see good evidence for the claims
made for natural selection. I list the original references for some of
these so that anyone who wants more details will know where to look. The
title of the section from which these examples come is "A Single Clone
of Microbes Will Readily Respond to Natural Selection". I start out with
some examples of simple mutations, but in the section on <a href="#metabolic">evolution
of new metabolic pathways</a>, I present examples of series of mutations
that "build on one another" to add new metabolic pathways for the organism.
This is the very type of "new genetic information" that creationists frequently
claim is impossible.

<p>1.)&nbsp; <b>Adaptation to High and Low Temperatures by E. coli.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>A single clone of E. coli was cultured at 37 C&nbsp; (that
is 37 degrees Celsius) for 2000 generations. A single clone was then extracted
from this population and divided into replicates that were then cultured
at either 32 C , 37 C, or 42 C for a total of another 2000 generations.&nbsp;
Adaptation of the new lines was periodically measured by competing these
selection lines against the ancestor population. By the end of the experiment,
the lines cultured at 32 C were shown to be 10% fitter that the ancestor
population (at 32 C), and the line cultured at 42 C was shown to be 20%
more fit than the ancestor population. The replicate line that was cultured
at 37 C showed little improvement over the ancestral line.

<p><br>2.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Adaptation to Growth in the Dark by Chlamydomonas.</b>
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>Chlamydomonas is a unicellular green algae capable of photosynthesis
in light, but also somewhat capable of growth in the dark by using acetate
as a carbon source. Graham Bell cultured several clonal lines of Chlamydomonas
in the dark for several hundred generations. Some of the lines grew well
in the dark, but other lines were almost unable to grow at all. The poor
growth lines improved throughout the course of the experiment until by
600 generations they were well adapted to growth in the dark. This experiment
showed that new, beneficial mutations are capable of quickly (in hundreds
of generations) adapting an organism that almost required light for survival
to growth in the complete absence of light.</blockquote>

<p><br>3.) <b>Selection for Large Size in Chlamydomomas</b>
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>Bell also selected clonal lines of Chlamydomonas for size by passing
cultures through a fine filter and discarding the cells that were not retained
on the filter. He reports that although this method was not very effective
at retaining the largest cells (due to inconsistencies in the filter pore
size), after forty generations of this selection technique, the cell diameter
had increased by an average of about 1 phenotypic standard deviation.</blockquote>

<p>4.) <b>Adaptation to a Low Phosphate Chemostat Environment by a Clonal
Line of Yeast</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>P.E. Hansche and J.C. Francis set up chemosats to allow evolution
of a single clonal line of beer yeast in a phosphate limited (due to high
pH) environment. (A chemostat is a device that allows the propagation of
microorganisms in an extremely constant environment.) The yeast clones
grew slowly for about the first 180 generations when there was an abrupt
increase in population density. This was later shown to be due to&nbsp;
better assimilation of the phosphate, presumably due to an improvement
in the permease molecule. (Permease is an enzyme that controls what is
allowed to come into the cell through the yeast's cell membrane.) After
about 400 generations, a second improvement in cell growth rates occurred
because of a mutation to the yeast's phosphatase (an enzyme that improves
the cells ability to use phosphate). The phosphatase became more active
overall, and its optimal pH (the pH where it is most active) was raised.&nbsp;
Finally, a third mutant appeared after 800 generations that caused the
yeast cells to clump. This raised the population density in the chemostat
because individual cells were no longer being washed out of chemostat (which
is one of the methods that the chemostat uses to maintain very uniform
conditions) as quickly as they had prior to the mutation. (This is just
speculation on my part, but I wonder if it wasn't under some similar conditions
that multi-cellularity became favored over unicellularity - perhaps on
a sea bed or river bottom.)
<p>This experiment was repeated, and the same mutations occurred, but in
different orders. Also, in one replication, the processing of phosphate
was improved by a duplication of the gene that produces phosphatase. This
is experimental evidence of an extremely important mechanism in evolutionary
history! It is also a particularly elegant experiment because not only
was all of this adaptation shown to occur in clonal lines (descended from
a single individual), but the authors also determined the exact mutations
that caused the improved adaptations by sequencing the genes and proteins
involved.

after 10,000 generations</b>

<p>Edited by John R. Roth, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, and
approved February 3, 1999 (received for review July 21, 1998)
<p>Molecular methods are used widely to measure genetic diversity within
populations and determine relationships among species. However, it is difficult
to observe genomic evolution in action because these dynamics are too slow
in most organisms. To overcome this limitation, we sampled genomes from
populations of Escherichia coli evolving in the laboratory for 10,000 generations.
We analyzed the genomes for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP)
using seven insertion sequences (IS) as probes; most polymorphisms detected
by this approach reflect rearrangements (including transpositions) rather
than point mutations. The evolving genomes became increasingly different
from their ancestor over time. Moreover, tremendous diversity accumulated
within each population, such that almost every individual had a different
genetic fingerprint after 10,000 generations. As has been often suggested,
but not previously shown by experiment, the rates of phenotypic and genomic
change were discordant, both across replicate populations and over time
within a population. Certain pivotal mutations were shared by all descendants
in a population, and these are candidates for beneficial mutations, which
are rare and difficult to find. More generally, these data show that the
genome is highly dynamic even over a time scale that is, from an evolutionary
perspective, very brief.</blockquote>

<p><br>6.) <b>Adaptation of yeast to&nbsp; a glucose limited environment
via gene duplications and natural selection</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>When microbes evolve in a continuous, nutrient-limited environment,
natural selection can be predicted to favor genetic changes that give cells
greater access to limiting substrate. We analyzed a population of baker's
yeast that underwent 450 generations of glucose-limited growth. Relative
to the strain used as the inoculum, the predominant cell type at the end
of this experiment sustains growth at significantly lower steady-state
glucose concentrations and demonstrates markedly enhanced cell yield per
mole glucose, significantly enhanced high-affinity glucose transport, and
greater relative fitness in pairwise competition. These changes are correlated
with increased levels of mRNA hybridizing to probe generated from the hexose
transport locus HXT6. Further analysis of the evolved strain reveals the
existence of multiple tandem duplications involving two highly similar,
high-affinity hexose transport loci, HXT6 and HXT7. Selection appears to
have favored changes that result in the formation of more than three chimeric
genes derived from the upstream promoter of the HXT7 gene and the coding
sequence of HXT6. We propose a genetic mechanism to account for these changes
and speculate as to their adaptive significance in the context of gene
duplication as a common response of microorganisms to nutrient limitation.

<p><br>7.) <b>Molecular evidence for an ancient duplication of the entire
yeast genome</b>
<p>KENNETH H. WOLFE AND DENIS C. SHIELDS
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Gene duplication is an important source of evolutionary novelty.
Most duplications are of just a single gene, but Ohno proposed that whole-genome
duplication (polyploidy) is an important evolutionary mechanism. Many duplicate
genes have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and these often seem
to be phenotypically redundant. Here we show that the arrangement of duplicated
genes in the S. cerevisiae genome is consistent with Ohno's hypothesis.
We propose a model in which this species is a degenerate tetraploid resulting
from a whole-genome duplication that occurred after the divergence of Saccharomyces
from Kluyveromyces. Only a small fraction of the genes were subsequently
retained in duplicate (most were deleted), and gene order was rearranged
by many reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Protein pairs derived
from this duplication event make up 13% of all yeast proteins, and include
pairs of transcription factors, protein kinases, myosins, cyclins and pheromones.
Tetraploidy may have facilitated the evolution of anaerobic fermentation
in Saccharomyces.</blockquote>

<p><br>8.) <b>Evolution of a new enzymatic function by recombination within
a gene.</b>
<br>Hall BG, Zuzel T
<br>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1980 Jun 77:6 3529-33
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Abstract
<br>Mutations that alter the ebgA gene so that the evolved beta-galactosidase
(ebg) enzyme of Escherichia coli can hydrolyze lactose fall into two classes:
class I mutants use only lactose, whereas class II mutants use lactulose
as well as lactose. Neither class uses galactosylarabinose effectively.
In this paper we show that when both a class I and a class II mutation
are present in the same ebgA gene, ebg enzyme acquires a specificity for
galactosylarabinose. Although galactosylarbinose utilization can evolve
as the consequence of sequential spontaneous mutations, it can also evolve
via intragenic recombination in crosses between class I and class II ebgA+
mutant strains. We show that the sites for class I and class II mutations
lie about 1 kilobase, or about a third of the gene, apart in ebgA.&nbsp;
Implications of these findings with respect to the evolution of new metabolic
functions discussed.</blockquote>

evolution of new functions.</b>
<br>Hall BG
<br>Biochemistry 1981 Jul 7 20:14 4042-9
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>Abstract
<br>Wild-type ebg enzyme, the second beta-galactosidase of Escherichia
coli K12, does not permit growth on lactose. As part of a study of the
evolution of new enzymatic functions, I&nbsp; have selected, from a lacZ
deletion strain, a variety of spontaneous mutants that grow on lactose
and other beta-galactoside sugars. Single point mutations in the structural
gene ebgA alter the enzyme so that it hydrolyzes lactose or lactulose effectively;
two mutations in ebgA permit galactosylarabinose hydrolysis, while three
mutations are required for lactobionic acid hydrolysis. Wild-type ebg enzyme
and 16 functional mutant ebg enzymes were purified and analyzed kinetically
to determine how the substrate specificities had changed during the directed
evolution of these new functions. The specificities for the biologically
selected substrates generally increased by at least an order of magnitude
via increased Vmax and decreased Km for the substrate. These changes were
very specific for the selected substrate, often being accompanied by decreased
specificities for other related substrates. The single, double, or triple
substitutions in the enzymes did not detectably alter the thermal stability
of ebg enzyme.</blockquote>

a strain of bacteria improved fitness in a particular environment.</b>

of individual random mutations to genotype-by-environment interactions
in Escherichia coli</a>

<p>Edited by M. T. Clegg, University of California, Riverside, CA, and

<p>Numerous studies have shown genotype-by-environment (G&times;E) interactions
for traits related to organismal fitness. However, the genetic architecture
of the interaction is usually unknown because these studies used genotypes
that differ from one another by many unknown mutations. These mutations
were also present as standing variation in populations and hence had been
subject to prior selection. Based on such studies, it is therefore impossible
to say what fraction of new, random mutations contributes to G&times;E
interactions. In this study, we measured the fitness in four environments
of 26 genotypes of Escherichia coli, each containing a single random insertion
mutation. Fitness was measured relative to their common progenitor, which
had evolved on glucose at 37&deg;C for the preceding 10,000 generations.
The four assay environments differed in limiting resource and temperature
(glucose, 28&deg;C; maltose, 28&deg;C; glucose, 37&deg;C; and maltose,
37&deg;C). A highly significant interaction between mutation and resource
was found. In contrast, there was no interaction involving temperature.
The resource interaction reflected much higher among mutation variation
for fitness in maltose than in glucose. At least 11 mutations (42%) contributed
to this G&times;E interaction through their differential fitness effects
across resources. <b>Beneficial mutations are generally thought to be rare
but, surprisingly, at least three mutations (12%) significantly improved
fitness in maltose, a resource novel to the progenitor.</b> More generally,
our findings demonstrate that G&times;E interactions can be quite common,
even for genotypes that differ by only one mutation and in environments
differing by only a single factor.</blockquote>

<p><a NAME="metabolic pathways"></a><a NAME="metabolic"></a><b>Evolution
of New Metabolic Pathways</b>
<p>Some of the experiments that I described previously could be said to
have one weakness - they each only cover minor changes to an existing metabolic
pathway. Pages 229 - 243 of Graham Bell's book ("Selection - The Mechanism
of Evolution" Alexander Bell, 1997) also describe experiments that have
demonstrated that organisms are capable of evolving whole new metabolic
pathways, not just improving existing pathways. This is important to me
because it shows that evolution is capable of producing something new,
not just making minor improvements to existing pathways.
<p>The most common experimental process that leads to evolution of a new
pathway is this. An organism (usually bacteria) is put in a novel environment
- an environment that contains some resource (chemical) that the organism
has not been exposed to in the past. If that new chemical is the sole source
of some chemical the organism requires for survival (e.g. carbon or nitrogen),
most of the time, the organism will die. However, if any of the organisms'
existing enzymes have the slightest ability to enhance reactions with the
new resource, selection will strongly favor the duplication of the gene
that produces that enzyme, and future mutations will improve the ability
of the newly duplicated enzyme to process the new chemical resource. It's
not very hard to see that the same factors that are manipulated in these
experiments are going to occur in nature as well in the very long term.
This duplication and divergence "strategy" (in quotes because evolution
doesn't really have a strategy) of evolution appears to be capable of driving
evolution from the first pre biotic self-replicators to the present incredibly
complex and diverse life forms that occupy every imaginable niche of the
planet earth.
<p>1.) <b>Modifying the fucose pathway to metabolize propanediol.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>In normal anaerobic E. coli metabolism L-fucose is transported
into the cell and converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (which is used
for further metabolism) and lactaldehyde (which is a waste product). The
lactaldehyde is then converted to propanediol which is actively excreted
from the cell by a "facilitator" - a chemical that eases movement of another
chemical through the cell membrane in either direction. When E. coli lines
are exposed to an aerobic environment rich in propanediol, some individuals
are able to utilize this former waste as a food source. This is made possible
by a change to the enzyme that formerly converted the lactaldehyde to propanediol
to reverse its action and convert the propanediol to lactaldehyde. The
lactaldehyde can then be processed by the previously existing aerobic pathways
that use lactaldehyde as a carbon and energy source.

system in Escherichia coli. In R.P. Mortlock (ed.), "Microorganisms as
Model Systems for Studying Evolution" (pp. 135-164) Plenum, New York.</blockquote>

<p><br>2.) <b>Exotic five-carbon sugars</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Some five carbon sugars are very rare in nature, so very few
organisms have the ability to use these exotic compounds in their metabolism.
Robert Mortlock determined that the bacteria Klebsiella aerogenes was not
immediately able to metabolize D-arabinose and xylitol by growing strains
in media containing those compounds and noting the strains that were able
to grow only after a lag time. This indicated that the original strain
did not have the ability to process the compounds, but was able to evolve
such a capability. Mortlock then went on to see how this capability was
evolved.
<p>In the case of D-arabinose, Mortlock showed that the arabinose could
be utilized if it could be converted to D-ribulose by an enzyme (an isomerase).
Unfortunately, K. aerogenes has no such isomerase for the conversion of
D-arabinose. However, the isomerase for L-fucose has a low activity for
D-arabinose.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, the bad news is that the L-fucose isomerase
is normally produced only when the cell is exposed to fucose. Nonetheless,
in a few individuals, mutations occurred that allowed the fucose isomerase
to be produced at all times - not just when L-fucose is present. This is
normally a bad thing and would be selected against because it wastes the
cells resources by constantly producing an unneeded enzyme. In this situation
though, the mutation is a very good thing, and allows the cell to survive
because it can now metabolize arabinose (albeit rather poorly). Although
production of the fucose isomerase has been deregulated, the structure
of the isomerase itself has not been changed. The next mutation was a change
to the isomerase to make it more effective in the conversion of arabitol
to ribulose. Finally (although I can't tell from Bell's description if
this was actually done in the experiments), the culture could be selected
to regain control of the expression of the isomerase - so that it is produced
only when arabitol is present.
<p>Xylitol is also not normally metabolized, but Mortlock and his colleagues
were able to develop strains (generally through spontaneous mutations,
but sometimes with u.v. ray or chemical induced mutations) that could use
it because ribitol dehydrogenase (which is usually present in the cells
to convert ribitol to D-ribulose) was able to slightly speed up the conversion
of xylitol to D-xylulose, for which metabolic pathways already exist. The
ability of the strains to utilize xylitol was increased as much as 20 fold
when first production of ribitol dehydrogenase was deregulated (the enzyme
was produced all the time, not just when ribitol was present), then duplication
of the ribitol dehydrogenase genes occurred, then the structure of the
enzyme was changed such that its efficiency at working with xylitol was
improved, and finally, in at least one case, a line regained control of
the modified ribitol dehydrogenase gene so that the enzyme was only produced
in the presence of xylitol. Here we have a complete example of a new metabolic
pathway being developed through duplication and modification of an existing
pathway.
<p>Many papers were published concerning this group of experiments. For
a review, see:

<p>Bell goes on to give at least two more examples of the evolution of
new metabolic pathways.
