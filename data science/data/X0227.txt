Lessons for Improving Safety</h3>
Robert C. Cantu, MD; Frederick O. Mueller, PhD&nbsp;
<p><font size=-1><b>THE PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE</b> - VOL 27 - NO.
8 - AUGUST 1999</font>
<p><b>Ice hockey.</b> The absolute number of ice hockey injuries is low,
but the fatality and catastrophic injury rates per 100,000 participants
are higher than in many other sports. Catastrophic injuries in ice hockey
usually occur when an athlete is struck from behind or falls and hits the
crown of his or her head on the boards, resulting in fractured cervical
vertebrae and paralysis.
<p>Tator et al (5), who did an extensive survey on catastrophic injuries
in Canadian ice hockey, recommended the following:
<ul>
<li>
Enforce current rules and consider new rules against pushing or checking
from behind;</li>

<li>
Develop conditioning programs to help players strengthen their neck muscles;</li>

<li>
Teach players about the risk of neck injury; and</li>

<li>
Continue epidemiologic research.</li>

"Midway into the third period of the game Holt had a player on the outside
of him and had to catch up. Holt was going full throttle after him. Holt
went down on the ice with the other player on top of him as they went into
the boards. Holt couldn't get his arms out to protect his head and his
helmet wasn't enough." said his coach, Ed Loiselle.&nbsp;
<p>Loiselle realized immediately that something was seriously wrong. "He's
the type of kid that gets up right away, and this time he didn't. He's
one of our top four defensemen," Loiselle said, "extremely mature and extremely
strong. You don't see that in many sophomores. He has been doing a great
job. In wins and losses, we've been having a terrible year (1-11) but I
was thinking today and last night, we've learned some lessons on what is

<h3>
<a href="http://www.allina.com/Allina_Journal/Winter1996/brust.html">An
overview of ice hockey injuries in youth</a></h3>
<b>The Medical Journal of Allina</b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Risk factors</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ice hockey offers ample opportunity
for injuries: Players wear skate blades, use sticks, and shoot pucks. They
travel at high speeds, on a slippery surface, in a space that is confined
by boards. Moreover, some players play hockey as a collision sport.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Body Checking</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Clearly, body checking (collision)
increases the likelihood of injury. In a study of high school players,
<b>body
checking accounted for 38% of all injuries, with illegal play being responsible
for another 26%</b>. Collision accounted for 50% of all injuries in another
study of youth hockey. In still another study, body checking accounted
for 59% of all injuries (20% resulting from legal checking and 39% from
illegal checking), with rule violations being responsible for another 27%.
When fracture rates were compared in body-checking versus non-body-checking
leagues among 49 Canadian Peewee teams, researchers found that fracture
was 12 times more common in the body-checking leagues.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Body checking contributes not only
to the number of injuries sustained but also to their severity. In a study
of 117 hockey players with spine or spinal cord injuries, the most common
cause of such injury was a push or check from behind (by an opponent) that
catapulted the player headfirst into the boards.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nevertheless, collision is allowed
in boys' ice hockey at the Peewee level, even though size and physical
maturity differ considerably among boys under 16 years of age. Weight can
range from 34 to 70 kg (75 to 155 lbs) for Peewees and from 37 to 90 kg
(80 to 200 lbs) for Bantams. According to one study, larger Peewee players
exerted an impact force 70% greater than that exerted by their smaller
teammates.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lax Rule Enforcement</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rule enforcement is especially important
in a game that can result in serious injury or death. One youth hockey
study, however, showed that for 29 injuries resulting from tactics judged
illegal, only four penalties were assessed. Also, researchers studying
catastrophic injury noted that rules were frequently not enforced and players
were injured as a result of illegal play.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Violence</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Violence in hockey is a problem at
all levels of play, including the youth level, and body checking contributes
to it. Investigators in one study described the environment of one in three
youth hockey games in which an injury occurred as hostile: Players called
one another names and fought; parents became angry; and referee calls were
hotly disputed. Fifteen percent of all injuries were deemed intentional.
The same authors found that 26% of Peewee and Bantam players who understood
that checking from behind could cause serious injury or death reported
that they would be willing to do so if "angry" or to "get even." According
to another group of researchers, the risk of concussion was four times
higher among players who identified "Playing hockey helped me to get rid
of tensions and aggressions" as their first or second reason for playing
than among those who identified other reasons.</font></td>

Hockey Injuries</a></h2>
<b>Hughston Sports Medicine Foundation</b>:
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What causes most injuries?</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Studies show that most hockey injuries
occur during games rather than practices. It is estimated that direct trauma
(a sudden forceful injury) accounts for 80% of all injuries. Most of these
injuries are caused by player contact (checking and collision), falls,
and contact with a puck, high stick, and occasionally, a skate blade.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Penalty!!!</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been estimated that as many
as one-third of injuries are caused by foul play. Many have observed a
need for increased vigilance in this area, particularly at the adolescent
and high school levels. Establishment and enforcement of effective rules
have led to fewer injuries.&nbsp;</font></td>
