<H1>Professional Experience</H1>
</p>

<ul>

<li>
1999 June - present: Tenured position as a
Research Biologist,
Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology,
NIH, NCI, CCR.

<li>
December 1987 - June 1999: Senior Staff Fellow or Investigator,
Laboratory of Mathematical Biology,
(Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute,
National Institutes of Health, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center,
Maryland)

<li>
January 1987-November 1987: Postdoctoral Research Associate with Gary Stormo,
Department of Molecular, Cellular and
Developmental Biology, University of Colorado<br>

Conclusion of the T7 promoter experiment, described below.

<li>
1984-1986:  Postdoctoral Research Associate with Larry Gold,
Department of Molecular, Cellular and
Developmental Biology, University of Colorado<br>

I did a randomized synthetic
DNA genetic engineering experiment to
determine whether
the excess information at bacteriophage T7 promoters is
used by the polymerase (Schneider1989).
The experiment was successful, and showed that the T7 polymerase
does not use the excess sequence conservation.  This supports
the hypothesis that a second protein binds.

<li>
1978-1984:  Ph.D. candidate, Department of Molecular, Cellular and
Developmental Biology, University of Colorado

I designed and wrote a computer language called Delila for manipulating
DNA sequences (Schneider1982,Schneider1984) which we used to
investigate the statistics of ribosome binding sites
(Gold1981,StormoInitiation1982).
We used this system to train a perceptron to identify
ribosome binding sites, and so we were the first group
to apply neural networks to the problem of
finding nucleic acid binding sites (StormoPerceptron1982).
I designed and built plasmids for studying the
quantitative relationships between sequence and function
of ribosome binding sites (Childs1985,Stormo1986,Barrick.ribosomes1994).
My thesis was on the information content of nucleic-acid
binding sites (Schneider1986).  It describes the
excess information (excess sequence conservation)
found at bacteriophage T7 promoters.  This
purely mathematical calculation led me to
predict the existence of a second binding protein.

<li>
1980:  Teaching Assistant, Molecular Genetics, University of
Colorado

I graded tests and helped students to understand the material.


<li>
1979:  Teaching Assistant, Cell and Tissue Biology, University of
Colorado

I taught two lab sections and graded tests.


<li>
1974-1978:  Undergraduate, Department of Biology, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts

I worked at the Architecture Machine in the Department of Architecture
on a computer system to recognize visual scenes by parallel processing.
I did this on a serial processor since no parallel processors
were available at that time.
This work was funded for the summer of 1977 by the MIT
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program.


<li>
1975 and 1976:  Computer Aide, Space Environment Laboratory, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder, CO (summer)

I designed and wrote programs to display meteorological data
gathered in real time on a NOAA airplane flying through storm
systems such as hurricanes.
