              exciting young distance talents, Matt Downin is currently living 

              and training at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, 

              California. A 2000 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Downin 

              has already found some post-collegiate success, finishing 7th in 

              the 10,000m at last summer's U.S. Olympic Trials and qualifying 

              for the final of the 5,000m. Most recently, Downin won the USATF 

              Fall Cross Country Nationals in Boston on November 25, 2000. He 

              spends most of the year in Madison, Wisconsin where he lives, works 

              and trains with his older brother Andy, also a national class runner.

              The [U.S. Olympic] Training Center provides room and board for athletes 

              as long as they get approval from USA Track &amp; Field and as long 

              as they're ranked in the top 15 in their event. Not many people 

              do take advantage of it. We had heard about it back in July and 

              one of the things that I've always wanted to do, even though I do 

              like it in Madison, was come out here for the months when we get 

              hit with cold and snow. I decided it was a good time to come out 

              here, get some nice weather and hook up with Mebrahtom (Keflezighi), 

              James Menon and Jon Clemens, who ran for the Naval Academy. It's 

              actually a really great setup for distance runners because they 

              take care of pretty much everything. The food is really good and 

              there's plenty of it.</font></p>

              I work 20 hours a week at the running store in Madison, called Movin 

              Shoes. I work there with my brother (Andy) and I work short shifts 

              pretty much every day, which is perfect for training because we 

              don't need to be there until 10:45 or 11:00 most days. We have plenty 

              of time to wake up and take care of our running. We do most of our 

              workouts in the morning before work, and Andy and I do most of our 

              running together because our schedules are pretty much the same. 

              It's a nice setup for us in Madison. </font></p>

              with Meb, who is a year-round resident at the Center, but still 

              get my workouts from back in Madison. [I thought I'd] do a lot of 

              workouts alone because I wasn't really sure what Meb was doing and 

              I didn't want to take myself that far out of my comfort zone &#150; 

              I still wanted to do the workouts that I felt like I needed to do. 

              But I got out here and James Menon is here and Jon Clemens lives 

              in town and Jerry and I talked and we both saw the value of hooking 

              up with them and doing their workouts and trying to make it fit 

              into my schedule as opposed to not going with them in order to stick 

              to my schedule. It turns out that Meb does a lot of similar stuff 

              that we did back in Madison and things have just worked out really

              people do. Andy and I took a big chunk of time off in August and 

              refocused ourselves in September so we kind of had a slow fall. 

              We spent a lot of time just running easy tempo runs and some really, 

              really easy repeat work, just to get our legs back during the fall. 

              So until I got out here, I was just kind of continuing with that 

              and it was my goal to continue that theme of keeping stuff healthy, 

              staying fresh and still getting in the good, consistent work. </font></p>

              like you're on the right track with your Fall (Cross Country) Nationals

              somewhat surprised, but obviously not too surprised because I don't 

              think you can win something if you don't go in thinking you can 

              win it. I went in really not knowing where I was at &#150; like 

              I said, we spent a lot of time doing really easy workouts this fall. 

              I didn't focus on the Fall Nationals race as a big deal, it was 

              going to be the one big thing I did to test where I was at. I ran 

              a road race two weeks before and kind of got my butt kicked by two 

              guys who were going to be in the race, so I wasn't really sure where 

              I was at. I like cross country, it's something that I've always 

              excelled at, and combine that with staying fresh, being healthy 

              and having a consistent two months of training... I think I just 

              ran above my fitness level on that day, and plus I was back home. 

              It was nice, I hadn't been home for Thanksgiving since I went off

              and Jason Vanderhoof who was 8th at the NCAA Cross meet was fifth 

              or sixth. We put a really good mile together and we're going to 

              try keep doing it. Hopefully we can get our numbers up so we have 

              a community thing going. A mile is nice because anybody can show 

              up and do it, pretty much.</font></p>

              </font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, 

              I definitely was encouraged by it. One of themes for me going into 

              that was that if you're a U.S. runner, you don't really get to compete 

              at a much higher level in the United States. Until you make World 

              teams or until you go to Europe, the Olympic Trials is the Big Thing 

              that happens every four years. It was very exciting. I had been 

              eighth the year before at the U.S. Championships and I just kind 

              of went in thinking I needed to do something like that to set myself 

              up so that next year I can go in trying to make a team or something 

              like that. I ended up having the best week, running wise, of my 

              life because I turned around two days after the ten and ran 13:44 

              and made the finals of the five. It was, for me, probably equally 

              as impressive (as his seventh-place finish in the 10,000m) considering 

              how bad my spring had been. I really ran one good race in April 

              (Mt. Sac) and then didn't run well at all until the Trials, so it 

              was a long time to go without any success.</font></p>

              from college last spring, have you found that it's tough to &quot;make

              </font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's 

              been fine. I think I'm blessed with a few things, one is that my 

              parents have always supported my running. I didn't really have the 

              kind of spring that I wanted, so I wasn't able to go and find (a 

              sponsor) that would take care of me financially. My parents were 

              really great about saying hey, we understand that this is something 

              you really want to do and if you need $100 here or $100 there, then 

              that's fine. The financial side is the only thing that's a little 

              harder when you get out of college because there's all these things 

              that you now need to take care of, like plane tickets and shoes, 

              that were always just kind of an afterthought in college. But other 

              than that, I've found that things have been easier because I was 

              never one who enjoyed going to class every day, and then showing 

              up at practice at 2:30 really tired... From day one of being a post-collegiate 

              athlete, I kind of got into a really good rhythm of doing workouts 

              at a certain time, and we were in a situation that really just seemed 

              to work for me. And I think I did have some success this fall because 

              I was able to find a groove really quickly and not take myself out 

              of what was successful for me in college, but do away with some 

              of the things I think maybe that hampered me. And then having people 

              around to run with helps. Mark Coogan moved to Madison in August 

              and I do quite a bit of my running with him, and obviously my brother, 

              Rod DeHaven, Pascal Dobert lives in town and I try to run with him 

              as much as possible, and not to mention the college team. I still 

              live with a couple of guys who are on the college team and a wide 

              range of people to go out and do your daily runs with is great.</font></p>

              really speak for everyone else, but I really think we got soft somewhere 

              along the line. I've talked to a lot of the old-school runners who 

              were around in the 60s and 70s. There are Americans who have done 

              great things and I think the guys who do that are just harder than 

              everyone else. They're willing to go out and do the work and put 

              in the effort and put in the time, and I think that's what it is. 

              Just plain and simple hard work. Obviously that's hard to do. I 

              hope that over the next couple years I can just become a better 

              trainer and become someone who can run at the level of a guy who 

              wants to run 13:00 or 27:30 or 27:20. And the other part of it is 

              changing your mindset. Americans in the last 10 years have been 

              able to say &quot;well, if I run 13:45, I probably will still be 

              able to make a little money and do a couple of road races and be 

              successful.&quot; I think the days of thinking like that have to 

              come to an end. You have to think higher in order to run higher. 

              You're not going to go into a race thinking, &quot;Oh, I'm going 

              to run 13:30&quot; and then just happen to run 13:10. For me, those 

              steps are in the future because I haven't broken 13:40 and I haven't 

              run under 28:45. I'm thinking that this year I have to go out and 

              get halfway there -- run 28 minutes or 28:10, run 13:25 or 13:30, 

              but hopefully I can take those steps this year and the following 

              year take further steps.</font></p>

              Andy who got me into running. My oldest brother ran track and did 

              the high jump. He probably did something to get Andy into track 

              and field a little bit. Andy was four years older than me so when 

              he was in high school, I was in sixth, seventh, eighth grade and 

              I would go over to his track meets and watch him run. That was the 

              kind of thing that got me pretty excited about running. He had a 

              coach that was helping him out that lived in Massachusetts and I 

              would talk to him a lot, and I did some of the youth track meets 

              in seventh and eighth grade. I never really trained for anything. 

              Our coach always felt that you didn't want to push someone hard 

              to train when they were young so he always told me, &quot;oh, just 

              relax.&quot; Even when I was a freshman in high school, he told 

              me not to work too hard, not do too much when I was too young, but 

              just get excited about the sport. I started running competitively 

              as a freshman, really. I had a little bit of success and it was 

              just something that I enjoyed. It's always been something that I 

              enjoyed. There were times in college when I didn't enjoy it and 

              I thought about quitting, but when I'm enjoying it, I have success.

              year it was not so much injury problems but me kind of beating myself 

              up. There were a lot of things off the track that I wasn't taking 

              care of. I had a lot of problems. March of my sophomore year (my 

              redshirt freshman year) I kind of had a blowout with my coach and 

              basically quit the team for about six weeks. When I was away from 

              it, I continued to run because I always believed that running was 

              something I liked. The thing that I was not enjoying about it was 

              all the other extraneous stuff that was just beating me down. During 

              that time when I wasn't going into practice, I think that I actually 

              rediscovered why I came to the sport to begin with &#150; that it 

              was fun and something that I enjoyed doing. So when I came back, 

              I made it clear to Martin Smith, who was the coach at the time, 

              that I was coming back, but I wanted to enjoy it. I wasn't going 

              to beat myself up over it anymore, I wasn't going to not be happy 

              with it anymore. I was going to do what I wanted to do, I was going

              up running 3:45 on the track the following spring, and 1:50 flat... 

              I enjoyed it that spring because I did what I wanted to do. Somewhere 

              along the line, I found the fire again &#150; that following fall

              We had a guy on our team at Wisconsin, Jay Schoenfelder, who didn't 

              even make it to Foot Locker Nationals and he was my teammate for 

              five years. He was a great guy and a great teammate and kicked my 

              butt 50 percent of the time. I always had to tell myself, &quot;don't 

              put that pressure on yourself.&quot; I really didn't train that 

              hard in high school and I was really frail, really small. I had 

              a really immature body. I knew from my brother and from talking 

              to people that I would have a hard time in college. I was immature, 

              I hadn't trained really hard. I knew there were steps that I had 

              to take in mileage and in workouts that I didn't take in high school 

              that other people took. I ran about 40-45 miles a week at the height 

              of my training, which is pretty low. So I knew that those steps 

              were going to be hard for me and I knew that there was going to 

              be injuries along the way that would be setbacks. I still look at 

              it that way because I still haven't taken all the steps that people 

              who graduated with me from college took and I know that post collegiately, 

              if I want to keep doing this, there are going to be a lot of steps 

              in training that I have to take. That's one of the reasons why I 

              came out here. I knew that I could just follow in somebody's footsteps 

              who is doing the things I wanted to do and kind of try to find my 

              way through it that way. In college I never really ran over 85-90 

              miles per week which was still pretty low for someone who wanted 

              to run the 10,000m on the track and someone who wanted to do great 

              in cross country.</font></p>

              other than the fact that I love Madison, it's a great place to be 

              as a runner, I have a coach there and I live with my brother and 

              I have a lot of great friends. But if I felt like this was something

              Well, I work two days a week at the running store in La Mesa (just 

              outside of San Diego). It's actually a <a href="http://www.movinshoes.com/" target="_new">Movin 

              Shoes</a> too. The guys who started the store used to live in Madison 

              and they both went to [the University of Wisconsin] as undergrads 

              and they moved out here and opened a store that uses the same name. 

              I just work on Wednesdays and Saturdays. They said I could come 

              in whenever I wanted, stay as long as I wanted and leave whenever 

              I wanted to go do a run, which is about as flexible as you can be. 

              It's nice to still be able to make a little money. But the rest 

              of the days, we sit around and watch TV a lot and spend a lot of 

              time sitting in the dining hall, just talking.</font></p>
