<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>VRML&nbsp;Models</H1>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="rule01.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=468></P></CENTER>

<P><B>Two Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)&nbsp;models - one representing
the <A HREF="#mw">Milky Way Galaxy</A> and another the <A HREF="#IPD">Interplanetary
Dust Cloud</A> - are described on this page. These models can be used as
instructional tools. They can be manipulated (rotated, panned and zoomed)
using a VRML&nbsp;browser, giving the user the sense that the models are
real, tangible objects. </B></P>

<P><B>Browsing software can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/">VRML&nbsp;Repository</A>
maintained by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). The models described
here are VRML&nbsp;1.0 models which, unfortunately, do not display properly
in all VRML&nbsp;2.0 browsers. <A HREF="http://www2.iicm.edu/vrweb">VRWeb</A>
is a free browser that works well. Recommended browser settings are &quot;wireframe&quot;
and black background color.</B></P>

<H3><A NAME="mw"></A>Milky Way model</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="milky_way.wrl">Milky Way VRML&nbsp;model</A> is based on
a statistical representation of the three-dimensional density distributions
of stars of various spectral types (colors). Hot, luminous blue stars are
concentrated close to the Galactic plane and in the spiral arms. Cool,
red stars are distributed in a thicker layer about the plane and concentrated
in the bar (&quot;bulge&quot;)&nbsp;at the Galactic center. The stellar
density distributions are those published by <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1992ApJS...83..111W">Wainscoat
<I>et al.</I> (1992)</A> for the main disk, and <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995ApJ...445..716D">Dwek
<I>et al.</I> (1995)</A> for the bulge. A Monte Carlo method was used to
sample the density distributions, yielding a 44,000-star representation
of the Galaxy. The real Milky Way contains about 100 billion stars. Using
a VRML&nbsp;browser, one can &quot;fly into&quot;&nbsp;the model to the
location of the solar system to view the Galaxy from our unique vantage
point in the disk, about 8.5 kpc from the Galactic center. Our understanding
of the shape and orientation of the Galactic bulge was improved with the
help of the COBE&nbsp;DIRBE&nbsp;near-infrared data. At visible wavelengths,
those to which our eyes are sensitive, interstellar dust clouds block background
starlight, producing an obstructed view of the center of the Galaxy, as
is illustrated in the <I><A HREF="http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/mw">Multiwavelength
Milky Way</A></I>. The VRML&nbsp;model is similar in many respects to the
Faint Source Model used by the DIRBE&nbsp;Team to represent the Galactic
near-infrared starlight in the search for the cosmic infrared background
(<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9805323">Arendt <I>et al.</I>
1998</A>).</P>

<P>The Milky Way VRML&nbsp;model is one of six such models created for
an educational project called <I>iUniverse</I>, which is currently under
development.</P>

<H3><A NAME="IPD"></A>Interplanetary Dust Cloud model</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="ipd_monte.wrl">Interplanetary Dust Cloud VRML&nbsp;model</A>
represents the distribution of dust in the solar system, as derived from
the COBE&nbsp;DIRBE&nbsp;observations. Like the Milky Way model <A HREF="#mw">described
above</A>, the dust distribution is represented statistically, using a
Monte Carlo technique. Careful modeling of the DIRBE&nbsp;infrared data
led to the understanding that dust in our planetary system is concentrated
in several distinct structures: a smooth cloud, three asteroidal dust bands,
a circumsolar ring near 1 AU, and a small cloud of dust that trails the
Earth in its orbit around the Sun (<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9806250">Kelsall
<I>et al.</I> 1998</A>). The points representing each cloud component in
the VRML&nbsp;model were assigned a unique color, enabling the components
to be distinguished from each other.</P>
