								</center>
								<div align="left">
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Since jobs are the reason you would visit JobsInMotorsports.com, we do not charge employers for posting using this site and posting their jobs. Free job posting for employers means more jobs posted. Although we do charge candidates for some services, we think you will find our fees exceptionally reasonable. </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Listing Your Resume on the JobsInMotorsports.com</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><strong>&#153;</strong></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b> Databank *</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Registration entitles you to enter your resume in the JobsInMotorsports.com databank where motorsports employers can search for it. As a registered candidate you will receive a weekly newsletter notifying you of new job postings and other additions to JobsInMotorsports.com. Registration also gives you access to the Candidates' Resources we offer and the services for candidates described below.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">You may register on JobsInMotorsports.com</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">&#153;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"> databank for <i>FREE FOR ONE YEAR </i>(a year and a half if you enter an Agent Code when registering). Also, as long as you maintain a Job Applications Service subscription (see below), your registration will not expire. In other words, you can keep your registration free indefinitely as long as you continue a subscription.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Registration fees for subsequent years are: $4.95 if purchased prior to expiration of your registration and you have purchased any Resume Forwarding or Job Applications Service subscription in the 12 months prior to expiration, $9.95 if purchased prior to expiration of your registration and you have<i> not</i> purchased any Resume Forwarding or Job Applications Service subscriptions in the 12 months prior to expiration. If your registration has expired, the fee is $19.95.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">You will be notified by email 10 and 2 days prior to expiration of your registration. If it is a free registration that is expiring, the email will contain a link to a fast, straightforward &quot;just enter your credit card info&quot; renewal process. If a paid registration is expiring, however, renewal will be automatic. In that case, the emails will contain a link to take you to our website page where you can cancel the renewal and prevent the charge to your credit card with just a couple of clicks.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Resume Forwarding To Groups Of Motorsports Employers *</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">The Resume Forwarding service lets you send your resume to groups of employers you select. For example, all race engine suppliers are in one group while racing teams are grouped by the series they participate in (click on the Employer Group button to the left to see the groups and participating employers in each group). You can send your resume to every employer in the group with one button click. Also, you will be notified of employers added to a group within one year and can send them your resume.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">When you purchase Resume Forwarding for a group you will be able to select specific members of the group to NOT send your resume to. You can use this feature to prevent sending your resume to your current employer or to target specific employers within a group.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Subscription to the Job Application Service *</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">When you subscribe to the Job Application Service for an employer group, you are notified by email of new job listings in the group(s) as soon as they are posted (instead of at the end of the week). You can specify specific job titles you are interested in. A link in the email will take you to the page on the JobsInMotorsports.com</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"> web site</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"> where you can apply for that job with one click. Your resume will be emailed to the employer's hiring person identifying itself as an application for that position.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">With this service you can also include your custom &quot;cover letter&quot; text at the top of the email.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Your subscription entitles you to apply for as many jobs in that group(s) as you want (until you cancel the subscription). Another benefit of a subscription to the Job Application Service is that your registration will not expire as long as you have a subscription. </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">You can subscribe for 30 days, 90 days or one year at a time. Renewal is automatic unless you cancel your subscription. Cancellations are simple and convenient. You will receive email notification 10 days and 2 days prior to automatic renewal with a link to the cancellation page for that subscription. To renew, do nothing and your credit card will automatically be billed for the next subscription period on the last day of the current subscription period. </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">PLEASE NOTE:</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">We do not keep your credit card number. The automatic renewal is handled by the credit card processing company. In the unlikely event someone gains access to our servers, they cannot obtain any credit card numbers from it because there are none there. </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">We make every effort to remind you frequently that this automated billing is about to take place and give you the opportunity to easily and conveniently stop it if you no longer need the service. We realize that this kind of automated billing makes some people uncomfortable, including ourselves, because most services using it seem to intentionally make it easy to forget you are being billed and hard to stop. However, we believe we have solved those problems while keeping job information coming your way without any effort on your part..</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Group Pricing *</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Our fees are structured by group. Premium groups include NASCAR Winston Cup Teams, CART FedEx Teams, etc. Most groups will have the &quot;Plus&quot; pricing applied to them. Standard groups include those where there are few employers (most groups start out at this pricing level and get shifted to Plus pricing once there are a significant number of employers in them) or where most jobs are volunteer positions.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Package Pricing</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">To provide candidates with the greatest economy on the services that will do you the most good, JobsInMotorsports.com offers discounts on packages of services. Purchased together, the Resume Forwarding and either 90 day Job Applications subscription or 1 year subscription to the same group provide savings of approximately 30% over buying 30 day subscriptions and Resume Forwarding separately.</font></p>

									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">FAQ: Why do we charge by groups? Basically, we charge by groups for simplicity, economy and effectiveness for you, the candidate. You need to make your resume available to as many employers as possible in order to increase your chances of landing the job you want. Charging by group makes that feasible for you and avoids the luck factor of choosing which employers to forward your resume to (and maybe choosing wrong). Also, charging by group means you do not have to go through the purchase procedures over and over again.</font></p>
