<h2>Level 2 science requirements</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Achieving these break-through science objectives requires a
new mission with a dramatic improvement in sensitivity beyond that of the
COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and the forthcoming
INTEGRAL mission. Recent technical advances, including the development of 3-dim
position-sensitive solid-state and noble gas detectors, make the Advanced
Compton Telescope (ACT), with 25&#8211;100 times better sensitivity relative to
COMPTEL, possible in the near future.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>
The improvement in sensitivity of the ACT comes from improvements in angular
resolution, from improved energy and position resolution, and from increased
detection efficiency. Another improvement considered for ACT is tracking the
Compton-scattered electron to further refine the direction of each incoming
gamma ray. The large field-of-view (approaching 2<span style='font-family:Symbol;
mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:
symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>p</span></span>-sr) is also a significant
improvement &#8211; enabling discovery and monitoring of many transient
sources. </p>

<h2>Connection between science requirements and engineering requirements </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The new technology that all the ACT instrument concepts
share and depend on is &quot;gamma-ray tracking.&quot; This is an entirely new
field, opened up for the first time by the powerful new detector technologies
that are now available. Tracking is the science of stringing together each of
the individual interactions that a gamma ray undergoes in the proper order,
based solely on the energy loss and positions of these interactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are currently 3 (or 4) competing approaches to develop
the best Compton &quot;gamma-tracking&quot; detector for ACT. These include Ge
and Si(Li) solid state detectors, and liquid and high pressure Xe), Since the
launch of ACT is probably not less than 10 years off, the lack of a single instrument
concept at this time is not a weakness. These detector groups all agree that the
required performance can be achieved with any of these approaches. The principal
aspect of the competition is to minimize the instrument cost while optimizing
the science goals described in the white paper. The general sense of the
community is that ACT, a major NASA mission, should achieve a sensitivity of ~3<span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span
style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>&acute;</span></span>10<sup>-7</sup>
ph cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. </p>

<h2>Technological challenges<o:p></o:p></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The detector technologies currently proposed for ACT, Si(Li),
Ge, and LXe, are all reasonably sound at this time, i.e. they work well and
produce understandable signals. Further, these currently available detectors are
good enough to do the job. No break-through detector technology is required. The
HP Xe detector, as an alternative to LXe, is a possible exception and may
produce a better ACT detector since it enables recoil electron tracking. The
chief advantage of recoil tracking is an added background rejection capability,
improved angular resolution, and possibly the use of events with larger scattering
angles. The improved imaging is probably not important for point sources, but
may help in mapping extended emission from diffuse sources. However, achieving
the sensitivity goals below 1-2 MeV, due to high-energy threshold, poor energy
resolution, and large Doppler broadening effect, needs to be demonstrated with
simulations and a lab demonstration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are, with all these approaches, important
technological developments that are needed to make a large-scale, space-qualified
3-dim tracking instrument. These challenges include the following.</p>

<h3>Track imaging detector event processing</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The development of computer tools to accurately simulate,
and process, 3-dim gamma-ray tracking detector data is lagging somewhat behind
the detector development. Improvements are needed in the Monte Carlo simulation
of medium- and high-energy photon interactions. Specifically, improvements are
needed in the momentum and energy distributions, including polarization effects,
of the recoil electron from Compton scattering and the electron and positron from
pair production. </p>

<h3>Front-end electronics development</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A low-power CMOS readout appears necessary. Each element, or
cell, of the 3-dim Compton track imager requires separate front-end electronics.
The front-end electronics for each cell, with 10-20 pF capacitance (10-15 cm
strip length), must provide energy resolution on the order of 2 keV FWHM with
less than 3 mW/channel power consumption. Although this is more of an
engineering issue, it does not require a new break-through technology. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Cooling technology </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cooling technology for a large 3-dim solid state detector will
require new innovative designs. The use of large copper cold fingers is not
viable (replacing them with lightweight Be is only marginally better). The
cooling technology for Si(Li) is already being done as part of a DTRA application
at NRL. NRL is also working on a new technique for the Si(Li) concept using
fluid loops, which can move more heat/mass than passive conductive material. Cooling
of a Germanium instrument is a harder task because the cooling requirements are
more difficult, but has the advantage of fewer electronic channels because the
detectors are bigger. Cooling of the electronics with the Lxe and HP Xe
approaches is much less of a concern. </p>

<h3>Cost and Cost reduction</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cost of semiconductor detectors is high and a large
volume of detector is needed to achieve the required ACT sensitivity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cost of the germanium, based on the cost of
sophisticated segmented coaxial detector produced by Eurisys for DoE's GRETA
program, will be on the order of not less than $20M. Use of this type of Ge
detector will require Ortec/Eurisys (or someone) to set up a fab-line
specifically for the program (perhaps ~$1M). The use of larger Ge crystals is
possible and could save money and complexity by requiring fewer crystals but
would cost perhaps $2-3M to set up the crystal growing facility. It is not
likely that the germanium cost can be brought below $20M, but it should be possibile
to keep it the $20-40M range, including handling and assembly (electronics not
included). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A reliable cost model for Si(Li) is not currently available,
however it is likely to have similar cost and production issues as Ge. Appropriate
segmented Si(Li) devices are produced in Germany and LBNL is working on a
technology in parallel. There is no commercial source, although the techniques
used should be easily commercialized. A foundry needs to be set up for the ACT
to produce Si(Li). The silicon needed is readily available float-zone material
in the 0.5-2 k<span style='font-family:Symbol;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>W</span></span>
range, which is easy to make and not too expensive. The Li drifting equipment can
be installed in a foundry for less than $2M.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cost and technology issues for LXe or HP Xe detectors
are different. The challenge of building a large 3-dim tracking detector is
more easily addressed with the xenon approaches. There are, however, other
challenges, such as gas cleanliness and confinement. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Launch readiness metrics and status</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Launch readiness can be assessed in terms of detector prototype
demonstrations (simulations, lab and accelerator tests, and balloon flights) that
address the technological challenges, indicate the required sensitivity can be achieved.
Readiness is further demonstrated by instrument designs that optimize the
science return, i.e. maximize the field-of-view, sensitivity, and angular
resolution. </p>

<h3>Track imaging detector event processing</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the key technology, without which the proposed detector
concepts will not achieve the science goals of ACT. The astrophysics community is
not alone, the low-energy nuclear physics community (DOE and Europe) is also working
to exploit gamma-ray tracking for their next generation radioactive beam
experiments. This should have applications within nuclear medicine as well. The
recent release of Geant IV, in C++, facilitates the inclusion of improved/enhanced
interaction models. The needed improvements can be expected to occur quickly. </p>

<h3>Front-end electronics development</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The need for low-power, multi-channel front-end electronics
is not unique to the ACT detector concepts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, many groups at universities and Federal laboratories
are developing ASICs for front-end electronics.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately the development cost of an ASIC is high
(~$150k) and the lead-time is long (~1-2 years).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, detector development and ASIC design are often out of
phase: a sufficient number of front-end electronic channels is unavailable preventing
realistic detector testing to determine the ASIC requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are currently several ASICs available commercially
which are adequate for initial detector testing. These chips, however, are
fairly expensive (~$200-300 ea.), difficult to get in quantity, and are not &#8216;plug-and-play&#8217;
devices. Funding is needed now, prior to pre-phase A, to support multiple, intermediate
ASIC designs for the development of the ACT detectors. </p>

<h3>Cooling technology </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cooling technologies are being worked on for various other
missions, e.g. GLAST and Si(Li) application mentioned above. Although solutions,
specific to the various detector technologies discussed here, do not exist
current efforts are likely to be successful. </p>

<h3>Cost and Cost reduction </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The competition between the various detector technologies
will result in the maximum science return for the least cost. The status of the
cost reduction will have to be assessed relative to other major missions such
as GLAST. </p>

<h2>Technical readiness demonstrations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The demonstrations required to validate of a detector
technology will include demonstrations of the technical readiness of the
front-end electronics, cooling technology, and gas issues. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The overall detector technology
validation will require testing of require irradiated detectors, accelerator
tests, and/or a balloon mission or two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The efficiency of gamma-ray track imaging, as well as
background rejection, hinges on getting the sequence of interactions correct.
Preliminary studies show that this will work, but a great deal of modeling and
additional work is essential, especially with respect to background rejection. This
work can occur independent of the detector technology and will eventually be
validated by detector testing and balloon flights. </p>

<h2>Required capability</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is the required capability a reasonable extension of the
current capability or does it require a significant advancement or new
approach? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The required capabilities of the launch readiness metrics,
track imaging, front-end electronics, cooling technology, and cost reduction, are
all reasonable extension of the current capability. </p>

<h2>Technology addressing</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The specific technological challenges discussed above are
similar to, and would be useful to, other applications but are not being specifically
addressed for other applications. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
3.0pt;margin-left:0in;page-break-after:avoid;mso-outline-level:3'>The gamma-ray
track imaging event processing development has applications for several other gamma-ray
