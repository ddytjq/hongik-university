                to stocks and shares it is possible that its value may fall below 
                the amount originally invested as the price of units/shares and 
                the income from them can go down as well as up. This may also 
                happen as a result of changes in the rate of exchange where overseas 
                securities are held. The value of shares can go down as well as 
                up. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. 
                Because of the cost of buying and selling stock market investments, 
                which will impact on the value of your investment in the short
