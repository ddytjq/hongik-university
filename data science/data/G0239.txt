<b> 1.1 Introduction</b><p>

This catalog is a collection of digital images of 113 galaxies.  These
galaxies were 'photographed' using CCD devices and each galaxy was
taken using two or three color filters. Altogether we have 257
pictures, which are available in three different file formats.
Including the header files the catalog consists of more than 1000
files.  Images of 31 galaxies were taken with the 1.5 meter telescope
of the <a
href="http://astro.caltech.edu/observatories/palomar/">Palomar
Observatory</a> in 1991 in 3 passbands of the Thuan-Gunn system:
<i>g</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>i</i>. Images of the other 82 galaxies were
taken with the 1.1 meter telescope of the <a
href="http://www.lowell.edu/">Lowell Observatory</a> in 1989 in 2
passbands (<i>J</i> and <i>R</i>) of the photometric system developed
by Gullixon et al.  At Palomar we used a camera with an 800x800 TI
CCD, at Lowell the camera had an RCA 512x320 CCD.

<p>

This User Guide will give you all the information on how the catalog
was constructed, how to use these pages, and how to get the best image
quality on your screen. <a href="#html">Below</a> are a few remarks
about the HTML files. We also have a very short <a
href="#galaxies">introduction</a> to galaxies and galaxy
classification. Please take a look at the <a
href="#acknow">acknowledgment</a> where we have listed the many people
who contributed their efforts to the construction of this catalog
during the past years. In section 2 we describe the various <a
href="cat_ug_2.htm#formats">file formats</a> selected for this catalog
and list image display <a href="cat_ug_2.htm#viewers">programs</a> for
different computer platforms.  Also described is the <a
href="cat_ug_2.htm#lut">algorithm</a> we used to convert the images to
the various file formats.

<p>

In section 3 of this User Guide we summarize the <a
href="cat_ug_3.htm#observations">observations</a> and <a
href="cat_ug_3.htm#processing">image processing</a> steps. This
chapter is a shorter version of the paper we published about this
catalog in the Astronomical Journal. The full paper is also <a
href="cat_ajp.htm">available</a> in HTML, PDF, and PostScript formats.
Many <a href="cat_ug_3.htm#properties">properties</a> (like the Hubble
type, size, brightness, position on the sky) of the catalog galaxies
are listed there.  The <a href="cat_ug_4.htm">last section</a> is a
description of how we constructed the color images based on the images
taken with different color filters.

<p>

Starting from the first page of the catalog you have two options to
select the galaxy you want to view. You can either look at a set of <a
href="cat_ims.htm">thumbnail-size images</a> and select the galaxy by
clicking on the image, or you can select the desired galaxy based on
its <a href="cat_ngc.htm">New Galaxy Catalog (NGC) number</a>. After
you make this selection you will be presented with a screen that
describes the galaxy and allows you to select the desired file format
and to pick the passband of your choice. Clicking on the small image
corresponding to the file format and filter you chose will bring up
the full-size image of the galaxy.

<p>
<a name="html"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 1.2 HTML guide</b><p>

Due to the wide-spread use of web browsers, there is no need for
extensive description of how to handle these pages. We want to make only
three important points, specific to the data presented in this
catalog.

<p>

Most important, the catalog is a collection of high-quality images,
both in browser-supported JPEG and GIF formats, and also in FITS,
which are not viewable within web-browsers. Depending on how the
browser allocates the color-cube when it is started (this usually
depends on the color depth of your setup and the number of colors
still available for allocation), you may have more or fewer colors
available to render JPEG and GIF images within the browser. If the
number of colors is low, some of the image display programs we listed
in <a href="cat_ug_2.htm#viewers">section 2</a> of this User Guide
will give you better results with JPEG and GIF than your browser does.

<p>

After you select a galaxy - either by browsing through the thumbnail
images or the NGC numbers - you will be presented with a page
that describes the galaxy and gives you options of file formats and
filters before actually viewing the full-size image. Obviously,
JPEG, GIF, and FITS images will have different file sizes (JPEGs being
the smallest and FITSs being the largest). To help you select the
format you find optimal for your needs and network connection speed,
the latest versions of the most popular browsers will display the file
sizes if you move your cursor over the postage-stamp-sized preview
images.

<p>

The CD-ROM version of the catalog holds all the data that is part of
the catalog itself (HTML files, galaxy pictures, etc). You do not have
to be connected to the web to take advantage of our data.  However,
throughout these pages, especially in the User Guide, we linked many
pages found on the World Wide Web, which provide supplementary
information. You do not need these to use the catalog, but they can
provide useful background information.  Obviously, by using the CD-ROM
version of this catalog you will be able to follow the links to the
web <i>only</i> if you are connected to the Internet.

<b> 1.3 About galaxies: a brief introduction</b><p>

The existence of galaxies is clearly evident today, but it was not
evident at all at the beginning of this century. Even a couple of
hundred years ago the only celestial objects known to us were
point-like sources: planets, satellites, comets (as well as the Sun
and the Moon) in the Solar System, and relatively steady, distant
stars.

<p>

While working at an Observatory in Paris in 1758, looking for Halley's
comet, Charles Messier first discovered extended, faint objects in the
sky. He called these nebulae, and started to catalog them to aid
observations of comets, his main interest at that time. The first
entry in his catalog, M1, turned out to be what we call today the Crab
nebula, the remnant of supernova 1054. When he published his famous <a
href ="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/Messier.html">catalog</a>
in 1781, he listed 103 nebulae. Seven more objects were added to his
catalog later.

<p>

The nature of the nebulae was constantly questioned, primarily because
telescope resolution was not good enough during the last century to
see detail in these objects. In 1920, the National Academy of Sciences
in Washington organized a <a
href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate20.html">debate</a>
for Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis concerning the nature of the
nebulae, or, more precisely, about "The Scale of the Universe." The
two opposing theories were that (a) the Universe is rather small,
containing nebulae that are nearby gas-clouds, and (b) the nebulae are
very distant "island Universes." The debate was centered around three
key issues: (1) how to measure the distance to these objects, (2) how
to determine the material composition (gas or many-many stars), and (3)
why is there a "zone of avoidance," a region of the sky where nebulae
are not found.

<p>

A few years later, Edwin Hubble settled the issue. He isolated Cepheid
variable stars in the Andromeda galaxy (which is M31) and measured the
distance to these stars. The distance turned out to be much larger
than the possible size of the Milky Way; therefore M31 must be a
distant "island Universe," a spiral galaxy, similar to our own. Hubble
started to take pictures of many galaxies and soon realised that they
come in many shapes and sizes. In order to make sense of his findings
he implemented a subjective method of morphological classification,
based on the optical appearance of these systems.

<p>

The two distinct types of galaxies he discovered were ellipticals and
spirals. Spiral galaxies are divided into two groups. Some are normal
spirals, with a bulge in the center and spiral arms extending out from
the central regions, and barred spirals where spiral arms originate
from the tips of a straight bar, going through the center of the
galaxy. He also introduced the classes of lenticular and irregular
galaxies. Lenticulars are "between" ellipticals and spirals.  They
consist of a large bulge with a small flattened disk around them,
without visible spiral structure. Irregular galaxies, which account
for about 5 percent of the galaxies we observe nearby, are forming,
colliding, dynamically disturbed systems that do not fit in any of
the other three categories.

<p>

Hubble constructed a "tuning-fork" diagram to illustrate his
classification system. He put elliptical (E) galaxies on the stem of
the fork. Indices 0 to 7 subdivide this class. An E0 galaxy is a
round-looking elliptical, while E7 is very elongated in appearance.
Lenticulars are denoted S0 (or SB0, with a bar), and subdivided to
classes <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i>, based on dust absorption
within their disks. Spirals are denoted S (normal) or SB (barred).  To
distinguish among spirals, he introduced <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and
<i>c</i> classes. An Sa (or the barred version, SBa) has a large bulge
and relatively weak, tightly wound spiral arms; on the other end, an
Sc (or SBc) has a small bulge and strong, open spiral arms. Below is a
simple illustration of the tuning-fork diagram using representative
galaxies found in our catalog:

<p>

<img width=10 height=1 src="space.gif">
<img width=634 height=465 border=no src="Uguide/tfork.gif" alt="Hubble's
tuning fork diagram">

<p>

Since the first half of the twentieth century, tens of thousands of
galaxies have been imaged with various kinds of instruments and
telescopes. We saw many galaxies not fitting the simple classification
system of Hubble, which led to a proliferation of extensions to his
system (for example, that of De Vaucouleurs, who made the tuning fork
three-dimensional with the distinction between s-shapes and rings, and
added classes Sd and Im to the sequence), and, more recently, efforts to
automate the classification task. You will find an immense amount of
information on this subject in popular science books, introductory- to
graduate-level textbooks, and in several well-constructed pages on the
web.

<p>

Since we imaged the nearest, largest systems, 22 out of the 40
galaxies found in the Messier catalog are included in our collection
(the rest of the nebulae in the Messier catalog turned out to be
nearby gas and dust clouds, supernovae remnants, globular or open
clusters of stars, or simply a not-well-resolved double star). Among
the 22 galaxies we have 16 spirals

<b> 1.4 Acknowledgment</b><p>

It is our pleasure to acknowledge the great number of people who
participated in the observations and data reductions. Their work made
it possible to construct the catalog presented here.  Students at the
Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University, did
observations at Lowell as part of a student project. We thank Jill
Knapp and Anthony Tyson for organizing and leading the project. We are
indebted to several people at Lowell: Jay Gallagher, who made it
possible to use the observatory for the project, Craig Gullixson, who
helped with the telescope, Neal Hartsough and Rick Wenk who built the
software system, Anthony Tyson again, who built the camera, and Robert
Lee for the camera-software.

<p>

We are greatly indebted to the former students who took part in the
data acquisition and reduction: Arif Babul, Renyue Cen, Charles
Gammie, Bin Gao, Lynne Hillenbrand, Neil Katz, Man Hoi Lee, Joanna
Lees, Kevin Long, Shude Mao, Jordi Miralda-Escude, Changbom Park,
Duncan Walsh, and David Weinberg.&nbsp; We acknowledge very useful
discussions with Robert Lupton and Neil Tyson.  The patience of the
Palomar time allocation committee, who continued to give time for this
project through five completely clouded-out years, is also much
appreciated. We are indebted to Peter Teuben for his help to conform
with the FITS standard.
