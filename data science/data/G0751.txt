Sir Frederick William Herschel (1738-1822) was
born in Hanover, Germany, and became well known as both a musician and
an astronomer.  He emigrated to England in 1757, and with his sister
Caroline, constructed telescopes to survey the night sky.
Their work resulted in several catalogs of double stars and nebulae.
Herschel is perhaps most famous for his discovery
of the planet Uranus in 1781, the first new planet found since antiquity.
<p>
In the year 1800, Herschel made another very important
discovery.
He was interested in learning how much heat passed through the different
colored filters he used to observe the Sun and noticed that filters of
different colors seemed to pass different levels of heat.  Herschel
thought that the colors themselves might contain different levels of heat,
so he devised a clever experiment to investigate his hypothesis.

Herschel directed sunlight through a glass prism to create a spectrum -
the "rainbow" created when light is divided into its colors - and
measured the temperature of each color.
He used three thermometers with blackened bulbs (to better
absorb the heat) and placed one bulb in each color while the other two
were placed beyond the spectrum as control samples.  As he measured the
temperatures of the violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red light, he 
noticed that all of the colors had temperatures higher than the controls and 
that the temperature of the colors increased from the violet to the red part
of the spectrum.  After noticing this pattern, Herschel decided to measure
the temperature just <i>beyond</i> the red portion of the spectrum in a region
apparently devoid of sunlight. To his surprise, he found that this region
had the highest temperature of all.
<p>
Herschel performed further experiments on what he called the "calorific rays"
that existed beyond the red part of the spectrum and found that they were
reflected, refracted, absorbed and transmitted just like visible light.
What Sir William had discovered was a form of light (or radiation)
beyond red light.  These "calorific rays" were later renamed <i>infrared rays
</i>
or <i>infrared radiation</i> (the prefix <i>infra</i> means `below').
Herschel's experiment was important not only because it led to the
discovery of infrared,  but also because it was the first time that
someone showed that there were forms of light that we cannot see with
our eyes.

Museum of Science and Industry in London, England.

Today, infrared technology has many exciting and useful applications.
In the field of infrared astronomy, new and fascinating discoveries are
being made about the Universe.  Medical infrared imaging is a very useful
diagnostic tool.  Infrared cameras are used for police and security work as
well as in fire fighting and in the military.  Infrared imaging is used to 
detect heat loss in
buildings and in testing electronic systems.  Infrared satellites have
been used to monitor the Earth's weather, to study
vegetation patterns, and to study geology and ocean temperatures.
