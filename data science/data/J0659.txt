<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many clubs comment that they experience
difficulty in recruiting youngsters to their ranks.&nbsp; This Guideline
has been produced for the <a href="index.html">Club Manual</a> as a possible
way of overcoming the problem because it describes a successful series
of lessons in basic navigation organised by one club for local teenagers.&nbsp;
The exercise could equally well be run for regular club members interested
in learning about the basics.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The course came into being
when an <a href="http://www.oxfordmotorclub.co.uk/">Oxford Motor Club</a>
member, whose son attended the local scouts, heard that they required someone
to teach the boys map reading for their scouting badges.&nbsp; The club
was then approached to provide the tuition in the scout hut and the course
culminated in a short, 15 mile navigational exercise, run on a treasure
hunt permit - 1Omph overall average speed, no time schedule other than
overall limit, crews not being asked to carry out any dangerous manoeuvres
on public roads K 21.6.3. Code boards were used to check correct route
and a timed, table top, tie decider (a "herringbone" problem to give an
answer of "the next spot height") was used to find the award winners, the
nav-ex having been set so that the boys should all be able to have the
satisfaction of getting it right.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This proved to be
a successful venture in that the boys seemed to pick up what they had been
taught, they enjoyed their navigational exercise, they still talk about
it 18 months on, the club perceived real worth in introducing 11-15 year
olds into a branch of motor sport that they had never heard of, and the
scout leader got time to catch up on paperwork as someone else was looking
after the scouts.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This example is worked on <a href="http://www.oxfordmotorclub.co.uk/">Oxford
Motor Club</a>'s own map - <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/products/Landranger/specific.cfm?lrm_no=164">164</a>.&nbsp;
Potential class tutors should read through this example with map 164, then
work out their own route on their own <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/">O.S.</a>
map.&nbsp; The class will find it easier to learn where familiar names
crop up.&nbsp; Of course, the local map will be required for the navigational
exercise and to highlight map features.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No visual aids were used, other than
the map.&nbsp; Simple, photocopied sheets, issued singly along with the
subject matter were employed to set the various examples (and to illustrate
the pictorial clues - tulips and herringbones.&nbsp; A "flip chart" could
of course be used instead.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction (week one)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Early man did not need maps as he didn't
stray far from his cave, or mud hut and could remember his way back anyway!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Once man started sitting
on horses, or riding in carts, maps could be drawn to relate to other men
how to find places further afield.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle ages map
making became more common and as the great explorers discovered the world
away from Europe, maps were drawn, if for no other reason than a ruler
could have some idea of what made up his empire.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; In Britain we have some
of the best maps in the world in the <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/">Ordnance
Survey</a> maps - the most commonly used being the <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/products/Landranger/index.cfm?shop_id=1">1:50,000
scale Landranger series of 204 sheets</a> which cover England, Scotland
and Wales and their associated islands.&nbsp; Development of the Ordnance
Survey dates back over 200 years to when wars with France posed a threat
of invasion.&nbsp; The military authorities called for accurate mapping
to help plan defences and the Ordnance Survey came into being.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Map features, references and the romer
(week one)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Using the local Landranger map, it is possible
to look at the town and its surrounding area where the class is taking
place.&nbsp; Rivers, railways and the roads of differing colours are immediately
obvious, plus built up areas, buildings and woodlands.&nbsp; Closer examination,
with reference to the map's legend, of the towns shows up post offices,
pubs, bus stations, railway stations and various types of churches.&nbsp;
By concentrating on the locality familiar to the class, the Ordnance Survey's
attention to detail can be put across.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Three quarters of the way
down the legend, one can see the instruction "<a href="../../hartmc/map_ref.html">HOW
TO GIVE A GRID REFERENCE</a>" (BRITISH NATIONAL GRID).&nbsp; The purpose
of a map reference is to define a point accurately in a way that everyone
understands and the "six-figure reference" is our system.&nbsp; Go through
the example on the particular sheet.&nbsp; To remind people of Eastings
before Northings tell them that people crawl (along) before they walk (upright).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now introduce the class
to the romer.&nbsp; Show them how to position it on the sample reference
and show them how easy it makes estimating the "tenths" and, indeed, by
introducing "half tenths" an even more accurate positioning is possible.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point give the
class some examples to do - respond with six-figure references for easily
identified local points (FOR EXAMPLE USING MAP 164 - the telephone box
in Cuxham (667953) Ewelme Church (6461/2914) Wittenham Clumps View Point
(5661/2928)) and also to plot some references that you have set (e.g. 656930
Brightwell Grove).</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Plotting a route (week one)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To use maps in a rally car, we will draw
the route that we intend to follow on the map.&nbsp; We will be using roads
so we will mark our route by drawing a single line, always on the left
of our proposed route, parallel to the roads to be used (ideally about
3mm to the left) following the road's natural features, bends, junctions
etc.&nbsp; The single line saves pencil over "tramlining" (which a lot
of people use) and if you ensure that you always mark on the left of your
route, it will quickly always show your direction of travel (be it West
to East or East to West for example), something not immediately necessarily
obvious with tramiines.&nbsp; Don't draw on your roads - this may obscure
detail that your driver may need later.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Map references and direction of approach/departure
to define a route (map 164) (week two)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From the sample point, Knightsbridge Farm,
leave to the South West.&nbsp; We would write this as 686971 SW.&nbsp;
At the bottom of the track, we are going to turn right so taking the junction
at 684968, we approach from the NE and leave to the NW.&nbsp; This is written
as (approach) NE684968 NW (depart).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now set the class the following:
SE 6749781/2SSW, E6591/2962W, SE650'/,,964N, E6453/49711/2W to a finish
at NNE6439681/2.&nbsp; Check their route, check that they have marked it
up properly, single line on the left.&nbsp; Marking each point could be
either a dot or a small circle.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Numbers to define a route (week two)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We can use various numbers to define a
route by listing the order in which the route uses these numbers.&nbsp;
The grid lines (the blue lines 2cm apart that traverse the map) and the
spot heights (e.g. 88 in grid square 6797) that are a point levelled relative
to sea level are common numbers used.&nbsp; Our example route is now: START
686971 97 97 68 88 67 97 85 66 65 78 97 97 FINISH AT NEXT JUNCTION.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a good opportunity
to show the class the "shortest route" principle which takes us round the
south of the triangle at 6451/4972 (Hampden's Monument).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example should
be set again checking the accuracy of the plot and also their single line
neatness.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tulip diagrams (week three)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is a system of using pictures of the
junctions that was developed on the Tulip Rally in Holland in the 1950s.&nbsp;
In the same way that a real tulip grows from the bulb to the flower, a
rally route using "Tulips" goes from the ball to the arrow - e.g.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our sample route now becomes</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that junctions to
Golden Manor (6701/2974) and Easington (6659661/2) are not depicted in
these instructions - because they are dead ends, or "non goers" there is
no point showing them as our rally route would not use these roads (unless
the rally was to finish at that location).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for another example,
with the usual checks made on the responses.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Herringbones (week three)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By joining up our "tulips" in our example,
we end up with:</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This looks at first sight
to be of little use, but if we adopt a straight line as the route that
we follow, and leave the roads which join our road sticking out the side,
we get a useful format for route description.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of instruction
is called a "herringbone" because it looks a bit like a fish carcass that
has been stripped by the local tom cat!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Following our example should
be done thus: Start on a white, miss a left (turn right onto yellow), miss
two rights (turn left at crossroads), miss two lefts and one left (straight
over at Cutt Mill), miss a left (turn right onto yellow), miss a right
(at the Hampden's Monument triangle, bear left), miss a right (bear left
again) and finish at next junction.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying it as "miss a left"
takes away any confusion between turning right at a T-junction, going straight
on past a junction on the left or turning right off a road (all of which
are covered by that instruction).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Pause for breath, and go
through this example again with the class - it is the most advanced concept
so far.&nbsp; It is used in many road atlases to show motorways' (particularly
M25) junctions.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now set another example,
again being hot on accuracy of both plot and presentation.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Table top practice (week four)</font></b></h2>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Time for consolidation.&nbsp; Using
all that you have shown the class, work out a route that gives the class
about eight or ten junctions for each type of navigation - references (with
approach and departure directions), numbers, tulips and a herringbone.&nbsp;
The aim should be to provide a straightforward test - the students must
have the satisfaction of getting it right - the quicker ones will get there
unaided, the slower ones may need your help.&nbsp; This help should be
of the "leading questions" form, not just solving the problem for them.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; With all students, emphasise
the need for clear map marking - dots or small circles for the references,
the route lining being consistently on the left of the route (in the direction
of travel) and following the bends in the road, without obscuring detail
that will be needed later.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To close this session,
a few words are necessary on the forthcoming nav-ex, and how best to navigate
a driver around a route.&nbsp; Occasional use of the word "rally" does
wonders for the anticipation.&nbsp; Tell the class that they must call
up junctions in advance - if they can incorporate distances to the next
junction, so much the better (one grid square = 1 km, half a grid square
= 500m) and keep instructions (to the driver) simple - e.g. "300m to turn
left at a crossroads".&nbsp; Use of map features can be helpful - e.g.
"turn right opposite a church".</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nav-ex (week five)</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is run under a Treasure Hunt (K 21.6.3)
Certificate of Exemption.&nbsp; Remember to state that "Members of the
Public are to be carried in competing cars" when applying for the Certificate,
in your Motor Club's name.&nbsp; Fifteen miles (one and a half hour duration)
allows sufficient time and distance to use the techniques learned (but
the most difficult, the herringbone, should be kept for a tie decider).&nbsp;
The drivers should be briefed to supply "leading questions" help if required
by their passengers.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the aim should be
for the students to successfully complete the test (particularly if scouting
badges are to be issued as a reward).&nbsp; This also encourages students
to come back for more if they feel that they have stumbled on a sport that
is novice friendly.&nbsp; The route handout should tell the class to look
out for the codeboards (make these large and bright and show a sample at
the start) and position them so that they are clearly visible.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though apparently politically
incorrect these days, it is desirable to declare a winner and it is surprising
just how enthusiastic youngsters become when a pair of normal Motor Club
trophies are paraded before them for the winning navigators.&nbsp; A herringbone,
timed to the second, leading to a clear solution - e.g. the value of a
spot height after the last junction of the herringbone, is an ideal tie
decider.&nbsp; Remember to get the crews to write down their answer, not
to shout it out or they will be amazed at how quickly the opposition comes
back with the same solution!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Another "boost" for the
group, and particularly the winners, is to see their names in the local
paper, so send in a report (and photographs, if possible) to the motor
sports correspondent.&nbsp; Don't forget to credit the Motor Club for running
the course.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Conclusion</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was a worthwhile project in many ways,
the class was enthusiastic and receptive, it gave Motor Club teachers a
chance to brush up on speaking skills away from people that know them (an
important factor for those more backward in coming forward) but above all,
it was pleasing to be able to get youngsters interested in motor sport.&nbsp;
Similar courses have been run for further Scout and ATC (Air Cadet) groups
locally.</font></b>
