<b><font size=+2>The epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)</font></b>
<P>
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a vascular tumor that was brought to the attention of the medical 
community over a century ago in a fascinating case series in which purple-coloured nodular 
skin lesions were observed on five elderly men, with widespread cutaneous and visceral 
involvement reported in one patient at autopsy (Kaposi, 1872 as cited in Ober, 1988). This 
'Classic' variant of KS is rare and the majority of cases are found in elderly Mediterranean 
men and Jewish people born in Eastern Europe (Rothman, 1962). Large-scale epidemiological 
studies have highlighted three other variants of KS; 'African' or 'Endemic' KS in young 
black adults and children in equatorial Africa (Davies and Lothe, 1962; Oettle, 1962), 
'Iatrogenic' or 'Posttransplant' KS in patients who have previously received 
immunosuppressive therapy or in those who are organ transplant recipients (Klepp et al., 
1978; Harwood et al., 1979; Penn, 1979) and 'AIDS-related' or 'Epidemic' KS, first noted in 
immunocompromised homosexual men from New York and California (Friedman-Kien et al., 1981). 
All four forms of KS have a predilection for males and the male:female ratio ranges from 
2.3:1 in Iatrogenic KS to 106:1 in Epidemic KS and the clinical course of epidemic/AIDS-KS 
is more aggressive (Friedman-Kien and Saltzman, 1990). The strikingly unusual pattern of KS 
distribution begs the question as to what features, if any, are common to the four 
epidemiological variants of KS.
<P>
A major advance in our comprehension of KS epidemiology came from studying the distribution 
of 13616 KS cases among 90990 persons with AIDS reported to the Centers for Disease Control, 
Atlanta, until March 31, 1989. Detection of KS in 21% of males who acquired HIV-1 through 
homosexual or bisexual contacts in comparison with <7% in all other HIV transmission groups 
such as heterosexuals of Caribbean, African and other origin, intravenous drug users, 
transfusion recipients and persons with haemophilia suggested that epidemic KS might be a 
sexually transmitted infection (Beral et al., 1990). Similar conclusions for the existence 
of a separate KS agent as the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma in the context of HIV-1 infection 
were drawn from a Canadian cohort study (Schechter et al., 1991).
<P>
<b><font size=+2>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)</font></b>
<P>
<b>Discovery and classification of KSHV in the rhadinovirus lineage of the 
gammaherpesvirinae </b>
<P>

Given that there may be a separate KS agent, it was reasoned that the genomic difference 
between proposed infected (KS) and uninfected (skin) tissues from an individual patient with 
AIDS-KS should be that of the infectious agent. Two herpesvirus-like DNA sequences, named 
KS330Bam and KS631Bam, were discovered using the PCR-based technique, Representational 
Difference Analysis, that preferentially identifies these differences. It was possible to 
amplify the KS330<sub>233</sub> sequence by PCR from DNA extracted from 25/27 (93%) AIDS-KS 
tissues compared with 6/39 (15%) lymph nodes and lymphomas from AIDS patients without KS 
(X<sup>2</sup>=38.2, p<10<sup>-6</sup>), suggesting that this Kaposi's sarcoma-associated 
herpesvirus (KSHV) might be the proposed KS agent (Chang et al., 1994). The associations 
between KSHV (also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) for taxonomic purposes) and Kaposi's 
sarcoma among other diseases are discussed in more detail below.
<P>
Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of a 20.7-kb fragment from an AIDS-KS genomic library 
placed KSHV in the <i>gamma</i>2 (Rhadinovirus) lineage of the gammaherpesvirinae along with 
Herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS). The closest human relative is the <i>gamma</i>1 
(Lymphocryptovirus) herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) (Moore et al., 1996a). This 
finding is intriguing for the relationship that gammaherpesviruses have with 
lymphoproliferative disorders and cancer; HVS can induce malignant lymphomas in owl monkeys 
and marmosets (<i>Aotus</i> and <i>Saguinus</i> sp.) (Melendez et al., 1969b) and EBV 
infection is linked to a fatal B-cell proliferation in young males with X-linked 
lymphoproliferative disease, posttransplant lymphomas, immunoblastic lymphomas in AIDS 
patients, Burkitt's Lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma and Hodgkin's Disease (reviewed in 
Rickinson and Kieff, 1996).
<P>
Rhadinoviruses are found in many species and several examples have been identified in 
non-human primates; HVS in <i>Saimiri sciureus</i> (Melendez et al., 1968, 1969a), ateline 
herpesviruses (HVA) in <i>Ateles geoffroyi</i> (Melendez et al., 1972), rhesus rhadinovirus 
(RRV) in macaques (Desrosiers et al., 1997) and retroperitoneal fibromatosis herpesvirus in 
both <i>Macaca mulatta</i> (RFHVMm) and <i>Macaca nemestrina</i> (RFHVMn) (Rose et al., 
1997). Two distinct rhadinoviral sequences from African Green Monkeys have also been 
identified and these viruses are termed Chlorocebus rhadinovirus (ChRV) 1 and 2 (Greensill 
et al., 2000). Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA polymerase gene sequences from these 
primates show that there may be two distinct rhadinoviral lineages in Old World primates 
comprising respectively KSHV/RFHV/ChRV1 and RRV/ChRV2 (Fig.1).

</font>
<P>
Of these animal rhadinoviruses only the New World representatives (HVS, ateline herpesvirus) 
and RRV grow well in tissue culture and can therefore be used in animal models. HVS causes 
lymphomas in owl monkeys  and marmosets (<i>Aotus</i> and <i>Saguinus</i> sp.) (Melendez et 
al., 1969b) and despite the close relationship to KSHV, RRV only causes benign 
lymphoproliferations in experimentally infected macaques (Wong et al., 1999). RFHV has been 
detected in macaques suffering from retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF) (Rose et al., 1997). 
Currently this virus can not be grown in tissue culture and attempts to induce RF 
experimentally by inoculations with RFHV-containing macaque samples have not yet been 
successful (Bosch et al.,1999).
<P>
<b>The nucleotide sequence of KSHV provides insight into KS pathogenesis</b>
<P>
The genome of KSHV has been mapped with cosmid and phage genomic libraries from a Primary 
Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) cell line (BC-1) and a KS biopsy specimen (Russo et al., 1996; 
Neipel et al., 1997b,c). The BC-1 KSHV genome and, due to an overall genomic difference of 
only 0.4%, the KS biopsy genome have a 140.5-kb-long unique region (LUR) which is flanked by 
multiple 801bp terminal repeat sequences (Fig.2). Within the LUR, 81 potential Open Reading 
Frames (ORFs) with greater than 100 amino acids have been identified and several additional 
spliced genes have since been added to this list. The numbering of KSHV ORFs is based on 
positional homologies with HVS due to substantial collinearity between these genomes whereas 
ORFs without positional homologues are numbered consecutively with a K prefix. The overall 
G+C content in the LUR is 53.5% and 84.5% in the terminal repeat sequence. The LUR consists 
of both conserved herpesviral genes that are involved in herpesvirus replication and 
structure and non-conserved genes that may provide insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms 
of this virus (Russo et al., 1996). This review will focus more specifically on viral 
proteins (designated with the prefix v(-)) such as interleukin 6 (vIL-6/ORFK2), macrophage 
inflammatory proteins (vMIP-II/ORFK4 and vMIP I/ORFK6), (vBck/ORFK4.1), (vBcl-2/ ORF 16), 
interferon regulatory factors 1-4 (vIRF1/ORFK9, vIRF2/ORFK10, vIRF3/ORFK10.1, vIRF4/ORFK4), 
FLICE-inhibiting protein (v-FLIP/ ORF71), cyclin (v-cyclin/ORF72), interleukin8- like/ G 
protein-coupled receptor (v-IL8R/ vGPCR/ORF74) and a multiple membrane spanning protein 
(LAMP/ORFK15). The presence in the viral genome of open reading frames with significant 
homology to mammalian genes involved in cellular growth control suggests that Amolecular 
mimicry of cell cycle regulatory and signaling proteins is a prominent feature of this 
virus'(Russo et al., 1996). The function and expression of these viral genes are discussed 
in more detail below.

Figure 2. The KSHV genome is 140.5kb long and is flanked by multiple terminal repeat 
sequences which are depicted as hatched squares. Three classes of transcript are recognised 
(Sarid et al., 1998); class I transcripts are constitutively expressed in PEL cells and 
these latent transcripts are coloured black, class II transcripts are expressed at low 
levels during latency but can be induced chemically and are shaded grey and class III 
transcripts are only present following chemical induction and are represented in white.  It 
should be noted that the nut-1 transcript is not translated. Blocks of structural genes that 
are conserved between most gammaherpesviruses are labelled I-V. This diagram shows 
"non-conserved" genes that are discussed in the text and the map is not to scale.</font>
<P>
<b>Tracing the origin of KSHV </b>
<P>
Comparison of protein sequences predicted from the genomes of Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) 
and EBV suggests a common mammalian herpesviral ancestor (Davison and Taylor, 1987). 
Phylogenetic studies of alphaherpesvirinae genes and proteins using maximum parsimony and 
distance methods with evaluation by bootstrap analysis have shown that the molecular 
evolution of mammalian alphaherpesvirinae in the majority of cases parallels the evolution 
of their mammalian hosts (McGeogh and Cook, 1994). Based on the assumption of virus and host 
co-speciation over the same evolutionary timescale, similar phylogenetic analyses on common 
mammalian herpesviral ancestral genes such as uracil-DNA glycosylase imply that the 
differentiation of alpha, beta and gammaherpesvirinae occurred between 180 and 220 million 
years ago and that major sublineages in the herpesvirinae were generated before the 
mammalian radiation of 60-80 million years ago with subsequent coevolution of virus and host 
(McGeogh et al., 1995).   
<P>
Analysis of the KSHV genome suggests that 42 genes are common to a set of genes that the 
mammalian herpesviral ancestor may have possessed. Eighteen genes are shared by the 
gammaherpesvirinae whereas 9 genes belong to the rhadinovirus lineage and 17 genes are 
specific to KSHV sublineage. There is also some preliminary phylogenetic evidence that the 
two Old World _2 herpesviruses KSHV and RRV separated from the New World HVS sublineage at 
the same time as the Old and New World primate separation approximately 35 million years ago 
and that KSHV and RRV sublineages separated with their hosts about 25 million years ago 
(McGeoch and Davison, 1999). 
<P>
<b>Variation in ORFK1 sequences can be used to identify KSHV subtypes </b>
<P>
Precedents for sequence variation in specific regions of gammaherpesvirus genomes are found 
in the work on EBV nuclear antigens, EBNA-2A, -2B, -3A, -3B and -3C (Dambaugh et al., 1984; 
Sixbey et al., 1989; Sample et al., 1990), EBV Latent membrane proteins LMP-1, -2A and -2B 
(Sample et al., 1989; Miller et al., 1994; Busson et al., 1995) and HVS Saimiri 
Transformation Protein (STP) A- B- and C- alleles (Medveczky et al., 1984).
<P>
The most variable region to date in the KSHV genome appears to be ORFK1. The full length 
ORFK1 protein is predicted to encode a  transmembrane protein (aa 1-289) consisting of the 
following regions; an extracellular domain (aa1-228) with an amino terminal signal peptide 
and an immunoglobulin receptor-like domain with two variable regions (VR1 and VR2), a 
transmembrane domain (aa 229-261) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (aa 262-289) which 
contains an immunoglobulin-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). (Russo et al., 
1996; Lagunoff and Ganem, 1997; Neipel et al., 1997b,c; Lee et al., 1998a; Nicholas et al., 
1998; Cook et al., 1999; Zong et al., 1999).
<P>
Phylogenetic analyses using ORFK1 sequences obtained from different geographic regions, 
including 50 Classic and AIDS-KS and 10 Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL)/Body Cavity Based 
Lymphoma (BCBL) DNA samples, enabled the definition of four major subtypes (A, B, C and D) 
with bootstrap values greater than 70% and 83% for linear and radial unrooted dendrograms 
respectively (Nicholas et al., 1998; Zong et al., 1999). Prototype A, B and C DNA sequences 
have been previously defined on the basis of lesser degrees of intersubtype (1-1.5%) 
nucleotide variation in ORFs26/75 (Zong et al., 1997). In contrast, the ORFK1 sequences of 
these prototypes differed by 5.8-14.6% at the nucleotide level and 14-29% at the amino acid 
level and this sequence appears to be more reliable for examining strain variability. 
Interestingly almost 85% of the nucleotide differences led to amino acid subtitutions and 
the majority of these changes were concentrated in VR1 (aa 54-92) and VR2 (aa 199-227) for 
all subtypes with more extensive involvement of the amino terminus in subtype B. Minimal 
differences were seen in the putative transmembrane domain for all three subtypes whereas 
the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic tail for subtype A and C differed by 12/38 (32%) 
amino acids from subtype B. Subtype variants were defined in this study on amino acid 
differences greater than 5% or on the presence or absence of specific diagnostic deletions 
in the ORFK1 sequence. There is evidence that particular subtypes and variants are 
associated with particular geographic regions; A1, A4 and C3 variants were frequently seen 
in USA AIDS-KS cases whereas B subtypes predominated in African KS cases or people of 
African heritage and C subtypes were mostly found in Classic, Posttransplant and AIDS-KS 
cases from the Middle East and Asia. A rare D subtype was identified in patients of Pacific 
Island origin. This study states that if cospeciation of virus and host is assumed then the 
geographic distribution of KSHV may be the result of isolation and founder effects 
associated with the migration of human populations out of Africa over the past 35000-60000 
years (Zong et al., 1999).
<P>
Similar results were obtained by another study that determined complete (n=23) or near 
complete (n=25) ORFK1 sequences from 58 tumor and peripheral blood samples from patients 
with Classic KS, Posttransplant KS, AIDS-KS, lymphoproliferative disorders and asymptomatic 
KSHV infection (Cook et al., 1999). Pair-wise comparisons of ORFK1 amino acid sequences from 
these samples varied from 0.4 to 44%. Phylogenetic analysis of 52 ORFK1 DNA and protein 
sequences (aa28-243) using distance, parsimony and maximum likelihood methods also 
distinguished A, B and C subtypes with the lowest bootstrap value of 87%. No samples from 
the proposed subtype D region were analysed in this study. Most of the amino acid 
differences were seen between amino acids 53-95 and 149-240, which overlaps with the 
aforementioned hypervariable regions. Less variability is seen in the transmembrane and 
cytoplasmic domains, and the tyrosine residues of the ITAM motifs (Y-SL, YTQP) were 
invariant. This study narrows the definition of subtype variant however subtype B 
predominated in Africa while subtypes A and C were found more frequently in Europe. No 
correlation was noted between subtype and more aggressive KSHV-related disease or geographic 
regions (Cook et al., 1999). Both studies have noted a high degree of non-synonymous amino 
acid changes in the K1 gene although whether this is confined to the hypervariable regions 
or the entire gene requires further evaluation. In either case this finding suggests that 
ORFK1 is under a selective pressure in comparison to the rest of the KSHV genome (Cook et 
al., 1999; Zong et al., 1999).  Further evidence of strain variability has been provided and 
it has been noted that strains do not always correspond to the geographic origin of the 
sample (Meng et al., 1999; Fouchard et al., 2000).  The functions of ORFK1 and the 
significance of the variation are discussed below.
<P>
<b>Some KSHV strains may have undergone recombination with a related gammaherpesvirus.</b>
<P>
Two highly divergent versions of the Aright@ end of the KSHV genome between ORF75 and the 
terminal repeat regions have been noted (Glenn et al., 1999; Poole et al., 1999). Unlike 
ORFK1 these two variants do not appear to be under evolutionary pressure and may have arisen 
as a result of recombination with a related gammaherpesvirus (Glenn et al., Poole et al., 
1999). Furthermore, additional recombination events involving KSHV strains have been noted 
throughout the viral genome (Poole et al., 1999). It should also be noted that, as is the 
case of the EBNA-1 protein of EBV, length variations of the LANA/ORF73 internal repeat 
region exist in different viral strains but geographic links of this length polymorphism 
have not yet been established (Rainbow et al., 1997; Gao et al., 1999). 
<P>
<b><font size=+2>Detection of KSHV and seroepidemiology</font></b>
<P>
Following the discovery of KSHV (Chang et al., 1994), seroepidemiologic and nucleic 
acid-based assays were designed to study the geographic distribution of KSHV.
<P>
<b>Serological and nucleic-acid based assays for KSHV detection</b>
<P>
<i><b>Serological assays</b></i> 
The demonstration of KSHV sequences in all forms of KS implies that antibodies to KSHV 
should be detectable in sera at the time of KS diagnosis and thereby serve as positive 
reference material (Olsen and Moore, 1998). Currently negative reference sera are chosen 
from a population that is at low risk for developing KS. Sensitivity and specificity data 
for assays can be calculated from these references and it is acknowledged that a low 
proportion of the negative group may have positive test results.  
<P>
<i><b>Latent antigens</b></i>
Antibodies to a high molecular weight (224-234kDa) latent nuclear antigen (LNA or LANA) can 
be detected by Western Blot (WB) or immunofluoresence assays (IFA) on B cell lines that were 
established from patients with BCBL/PEL with latent KSHV infection (Gao et al., 1996a,b; 
Kedes et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 1996). LANA has been shown to be encoded by ORF73 
following expression of this gene in bacterial and mammalian expression systems and 
subsequent demonstration of the 222-234kDa doublet by WB of the nuclear extract (Kedes et 
al., 1997b; Kellam et al., 1997; Rainbow et al., 1997). 
<P>
Using AIDS-KS and Classic KS sera as positive reference material and blood donor sera  from 
low prevalence countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom as a negative 
reference, both LANA WB and IFA formats have high sensitivity and specificity; KSHV 
antibodies are detected in 71-100% of AIDS-KS and Classic KS sera but only in 0-4% of blood 
donors (Gao et al., 1996a,b; Kedes et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 1996).
<P>
<i><b>Lytic antigens</i></b>
Lytic antigens have been identified to increase the sensitivity of KSHV immunoassays in 
order to estimate more accurately the prevalence of KSHV within populations and to avoid the 
problem that people may seroconvert to different antigens at different stages of KSHV 
infection (Goudsmit et al., 2000). Antibodies to lytic KSHV antigens can be detected by IFA 
on PEL cell lines that have been pre-treated with phorbol esters or sodium butyrate (Lenette 
et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1996,1997; Smith et al., 1997). Lytic antigens can be detected 
by WB or radioimmunoprecipitation of chemically induced BCBL-1 cell lines and also by whole 
virus enzyme-linked immunoassay as KSHV virions can be produced from the same cells by 
adding 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (Miller et al., 1996, 1997; Smith et al., 1997; 
Chandran et al., 1998a; Chatlynne et al., 1998). Recombinant structural antigens such as a 
capsid-related protein (ORF65) and membrane glycoprotein gp35-37 (ORFK8.1) are also useful 
for seroepidemiological purposes (Simpson et al., 1996; Chandran 1998a,b; Raab et al., 1998; 
Lang et al., 1999). Less discriminating antigens are not discussed here. 
<P>
The reported sensitivity and specificity values for assays detecting antibodies to lytic 
antigens vary in different studies. Generally, however, lytic IFAs have a sensitivity close 
to 100% (Lennette et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1997; Chandran et al., 1998a,b; Rabkin et al., 
1998) Different rates of antibody detection in US blood donors reported with this assay 
suggest that this specificity may vary in different laboratories (Lennette et al., 1996; 
Smith et al., 1997; Chandran et al., 1998a,b). Recombinant ORF65 proteins and gp35-37/K8.1 
give sensitivities in the range of 75-85%, with some variability if different expression 
vectors or purifucation methods are used (Simpson et al., 1996; Chandran et al., 1998a,b; 
Raab et al., 1998; Lang et al., 1999). The specificity of recombinant ORF65 and K8.1 based 
assays is generally higher than 80% and may approach 90% depending on the assay conditions 
used (Simpson et al., 1996; Chandran et al., 1998a,b; Raab et al., 1998; Lang et al., 1999)
<P>
A Western Blot assay using recombinant ORF73, ORF65 and ORFK8.1A and B proteins detects 89% 
of HIV-infected individuals with KS and 7% of HIV-uninfected individuals without KS (Zhu et 
al., 1999). Although these assays are suitable for seroepidemiology, they are not optimised 
for diagnostic use. One of the challenges of this field is to produce a standardised assay 
with optimal sensitivity and specificity using a combination of antigens.
<P>
<i><b>PCR based studies</i></b>
The earliest study to detect KSHV by nested PCR in peripheral blood showed that 52% of 
patients with AIDS-KS were positive (Whitby et al., 1995). Similarly KSHV DNA was detected 
in 14-20% of semen samples from patients with AIDS-KS (Gupta et al., 1996; Howard et al., 
1997). As all KS biopsies are infected with KSHV (Olsen and Moore, 1998), it seems that 
nested PCR is not sensitive enough for more accurate determination of KSHV prevalence. In 
addition, a study on KSHV sequences in biopsies and cultured spindle cells of Epidemic, 
Iatrogenic and Classic KS suggests that the rate of KSHV detection by PCR may also be 
dependent on the extent of clinical disease (Aluigi et al., 1996). Viral DNA sequences in 
PBMCs from patients with Classic KS were detected  in 17/23 (74%) cases of disseminated KS 
in comparison with 7/17 (41%) indolent KS cases suggesting again that the extent of clinical 
disease is important (Brambilla et al., 1996). Similar results were found in PBMCs of 
patients with 13/16 (81%) of active but only 2/10 (20%) of remitted AIDS-KS (Poggi et al., 
1997). Semiquantitative analysis of Southern blots showed higher levels of KSHV DNA in those 
patients with multicentric and visceral involvement than in localized disease (Mendez et 
al., 1998). Despite these caveats, PCR studies have been invaluable in our understanding of 
the geographic and population distributions of KSHV, association of KSHV with disease, 
transmission of KSHV and the natural history of KSHV infection and are discussed alongside 
the seroepidemiology results in this review. 
<P>
<b>Geographic distribution of KSHV</b>
<P>
<i><b>Seroprevalence of KSHV</i></b>
Although there are a variety of KSHV serological tests, it is possible to demonstrate that 
certain geographic regions have comparatively high or low KSHV seroprevalences (reviewed in 
Schulz, 1999).
<P>
In Northern Europe, KSHV appears to be rare among the general population. KSHV antibodies to 
both LANA and ORF65 are detected in less than 3% of United Kingdom blood donors and Danish 
railway workers (Simpson et al., 1996; Melbye et al., 1998). Similarly KSHV antibodies to 
LANA and ORF65 are found in 7% of Swedish blood donors and by LANA alone in 3% of French 
myeloma/lymphoma patients (Marcelin et al., 1997; Enbom et al., manuscript in preparation). 
KSHV antibodies to ORF65 were only present in 1.3% of 534 Swedish women (Tedeschi et al., 
1999). KSHV seroprevalences rise dramatically in countries in Southern Europe. Twenty 
percent of control subjects in a case-control study for Classic KS in Greece had antibodies 
to LANA and/or ORF65 (Simpson et al., 1996). KSHV seroprevalence is 4% in Milan using latent 
(BCP-1) IFA and LANA WB (Gao et al., 1996b).In other regions of Italy up to 35% of blood 
donors are KSHV seropositive by LANA IFA and/or ORF65 EIA/WB and a marked regional variation 
has been noted (Calabro et al., 1998; Whitby et al., 1998). Five percent of Swiss blood 
donors had antibodies to ORF65 ELISA (Regamey et al., 1998a).
<P>
In North America, antibodies to ORF65 and/or LANA are detected in less than 5% of blood 
donors (Gao et al., 1996a,b; Kedes et al., 1996; Lennette et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 
1996). This range increases from 0-14% using a panel of aliquoted sera that were tested to 
study interlaboratory and interassay variation of seven immunofluorescence assays and ELISAs 
 (Rabkin et al., 1998). Anti-LANA antibodies were virtually undetectable (<1%) in other 
studies on US blood donors (Kedes et al., 1997b; Chatlynne et al., 1998; Chandran 1998b). 
Use of a lytic IFA to detect antibodies against an undefined antigen increases the 
seroprevalence of KSHV among US blood donors to 8-29% (Lennette et al., 1996; Chandran et 
al., 1998b; Rabkin et al., 1998). ORFK8.1 WB and whole virus ELISA detect similar 
proportions (8-11%) of  HIV negative men and blood donors (Chandran et al., 1998b; Chatlynne 
et al., 1998). In Central and South America, 7.4% of blood donors were seropositive to LANA 
IFA in Sao Paolo, Brazil (Caterino-de-Araujo et al., 1999). Only 9/250 (3.6%) blood donors 
were seropositive with the Whole Virus ELISA or lytic and latent IFA in Jamaica (Manns et 
al., 1998). In Honduras, 12% of HIV-uninfected men were positive by lytic IFA (Sosa et al., 
1998).
<P>
In Africa antibodies to LANA and ORF65 have been reported in 6-53% of tested samples such as 
HIV negative patients, antenatal mothers, hospitalized patients and unknown sources and 
regional variation is again noted (Lennette et al., 1996; Gao et al., 1996a,b; Simpson et 
al., 1996; Ariyoshi et al., 1998, Bestetti et al., 1998; Mayama et al., 1998; Olsen et al., 
1998; Wilkinson et al., 1998). In one study, KSHV seroprevalence ranges from 32% in Zimbabwe 
to 100% in the Ivory Coast using a lytic IFA (Lennette et al., 1996).
<P>
For the remainder of the world, use of the LANA IFA detected no KSHV antibodies to serum 
samples of unknown origin in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Haiti but 10-29% of the 
same sera were considered positive with a lytic IFA (Lennette et al., 1996). Thirteen 
percent of HIV negative women in Haiti had antibodies to LANA (Goedert et al., 1997). In 
Saudi Arabia 6/44 (7%) control sera were ORF65 EIA positive (Qunibi et al., 1998).
<P>
PCR studies have also shown that there is geographic variation in KSHV seroprevalence but 
lack of sensitivity makes it difficult to determine seroprevalence rates. Nonetheless KSHV 
DNA was not found in PBMCs in blood donors from the United Kingdom, United States, Spain or 
France (Collandre et al., 1995; Whitby et al., 1995; Heredia et al., 1996; Humphrey et al., 
1996; Marchioli et al., 1996) whereas it was found infrequently (8-11%) in some (Bigoni et 
al., 1996; Viviano et al., 1997) but not other studies using Italian people as control 
subjects (Luppi et al., 1996). KSHV DNA has also been detected in 10% of HIV negative 
antenatal mothers from The Gambia (Ariyoshi et al., 1998) and in 8% of febrile Zambian 
children (Kasolo et al., 1997).

<b>AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma</b>

<i><b>KSHV seroprevalence in risk groups for HIV-1 transmission</i></b>
The hypothesis that AIDS-KS may be caused by a KS agent implies that the distribution of the 
agent should parallel the distribution of Kaposi's sarcoma among HIV-1 transmission groups 
such that KSHV seroprevalence is higher among homosexual/men than all other HIV-1 
transmission groups (Beral et al., 1990). Prevalences are considered first in terms of 
serological results and second in terms of PCR findings. 
<P>
In the United States, antibodies to LANA have consistently been found to be more prevalent 
(22-35%) in HIV-infected homosexual men in comparison to other HIV transmission groups such 
as patients with haemophilia, transfusion recipients and injecting drug users (Gao et al., 
1996b: Kedes et al., 1996; Lennette et al., 1996). The gradient of KSHV seroprevalence was 
again seen in HIV transmission groups using a lytic IFA that detected antibodies in 100% of 
homosexual men compared to 23% of injecting drug users and 21% of women (Lennette et al., 
1996).
<P>
Similar distribution patterns of KSHV have been found in HIV transmission groups in Europe. 
In Denmark, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, KSHV antibodies to ORF65 and LANA are 
detected more frequently in homosexual men/bisexual men (30-39%) as opposed to <7% of those 
with haemophilia or injecting drug users (Simpson et al., 1996; Melbye et al., 1998;  
Renwick et al., 1998). The pattern of distribution holds true even in Italy where inspite of 
a higher seroprevalence in the general population, 62% of homosexual men have antibodies to 
LANA or ORF65 compared to 11% in intravenous drug users and 17% in heterosexuals (Calabro et 
al., 1998). This pattern is seen consistently in studies from Italy (Rezza et al., 1998).
<P>
KSHV is only rarely detected in homosexual men unless they have KS when using nested PCR to 
detect KSHV DNA in PBMCs. In the United Kingdom, 11/143 (7.6%) HIV-infected homosexual men 
without KS were KSHV positive versus 0/134 (0%) blood donors and 0/26 (0%) oncology patients 
(Whitby et al., 1995). Comparable results were reported on KSHV DNA in PBMCs in 3/23 (13%) 
homosexual men with AIDS but without KS and 0/19 (0%) AIDS patients with haemophilia in the 
United States (Moore et al., 1996b) and in 1/4 (25%) HIV-uninfected homosexual men and 0/20 
(0%) blood donors in France (Lebbe et al., 1997). Similar results were reported from France 
and Switzerland (Dupon et al., 1997; Quinlivan et al., 1997). The detection of KSHV by PCR 
is not useful for determining KSHV prevalence however the presence of this virus in other 
cells and body fluids is discussed below.
<P>
<i><b>Association of KSHV with AIDS-KS </i></b>
That KSHV is the causative agent of KS, among other diseases, is usefully considered in 
terms of criteria that describe a cause and effect relationship. Disease causation can be 
viewed in terms of the following features; (1) The prevalence of the disease should be 
higher in those exposed than not exposed to the proposed cause and conversely, exposure to 
this cause should be more common in those with the disease than those without the disease. 
In the same vein, the incidence of the disease should be higher in persons who are exposed 
than not exposed as shown in prospective studies. As the strength of association, as 
measured by an odds ratio or relative risk, between a causative agent and its disease is 
based on prevalence or incidence data in exposed and unexposed groups, the implication is 
that the stronger the association, the more likely that the relationship is causal (2) These 
associations should be observed at different places and times under varying circumstances 
(3) Exposure to the cause should precede the appearance of disease (4) In some instances, 
there should be a dose-response relationship between the severity of exposure and severity 
of outcome which in turn means that prevention or elimination of the risk factor or 
modification of the host response should produce identical trends in disease expression (5) 
The specificity of the relationship in that a single suspected cause produces a single 
effect provides weak supportive evidence for causation (6) Although not always necessary, 
additional support for a causal relationship comes from biological plausibility and the 
relationship should be consistent with the natural history of the disease  (7) Experimental 
evidence should support the association (Hill, 1965; Evans et al., 1978).
<P>
Studies that detect antibodies to LANA, ORF65 or vp40 using IFA, WB or EIA have all 
demonstrated high prevalences of KSHV antibodies in patients with AIDS-KS (range: 
51.6-87.3%) compared with HIV-infected controls without KS (range:12.9-43.7%). As a result 
significant odds ratios (range: 3.7-18.7) have been found for the presence of KSHV 
antibodies between these cases and controls (Gao et al., 1996a,b; Kedes et al., 1996; Miller 
et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 1996; Renwick et al., 1998). 
<P>
The detection of KSHV by PCR in PBMCs of AIDS-KS patients (range: 34.7-90.9%)  and 
HIV-infected controls (range 0-18.7%) has similarly demonstrated a strong association 
between KSHV infection and KS with odds ratios varying from 2.3-440.0 (Whitby et al., 1995; 
Moore et al., 1996b; Lefrere et al., 1996; Marchioli et al., 1996; Humphrey et al., 1996). 
This association remains strong even in a region of high KSHV seroprevalence in the general 
population such as The Gambia (Ariyoshi et al., 1998). A strong association was not detected 
in the minority of studies (Collandre et al., 1995; Decker et al., 1996). The important 
temporal association between risk factor and disease was also demonstrated by PCR prior to 
the use of more sensitive serological assays (Whitby et al., 1995). 
<P>
Based on the Hill criteria for disease causation, results from prospective cohort studies in 
differing locations have provided the most convincing arguments to date that KSHV is the 
causative agent of KS within HIV-1 infected individuals. Not only are the associations 
between KSHV and KS consistently strong but also KSHV antibodies are usually detected before 
the appearance of clinical KS lesions. This temporal relationship has been quantified in the 
San Francisco Men's Health Study, Amsterdam Cohort Studies and a cohort of Danish homosexual 
men among others (Gao et al., 1996a; Martin et al., 1998; Melbye et al., 1998; Renwick et 
al., 1998; O'Brien et al., 1999; Rezza et al., 1999). Fifty percent of HIV and KSHV 
coinfected individuals developed AIDS-KS within 5-10 years and a similar  result was seen in 
Italy and the United States where approximately one third of HIV-KSHV coinfected men 
developed KS within 10 years (Martin et al., 1998; O'Brien et al., 1999; Rezza et al., 
1999). Other data that are necessary to fulfil the Hill criteria are provided by the 
Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection. The incidence of  KSHV infection is highest 
among HIV-infected homosexual men (6.2/100 person-years) compared with HIV-uninfected 
homosexual men (2.6/100 person-years) and injecting drug users (0.7/100 person-years).  As 
KS cases were observed exclusively in HIV-infected homosexual men, KSHV incidence data 
parallels the distribution of KS in these cohorts. Statistical models have also proved 
invaluable in evaluating the risk that KSHV infection confers on developing KS; a 
time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model has shown that KSHV antibodies (HR=3.27: 
95%CI: 1.86-5.77) and declining CD4 counts (HR=0.59: 95%CI 0.51-0.68) are independent 
predictors of Kaposi's sarcoma in the context of HIV-1 infection. The timing of KSHVand HIV 
infections may be important as KSHV seroconversions that follow HIV-1 seroconversion appear 
to increase the risk for developing KS (HR=5.17: 95%CI 2.88-9.27) (Renwick et al., 1998).
<P>
<b>KSHV seroprevalence in risk populations and association with Classic KS  </b>
<P>
KSHV seroprevalences range from 94.4-100% among persons with Classic KS and from 3.7-19.1% 
for matched or blood donor controls and odds ratios, when calculable, range from 130-257 
(Gao et al., 1996b; Simpson et al., 1996; Calabro et al., 1998). Incidence rates for Classic 
KS have been estimated in Denmark, Italy, Greece, Sweeden, the United Kingdom and the United 
States (Geddes et al., 1994, 1995; Franceschi and Geddes, 1995).For the most part, these 
incidence rates of Classic KS  are paralleled by KSHV seroprevalences in blood donors from 
these countries, as determined by immunoassays performed by one research group to minimise 
interobserver and interassay variation. This is exemplified in that the 8-fold difference in 
annual incidence rates of Classic KS for British men over 60 years (0.42/100,000: 1971-80) 
and Italian men over 50 years of age (3.44/100,000: 1976-84) is mirrored by a similar 
difference in KSHV seroprevalence in Italian (24%) and British (3%) blood donors (Simpson et 
al., 1996; Calabro et al., 1998; Melbye et al., 1998; Rabkin et al., 1998; Enbom et al., 
2000; reviewed in Schulz, 1999). 
<P>
For countries such as Italy which have comparatively high incidence rates of classic KS in 
comparison to the rest of the world, these rates are higher in Southern Italy, Sicily and 
Sardinia than in central or Northern Italy (Geddes et al., 1994, 1995; Francheschi and 
Geddes, 1995). The seroprevalence of antibodies to LANA in blood donors are higher in 
Southern Italy (24.6%) than Northern Italy (7.3%), and the highest seroprevalence (35.0%) is 
seen in Sicily (Whitby et al., 1998). Regional variation has again been demonstrated with 
antibodies to ORF65 and LANA in Italian blood donors with the highest seroprevalence (32%) 
in Sardinia (Calabro et al., 1998). Twenty five of one hundred (25%) sera obtained from 
pregnant women in Sardinia were KSHV seropositive by lytic IFA (Serraino et al., 1998) and 
high titers of anti-lytic and anti-latent antigens were found in KS patients in comparison 
to 50 HIV seronegative patients without KS (Cattani et al., 1999). Prospective cohorts are 
available for studying the relationship between KSHV and Classic KS.
<P>
<b>KSHV seroprevalence in risk populations and association with Posttransplant KS</b>
<P>
KS is also associated with receiving an organ transplant (Harwood et al., 1979; Penn, 1979). 
Case-control studies from different geographic regions have again demonstrated a strong 
association between KSHV antibodies and Posttransplant KS. In Italy, 10/11 (91%) of  
transplantation recipients with KS were seropositive to antibodies to LANA and ORF65 prior 
to transplantation compared to 2/17 (11.7%) organ recipients who served as controls (OR=75; 
95%CI: 4.7-3500) (Parravicini et al., 1997b). In Saudi Arabia, where KS is the commonest 
tumor to follow organ transplantation, 13/14 (92.9%) renal transplant recipients with KS 
were positive to p40 and sVCA immunoblot assays compared to 5/18 (27.7%) (p<0.001) renal 
transplant recipients without KS (Qunibi et al., 1998). In France, 17/25 (68%) of transplant 
recipients with antibodies to KSHV LANA or ORF65 pre- or post-transplantation developed KS 
compared to 1/33 (3%) KSHV seronegative transplant recipients (p<0.00001) (Farge et al., 
1999). Independent risk factors for KS in this transplantation population included origin in 
Africa or the Middle East, use of antilymphocyte sera for induction and KSHV antibodies 
(OR=28.4; 95%CI: 4.9-279) (Farge et al., 1999). In a separate study from France 16/166 
(9.6%) transplant recipients were KSHV seropositive with LANA IFA (Frances et al., 1999). 
Twelve of these sixteen (75%) of the KSHV seropositive patients survived past the first year 
and three patients developed Posttransplant KS wheres no such disease occured in the 150 
KSHV seronegative patients. In Switzerland, KSHV seroprevalence in 220 recipients of renal 
transplants increased from 14/220 (6.4%) at the time of transplantation to 39/220 (17.7%) 
after one year of follow-up using ORF65 ELISA (Regamey et al., 1998b). Two of the twenty 
five KSHV seroconverters in this study developed Posttransplant KS.
<P>
<b>KSHV seroprevalence in risk populations and association with African KS</b>
<P>
Data on HIV negative KS patients in Africa are scarce. One patient was positive by LANA IFA 
and Western Blot in Uganda (Gao et al., 1996b) and 28/28 (100%) serum samples from patients 
with Endemic/African KS were positive with both lytic and latent IFAs (Lennette et al., 
1996).
<P>
<b>The existence of a cofactor(s)</b>
<P>
Despite high prevalences (13.8-24.1%) of KSHV in blood donors from Italy, population-based 
incidence rates of Classic KS are low at 0.7-3/100000. The predilection of KS for males does 
not seem to be explained by higher KSHV seroprevalences in men which at best are three fold 
higher than women in some but not all studies (Calabro et al., 1998; Whitby et al., 1998; 
Angeloni et al., 1998). Similarly Endemic KS is more common in Central Africa and East 
Africa than in the rest of the continent, however KSHV seroprevalences are similar in West 
Africa and South Africa (Ariyoshi et al., 1998; Wilkinson et al., 1998) than in East Africa 
(Lennette et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 1996; Mayama et al., 1998). In a study of 16 KS 
patients from West Africa where there are comparable amount of HIV-1 and HIV-2, 14 patients 
had HIV-1, 1 patient had HIV-2 and 1 patient was coinfected by HIV-1 and HIV-2 (Ariyoshi et 
al., 1998). This study suggests that HIV-1 is a more effective co-factor than HIV-2 even 
when adjusted for CD4 count and that the role of HIV infection is not solely 
immunosuppression. Another unexplained aspect of KSHV epidemiology is that KS is as common 
as an AIDS-defining illness in HIV-infected drug users, patients with haemophilia and 
heterosexually transmitted women in KSHV endemic countries and countries where KSHV 
infection is rare suggesting that mode of transmission or the timing of infection plays a 
critical role (Casabona et al., 1991). It is also possible that a more virulent strain of 
KSHV or co-factor is an important determinant of disease expression.  
<P>
<font size=+2><b>Transmission of KSHV</b></font>
<P>
<b>Sexual transmission</b>
<P>
Although the epidemiology of AIDS-KS suggests that KSHV is transmitted preferentially but 
not exclusively among HIV transmission groups, more formal evidence has been acquired using 
seroepidemiological results from several cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies on 
homosexual men. 
<P>
In a cohort of Danish homosexual males, the presence of antibodies to KSHV LANA and ORF65 
was independently associated by multivariate analysis with the number of receptive anal 
intercourses (OR=2.83; p=0.03) and sex with men from the United States (OR=2.27; p<0.05). 
Multivariate analysis of KSHV seroconversion over the follow up period to 1996 showed that 
KSHV seroconversion was independently associated with visits to homosexual communities in 
the United States (RR=2.1; p=0.03) and also HIV positive status (RR=2.0, p=0.03). A decline 
in KSHV incidence in the early 1980s was attributed to changes in lifestyle (Melbye et al., 
1998).
<P>
Among participants and controls from the San Francisco Men's Health Study, no anti-LANA 
antibodies were detected among exclusively heterosexual men whereas KSHV seroprevalence was 
12.5% among men who reported mostly homosexual activity and 39.6% among exclusively 
homosexual men (Martin et al., 1998). KSHV seropositivity was also strongly associated with 
base-line HIV infection (p<0.001). In addition the prevalence of KSHV increased linearly 
with the number of male intercourse partners in the preceding two years, the relative 
prevalences of KSHV were significantly raised among persons with a self-reported history of 
sexually transmitted disease and the highest prevalence of KSHV was found among men with 
more than five years of regular homosexual intercourse (Martin et al., 1998). In the 
Amsterdam Cohort Studies (1984-1996) risk factors were examined for those who were KSHV 
positive at enrolment and also for those who seroconverted during the course of the study. 
The independent risk factors that were associated with KSHV seroconversion include 
oro-genital insertive oro-genital sex (OR 5.95; 95%CI: 2.88-12.29) or oro-genital receptive 
sex (OR 4.29; 2.11-8.71) with more than five partners in the past six months, older age (OR 
2.89; 1.13-7.34 when older than 45 years) and preceding HIV infection (OR: 2.47; 1.53-3.99)  
(Dukers et al., 2000).
<P>
In the Sydney HIV cohort, HIV-1 infected homosexual men with KSHV antibodies determined by 
ORF65 WB and LANA were more likely to report more casual sexual partners and insertive 
oroanal contact with casual partners although these findings were not statistically 
significant (Grulich et al., 1999). Other recent evidence is provided from the San Francisco 
Young Mens Health Study in which 39/79 (48.1%) young homosexual men were seropositive and 
this was linked to the number of male sex partners (Blackbourn et al., 1999). Sera from 2718 
patients in a London sexually transmitted disease clinic were tested with latent IFA and 
198/2718 (7.3%) were positive with independent risk factors being  homo- and bisexuality, 
birth in Africa, a history of syphilis, HSV-2 and HIV-infection (Smith et al., 1999). There 
was also no evidence in this study for sexual transmission among heterosexuals. KSHV 
antibodies were again noted to be more common in HIV-positive homosexual men (Verbeek et 
al., 1998).
<P>
There is considerable disagreement between studies on the precise mode of KSHV transmission 
between homosexual men however the mode of transmission must be either exclusively or a 
combination of oro-genital, oro-anal, oro-oral or ano-genital insertive or receptive sex. 
The importance of the oral cavity as a reservoir of KSHV infection is seen in the following 
studies; KSHV has been detected in saliva by PCR or culture in HIV-1 infected persons with 
or without KS and in one HIV-negative individual with KS  (Whitby et al., 1995; Vieira et 
al., 1997; Koelle et al., 1997). KSHV DNA sequences were found in 25/76 (32.9%) DNA samples 
extracted from saliva of HIV-infected patients but in 0/39 (0%) HIV-negative patients 
(Boldogh et al., 1996). KSHV is detected by nested PCR in 14/32 (43.8%), 11/24 (45.8%) and 
2/24 (0.08%) of throat swab, saliva and urine samples respectively for KS patients but in 
almost no controls (Cattani et al., 1999). Ten of fourteen (71.4%) of HIV-infected archived 
oral biopsy samples were KSHV PCR positive and 20 control samples were negative (Di Alberti 
et al., 1997a). Other studies have shown KSHV by PCR in saliva and nasal secretions of HIV-1 
infected individuals and KSHV seropositive persons but not in control subjects (Blackbourn 
et al., 1998; Lucht et al., 1998). Interestingly the number of HHV-8 copies per microgram of 
tissue or body fluid from KS patients was highest in PBMCs followed by saliva and semen and 
undetectable in faeces (La Duca et al., 1998). No KSHV sequences were detected by PCR on 
faeces from HIV-1 infected persons (Whitby et al., 1995). 
<P>
The varying proportions of KSHV in semen samples and prostate glands is contentious and may 
be subject to geographic variation for example Italy (reviewed in Blackbourn et al., 1997b). 
Since this review these findings have remained contentious. Most reports show that  KSHV DNA 
is absent in semen of  HIV-1 infected men without KS but found in 25-33% of individuals with 
AIDS-KS (Diamond et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1997). Another study has detected KSHV in a 
large proportion of HIV-1 infected men (Bobroski et al., 1998). There was no evidence for 
KSHV infection in healthy Danish semen donors or in prostatic tissue from HIV-negative 
adults (Rubin et al., 1998; Kelsen et al., 1999) however KSHV was found in prostatic tissue 
by PCR in 5 patients with past or current KS (Diamond et al., 1998). In samples from Central 
Africa, almost half (53%) of the HIV-positive African patients with KS had detectable KSHV 
in their semen and in 13% of HIV-negative donors by nested PCR of ORF26 (Belec et al., 
1998). These differences are probably due to variations in the assay or reflect geographic 
and population differences; a recent multicenter study has shown that it is easy to 
contaminate the HHV8 PCR and in those that were not contaminated, KSHV DNA was detected in 
less than 8% of all HIV-infected and uninfected donors (Pellett et al., 1999). 
<P>
Only 13/387 (3.4%) women from the San Francisco bay area had KSHV antibodies to LANA IFA and 
12 of the KSHV seropositive were also HIV seropositive (Kedes et al., 1997a). In London, 
13/169 (18.3%) women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic were KSHV seropositive, 
and were more likely to be African than born elsewhere (Whitby et al., 1999). KSHV can be 
detected in cervicovaginal secretions in HIV-infected women (Calabro et al., 1999;Whitby et 
al., 1999). It is not clear why so few HIV-1 infected women get Kaposi's sarcoma. 
<P>
<b>Childhood transmission</b>
<P>
Transmission before puberty appears to be rare in the United States (Blauvelt et al., 1997) 
but does occur in countries where KSHV is more widespread;  6/40 (15%) Sardinian children 
were found to have antibodies to KSHV LANA and/or ORF65 (Calabro et al., 1998). Age 
distribution of KSHV antibodies using the same tests as above showed that the KSHV 
seroprevalence for adults was reached well before puberty in Ugandan children but also rare 
before the age of 2 (Mayama et al., 1998). Correlation with hepatitis B infection suggests 
that KSHV is transmitted horizontally in conditions of close contact and crowding (Mayama et 
al., 1998). Evidence for intrafamilial clustering has been seen in Italy (Angeloni et al., 
1998). In South Africa, KSHV infection was common among children below the age of puberty 
but increased above puberty (Wilkinson et al., 1998). 4/53 (8%) of  Zambian children 
admitted to hospital with a first febrile episode had detectable KSHV by PCR in their PBMCs 
(Kasolo et al., 1997)
<P>
In South Africa, seventeen (16%) of 107 healthy mothers (60 black, 24 white, 5 Asian and 18 
mixed race) and 9 (8%) of their 112 children were KSHV seropositive by  LANA IFA (Bourboulia 
et al., 1998). Eight of the nine (88%) seropositive children had a seropositive mother and 
this study concluded that children less than 10 were probably the result of mother-child 
transmission, although whether this occurred pre-, peri or post-partum is not yet known. A 
subsequent study showed that the probability of mother-to-child transmission increased with 
increasing maternal antibody titer (Sitas et al., 1999). In Zambia, 183 (48.4%) of 378 
pregnant women were KSHV seropositive and 5 children with KS all had KSHV seropositive 
mothers (He et al., 1998). A study of 215 Ugandan children showed that antibodies to ORF65 
and LANA were independently associated with Hepatitis B infection and adult seroprevalence 
rates were reached before puberty suggesting a horizontal route of transmission (Mayama et 
al., 1998). Similar results were found to latent and lytic antigens in Cameroon where 
beginning at 4 years of age there was a steady increase in seroprevalence from 27.5% to 39% 
in the 12-14-year age groups and 48% above 15 years suggesting that KSHV infection occurs 
during childhood in Africa (Gessain et al., 1999). In Egypt, the seroprevalence of antilytic 
antibodies exceeded 50% in children older than 6 years and the prevalence stabilised at ten 
years (Andreoni et al., 1999). In children less than 2 years, KSHV infection is however 
rare, even in endemic countries, arguing against transmission through breast milk (Goedert 
et al., 1997; Mayama et al., 1998; Gessain et al., 1999; Lyall et al 1999).
<P>
<b>Parenteral transmission</b>
<P>
The presence of KSHV antibodies prior to transplantation in 10/11 (91%) of transplant 
recipients in the Italian study and in all 5 Posttransplant KS patients for whom 
pretransplant sera were available in the French study suggests that KS is mainly due to 
reactivation of KSHV in regions of KSHV endemicity (Parravicini et al., 1997b; Farge et al., 
1999). A similar argument for KSHV reactivation was seen in France (Frances et al., 1999). 
In Switzerland, a non-endemic country, the appearance of IgM antibodies to ORF65 in 8/10 
(80%) renal transplant recipients within three months of transplantation suggests that KSHV 
is transmitted through renal allografts or blood transfusion (Regamey et al., 1998b). There 
is some evidence that KSHV reactivates quickly after transplantation and that increased HHV8 
DNA levels in PBLs is associated with KS development (Mendez et al., 1999). KS remission 
seems to coincide with reduction or cessation of immunosuppression (Moosa et al., 1998). 
<P>
The detection of KSHV by reverse-transcription PCR from KSHV negative CD19 cells that were 
inoculated with the filtered supernatant of  phorbol ester and interleukin-6 stimulated CD19 
cells from a KSHV seropositive North American blood donor implies that KSHV may be 
transmitted parenterally through blood transfusion (Blackbourn et al., 1997a). The frequency 
of this occurrence is questioned by finding no KSHV DNA by KS330233 PCR in 19 
multiply-transfused recipients (Lefrere et al., 1997). KSHV antibodies as detected by LANA 
IFA were found in 1/74 (1.3%) Romanian children who were HIV-1 positive as a result of 
parenteral transmission (Marcelin et al., 1998). A weak association between antibodies to 
ORF65 but not to LANA and a history of intravenous injections were found among African 
children younger than 12 years (Mayama et al., 1998). 
<P>
<b>KSHV and its association with diseases other than KS</b>
<P>
KSHV was detected by PCR  in 3 B-cell immunoblastic lymphomas from AIDS patients  (Chang et 
al., 1994).  Subsequent investigation for KSHV by PCR or Southern hybridisation of a panel 
of 193 DNA samples that were extracted from lymphomas from patients with (n=41) and without 
AIDS (n=151) showed that 8 positive samples all belonged to the body cavity based lymphomas 
(Cesarman et al., 1995a). This finding was confirmed and the tumor was termed primary 
effusion lymphoma (Cesarman et al., 1996; Nador et al., 1996). Cell lines such as BC-1, -2 
and -3 and BCP-1 that have been established from these lymphomas have been invaluable for 
seroepidemiological and pathogenetic studies on latent and lytic KSHV growth (Cesarman et 
al., 1995b; Arvanitakis et al., 1996; Boshoff et al., 1998; Renne et al., 1996).
<P>
Due to an epidemiologic association between Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD), an 
atypical lymphoproliferative disorder, and KS in AIDS patients, KSHV was investigated and 
detected in 14/14 (100%) cases of HIV-associated MCD and 7/17 (41.1%) HIV-negative MCD 
(Soulier et al., 1995). Constant detection of KSHV in these diseases is reasonable evidence 
of causation as they are too rare to be considered in terms of  the Hill criteria. 
Pathogenesis of these diseases is not discussed in this review. 
<P>
The KSHV literature is filled with reports on the association or lack of association between 
KSHV and an extensive list of dermatologic, haematologic, neurologic and oncologic disease, 
infectious disease syndromes and systemic disorders. The most controversial reports to date 
are those concerning sarcoidosis and multiple myeloma (Di Alberti et al., 1997b; Rettig et 
al., 1997). As this article is confined to Kaposi's sarcoma these disease associations are 
not discussed.

<b><font size=+2>The pathology of KS and the contribution of endogenous cytokines and KSHV-encoded  factors 
to the pathogenesis of KS</font></b>

<b>The pathology of KS</b>
<P>
The pathology of KS is similar for all four epidemiological variants. At a macroscopic 
level, KS lesions tend to progress through patch (macular), plaque and nodular stages. KS 
lesions are usually first observed on the skin and the histological events here described 
begin in the upper dermis. Patch lesions are characterised by perivascular infiltrates of 
lymphocytes and plasma cells and  irregular dilated lymphatic-like spaces lined by 
endothelial cells. The plaque stage is notable for more extensive infiltration of blood 
vessels through the dermis and the presence of short fascicles of spindle-shaped cells. In 
the nodular stage the dermis is replaced by sheets of  spindle cells with ovoid nuclei, 
which are seldom mitotic, and vascular spaces that give the lesion the appearance of a 
honeycomb. More aggressive lesions are characterised by more  mitotic events and cellular 
atypia (Calonje and Wilson-Jones, 1997). Although spindle cells appear to be the 
proliferative component of the KS lesion, there is considerable debate as to their origin 
and whether their proliferation represents a hyperplastic polyclonal process rather than a 
monoclonal malignancy. 
<P>
These doubts emerge from the following observations and studies. At a clinical level, 
examples of the natural history of KS include reports of lesions that have regressed 
following the administration of thalidomide for a concomitant disorder or antiretroviral 
therapy and this behaviour seems uncharacteristic for a  malignant process (Soler et al., 
1996; Blum et al., 1997; Lebbe et al., 1998; Wit et al., 1998). Cells that are present or 
derived from KS lesions express a host of endothelial, fibroblastic and smooth muscle 
surface antigens and argues that the lesions contain a heterogeneous rather than a 
homogeneous cell population (Regezi et al., 1993; Kaaya et al., 1995; Lebbe et al., 1997). 
Sometimes it is possible to establish immortalized cell lines from KS tissue, of which KS 
Y-1 can induce malignant tumors in immunodeficient mice (Siegal et al., 1990; 
Lunardi-Iskandar et al., 1995; Albini et al., 1997). Disagreement surrounds the issue of 
clonality of proliferating KS cells and therefore the classification of KS as a malignancy. 
As each somatic cell in women contains one maternal and one paternal X chromosome, 
clonality, as assessed by the methylation patterns of the X-linked androgen-receptor gene 
present in DNA from KS biopsies from women, show that KS can arise from different cells in 
the same patient and that evidence for polyclonality can be seen in nodular KS tissue 
although some late-stage KS tumors are monoclonal (Delabesse et al., 1997; Rabkin et al., 
1997; Gill et al., 1998). 
<P>
It is interesting to search for a disease with which to compare KS and its pathogenesis. It 
has been suggested that the extensive EBV replication that is observed in hairy leukoplakia 
is similar to KSHV replication in some KS tissues (Hendrier, 1999). Other researchers 
counter that lytic replication is seen only in the minority of KS lesions so that the 
analogy may be consistent with the polyclonal expansion of B cells by EBV in organ 
transplantation (Schulz and Moore, 1999). The electron microscopic and immunohistochemical 
bases for these analogies are discussed below.          .
<P>
<b>Immunohistochemistry of KS lesions; presence, location and expression of KSHV encoded genes 
in Kaposi's sarcoma</b>
<P>
KSHV DNA sequences have been demonstrated by in situ hybridisation and/or amplification in 
spindle cells and endothelial cells that line the vascular spaces of  patch, plaque and 
nodular KS lesions and are not present in normal endothelial cells (Boshoff et al., 1995; Li 
et al., 1996; Foreman et al., 1997; Kennedy et al., 1998). These viral sequences have also 
been detected in the following cells; B cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, monocytes, 
glandular epithelium from the prostate gland, non-neoplastic lymph nodes and normal 
gastrointestinal mucosa from HIV-infected individuals and circulating spindle cells 
(reviewed in Schulz, 1998; Flamand et al., 1996; Blasig et al., 1997; Sirianni et al., 
1997a,b; Kliche et al., 1998; Trovato et al., 1999).                                                                                                                            
<P>
The detection of circular KSHV genomes in non-stimulated BCBL cell lines is considered as 
evidence of persistent or latent KSHV infection (Decker et al., 1996). More formal studies 
on KSHV transcription have been performed on BC-1 cell lines and KSHV transcripts can be 
classified as either Class I, II or III depending on their production under standard growth 
conditions and inducibility with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) or latent, immediate 
early, early and late transcripts based on the time of their production pre- and 
post-treatment with sodium butyrate (Sarid et al., 1998; Sun et al., 1999). Interestingly 
for the pathogenesis of Posttransplant KS, the lytic cycle in KSHV can be activated by 
hydrocortisone (Hudnall et al., 1999). Class I transcripts are presumed to be latent due to 
their constitutive expression under standard growth conditions and lack of chemical 
inducibilty and include, to date, v-FLIP (ORFK13/ ORF71), v-cyclin (ORF72) and LANA (ORF73) 
whereas Class II transcripts such as nuclear transcipt 1 (nut-1/T1.1), vIL6 (ORFK2), vMIP-II 
(ORFK4), vMIP-I (ORFK6), vIRF (ORFK9) and T0.7 (ORFK12) are present constitutively and 
inducible with TPA and Class III transcripts such as ORF65, ORFK1 and vIL8R (ORF74) are only 
present following induction with TPA (Sarid et al., 1998). A second large study on KSHV 
viral transcription agrees with the designation of the latent transcipts, with the exception 
of v-cyclin (ORF72) which was not formally investigated (Sun et al., 1999). Time course 
studies of transcript production show that BC-1 cells post induction with sodium butyrate 
produce immediate early transcripts from Rta (ORF50), vIL-6 (ORFK2) and vMIP-II (ORFK4), 
early transcripts from vMIP-I (ORFK6), T0.7 (ORFK12), vBcl-2 (ORF16) and v-IL8R (ORF74) and 
late transcripts from vp19 (ORF65) (Sun et al., 1999). Several studies on the expression of 
individual genes have provided additional evidence to support the designation of the above 
transcripts as either lytic or latent (reviewed in Schulz, 1998; Davis et al., 1997; 
Horenstein et al., 1997; Reed et al., 1998; Sturzl et al., 1998, 1999). 
<P>
Circular episomes which are indicative of latent persistent herpesviral infection were 
detected in KS biopsies (Decker et al., 1996). Of the class I/latent/constitutive genes, as 
defined in the PEL cell lines (Sarid et al., 1998; Sun et al., 1999), ORF73/LANA and 
ORF72/v-cyclin are known to be expressed in KS spindle cells, either by in situ 
hybridisation, or immunohistochemistry, or both (Staskus et al., 1997; Sturzl et al., 1997, 
Davis et al., 1997; Rainbow et al., 1997, Dupin et al., 1999). These findings indicate 
latent persistence of KSHV in the majority of KS spindle cells. However, a proportion of KS 
spindle cells has been shown to express lytic cycle (immediate-early, early and late) genes 
(Blasig et al., 1997; Sturzl et al., 1998 ; Sun et al., 1999). In addition KSHV virions can 
also be detected by light and transmission electron microscopy in some KS lesions (Orenstein 
et al., 1997). The extent of lytic and latent gene expression in KS tissue and the tissue 
specific expression of genes will also help determine an analogy for the pathology of KS. In 
early KS lesions, KSHV is present in <10% of cells forming the ectatic vessels whereas it is 
present in >90% of spindle cells in nodular KS and colocalizes with VEGFR3 (Dupin et al., 
1999).
<P>                        
<b>Necessary conditions for KS development</b>
<P
Regardless of the insights that are provided by pathological analogy, it is possible to 
determine factors that are necessary for KS development. No one factor is sufficient to 
cause KS and this includes KSHV which is the unifying feature of all four KS variants. 
Results from a prospective cohort study have shown that a declining CD4+ cell count 
(immunosuppression) is also an independent predictor of KS development in the context of 
HIV-1 infection (Renwick et al., 1998). This study suggests that HIV-1 is a potent co-factor 
for KS development and is supported by experimental data, more specifically for AIDS-KS, in 
which the HIV-1 tat protein can induce dermal lesions resembling KS in transgenic mice and 
promotes the growth of KS spindle cells, induces adhesion of these cells and induces 
angiogenesis via the Flk-1/KDR receptor on vascular endothelial cells (Vogel et al., 1988; 
Ensoli et al., 1990; Barillari et al., 1993; Albini et al., 1996). HIV-1 tat also increases 
KSHV DNA in PBMC cultures (Harrington et al., 1997). Although iatrogenic immunosuppression 
is evident in cases of Posttransplant KS, immunosuppression and/or other co-factors remain 
to be identified in the other variants of KS.					
<P>
It is possible to study the actions of KSHV on microvascular endothelial cells in culture 
(Flore et al., 1998; Moses et al., 1999). Purified KSHV particles cause long term 
proliferation and survival of these microvascular endothelial cells and telomerase activity 
and anchorage independent growth is also observed (Flore et al., 1998). Interestingly in 
this study, KSHV was only present in a subset of cells and the survival of uninfected cells 
seems to be due to a paracrine mechanism, which is a recurrent theme in KS pathogenesis as 
discussed below. Predominantly latent infection, as determined by the expression of ORFK12 
and LANA/ORF73, was noted in an in vitro culture system using these cells and lytic 
infection, as determined by ORF59 and ORFK8.1 expression, was observed with a small 
perecentage of cells (Moses et al., 1999). KSHV infection of endothelial cells produces 
spindle-shape that resemble those in the KS lesion and show transformation characteristics 
such as loss of contact inhibition and acquisition of anchorage independent growth (Moses et 
al., 1999). 
<P>
It is also possible to culture and study spindle cells from KS lesions and the following 
experimental studies implicate the growth-dependence of KS-derived cells on cytokines and 
angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of this vascular tumor. It is possible to culture cells 
from KS lesions that produce factors which support their own growth and that of others such 
as fibroblasts and endothelial cells and injection of these cultured cells into nude mice 
produces vascular tumors composed of mouse cells that are similar to KS (Salahuddin et al., 
1988). These cells have been shown to grow in the presence of cytokines such as IL-1_,  
IL-6, Interferon-_, Oncostatin M and Tumor Necrosis Factor _ (Miles et al., 1990, 1992; Nair 
et al., 1992). In turn KS-derived cells in culture  produce a variety of cytokines namely; 
basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), IL-1_, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Ensoli et 
al., 1989; Miles et al., 1990; Bailer et al., 1995; Cornali et al., 1996). Reactivation and 
persistence of KSHV in B cells and monocytes is maintained by Th1 cytokines such as IFN-_ 
produced in KS (Monini et al., 1999). In addition, the synergistic effects of HIV-1 Tat and 
bFGF promote angiogenesis in nude mice and cell lines from AIDS-KS lesions express high 
levels of both VEGF and VEGF receptors (Ensoli et al., 1994; Masood et al., 1997).
<P>
Although the remainder of this review focuses on the role of KSHV in KS pathogenesis, it is 
important to emphasize the considerable evidence that implicates host-derived cytokines and 
angiogenic factors in this process. Future reviews on KS tumorigenesis are likely to pursue 
this theme of a complex interplay between KSHV-, co-factor- and host encoded- factors.
<P>
<b><font size=+2>The function of select KSHV proteins</font></b>
<P>
These proteins will be discussed using the classification proposed by Sarid et al. and genes 
that encode viral structural and assembly proteins are not discussed.      
<P>
<b><font size=+2>Proteins that are translated from Class I transcripts</font></b>
<P>
All 3 of these mRNAs are expressed in BCBL-1 cells prior to lytic induction and are also 
detectable in >70% of KS spindle cells in primary KS tumors (Dittmer et al., 1998).
<P>
<b>v-FLIP (ORFK13/ORF71)</b>
<P>
The dual ORF assignment represents a historic disagreement over whether this gene was unique 
to KSHV or conserved among herpesviruses (Russo et al., 1996; Neipel et al., 1997b,c; Thome 
et al., 1997). ORFK13/ORF71 belongs to a group of genes which encode a FLICE protease 
inhibitory protein (v-FLIP) and cells that express v-FLIP are protected against apoptosis 
induced by the CD95 death receptor (Thome et al., 1997). Viral FLIP inhibits caspase 
activation and thereby prevents cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis and inoculation of v-FLIP 
transduced murine B lymphoma cells into immunocompetent mice led to aggressive tumor 
formation with a high rate of survival and growth (Djerbi et al., 1999). In this study, 
v-FLIP was considered a tumor progression factor.  This protein may have a dual role in 
anti-apoptosis and tumor progression.  
<P>
<b>v-cyclin (ORF72)</b>
<P>
The association of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) leads to the formation of an 
active holoenzyme that can phosphorylate many target molecules that are involved in the 
regulation of the cell replicative cycle (reviewed in Cannell and Mittnacht, 1999). KSHV 
v-cyclin stimulates cdk6 to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein and H1 histones (Chang 
et al., 1996; Li et al., 1997; Godden-Kent et al., 1997; Swanton et al., 1997). The 
v-cyclin/cdk6 holoenzyme is not inhibited by CDK inhibitors such as p16Ink4a, p21Cip1 and 
p27Kip1 and the holoenzyme stimulates the progression from G1 to S in quiescent fibroblasts 
(Swanton et al., 1997). In addition the holoenzyme can phosphorylate the p27Kip1 inhibitor 
which subsequently degrades and can also bypass p27Kip1-imposed G1 arrest (Ellis et al., 
1999; Mann et al., 1999). V-cyclin appears to trigger apoptosis after the S phase in the 
presence of cdk6 but this phenomenon can be blocked by the activity of vBcl-2 (Ojala et al., 
1999). V-cyclin can also activate transcription of human cyclin gene A in quiescent cells 
(Duro et al., 1999). All these studies implicate KSHV v-cyclin in cellular dysregulation and 
this protein may play a role in the proliferative component of the KS lesion.  
<P>
<b>LANA (ORF73)</b>
<P>
Antibodies against LANA have also been used to demonstrate extensive expression of this 
protein in KS spindle cells (Rainbow et al., 1997; Katano et al., 1999; Kellam et al., 
1999). LANA colocalizes with the viral episome in interphase nuclei and along mitotic 
chromosomes suggesting that LANA may be involved in episome maintenance during cell division 
(Ballestas et al., 1999). LANA has also been shown to be associated with nuclear 
heterochromatin (Szekely et al., 1998) and to bind to RING3, a member of the homeotic gene 
family fsh, an interaction that appears to mediate its phosphorylation (Platt et al., 1999).
<P>
<b><font size=+2>Proteins that are translated from Class II transcripts</font></b>
<P>
<b>vIL-6 (ORFK2)</b>
<P>
The importance of cytokines such as IL-6 in KS pathogenesis has already been discussed. KSHV 
ORFK2 encodes an IL-6 molecule with a low degree of amino acid homology (24.8%) to human 
IL-6 (Moore et al., 1996a; Neipel et al., 1997a; Nicholas et al., 1997). This viral cytokine 
is expressed by PEL cells and CD20+ B cells in lymphoid tissue from KSHV infected patients 
but not KS tissue and suggests that vIL-6 may contribute to haematopoietic rather than 
endothelial cell proliferation (Moore et al., 1996c). This study mooted the idea of tissue 
specific expression of KSHV genes in KSHV-related pathology. 
<P>
Viral IL-6 is functional and can maintain the proliferation of IL-6 dependent mouse and 
human cell lines (Moore et al., 1996c; Nicholas et al., 1997; Burger et al., 1998). This 
cytokine activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway via interaction with the gp130 subunit 
independent of the IL-6R alpha chain (Molden et al., 1997; Burger et al., 1998; Wan et al., 
1999). Viral IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that promotes haematopoiesis, plasmacytosis 
and angiogenesis (Aoki et al., 1999). Variation in vIL-6 expression between KSHV associated 
diseases such as PEL, MCD and KS has been noted (Cannon et al., 1999). These results partly 
agree with another study that had found vIL-6 transcripts in 6/6 KSHV positive, HIV 
seronegative patients with MCD but in no patients with KS (Parravicini et al., 1997a). The 
average levels of vIL-6 RNA in infected cells from PEL and MCD were an order of magnitude 
higher than those from KS, arguing again for varying expression of genes in KSHV-related 
pathologies (Staskus et al., 1999)
<P>
<b>vMIP-I, vMIP-II and vBck (ORFs K4, K6 and K4.1)</b>
<P>
ORFs K4 and K6 encode chemokines that contain a C-C dicysteine dimer (Moore et al., 1996a; 
Russo et al., 1996; Neipel et al., 1997a; Nicholas et al., 1997). ORFK6 encodes vMIP-I and 
this chemokine blocks entry of CCR5 dependent primary HIV-1 strains by interacting with the 
CCR5 receptor (Moore et al., 1996c). vMIP-I also seems to be an agonist of the CCR8 
co-receptor (Dairaghi et al., 1999; Endres et al., 1999). ORFK4 encodes vMIP-II and this 
chemokine blocks HIV-1 infection of CD4+ cells that express CCR3 (Boshoff et al., 1997). 
There is evidence that vMIP-II blocks HIV-1 entry through CCR3, CCR5, CX3CR1 and CXCR4 
receptors and that vMIP-II can block HIV-1 entry into microglia in culture (Chen et al., 
1988; Kledal et al., 1997; Hibbitts et al., 1999). These viral chemokines have other 
functions; vMIP-II is chemoattractive for eosinophils and Th2 cells and both vMIPs I and II 
are highly angiogenic in the chorioallantoic assay (Boshoff et al., 1997; Sozzani et al., 
1998). Whether vMIP-II has agonist or antagonist activity on the CCR8 co-receptor remains to 
be settled (Sozzani et al., 1998; Dairaghi et al., 1999). ORFK4.1 encodes a viral chemokine, 
vBck, which is related to human MIP-1 beta and the macrophage chemoattractant protein 
although no functional data is yet available (Neipel et al., 1997b,c).
<P>
<b>T1.1/ nut-1 RNA (ORFK7)</b>
<P>
KSHV infected cells produce a 1.1 kb transcript termed T1.1/nut-1RNA that accumulates in the 
cell nucleus and is not translated into protein (Sun et al., 1996; Zhong et al., 1996). 
T1.1/nut-1 RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II, has a poly-A tail but does not have a 
trimethylguanosine cap (Sun et al., 1996; Zhong and Ganem, 1997). These studies suggest that 
this RNA is associated with ribonucleoprotein complexes and may be involved in the control 
of either viral or cellular transcript splicing.
<P>
<b>vBcl-2 (ORF16)</b>
<P>
Viral Bcl-2 shares a low degree of amino acid homology (15-20%) with human cellular homologs 
(Russo et al., 1996; Neipel et al., 1997b,c; Cheng et al., 1997;  Sarid et al., 1997). 
Functional studies suggest that vBcl-2 inhibits apoptosis in yeast or Sindbis virus-infected 
cells although these studies disagree on the ability of vBcl-2 to form a dimer protein with 
human Bcl-2 (Cheng et al., 1997; Sarid et al., 1997). Overexpression of vBcl-2 delayed the 
process of apoptosis in 293 cells and an anti-apoptotic role in pathogenesis is postulated 
(Friborg et al., 1998). 	
<P>
<b>ORF50 and ORFK8</b>
<P>
The protein that is encoded by ORF50 is similar to the EBV lytic switch BRLF1 protein which 
belongs to the herpesvirus family of R transactivators (Rta) and it activates lytic KSHV 
replication (Russo et al., 1996; Lukac et al., 1998; Sun et al., 1998). The ORF50 transcript 
is classified as Class II/III or as an immediate early gene and also encodes ORFK8 (Sarid et 
al., 1998; Zhu et al., 1999; Seaman et al., 1999). The C-terminal region of ORF50 strongly 
activates transcription when targeted to DNA (Lukac et al., 1999). In this study ORF50 was 
considered a molecular switch as expression of an ORF50 protein that lacks the C-terminal 
region suppresses viral replication that should be induced by stimuli such as phorbol ester 
and sodium butyrate and also prevents spontaneous reactivation of KSHV from latency. Three 
percent of spindle-shaped cells in KS biopsies express Rta (Sun et al., 1999).
<P>
The major ORF50 transcript also encodes K8 and this protein resembles the ZEBRA/Zta/EB1 
trasncriptional activator protein of EBV (Gruffat et al., 1999; Seaman et al., 1999; Zhu et 
al., 1999). This protein is also expressed in 3% of spindle-shaped cells in KS biopsies as 
determined by in situ hybridisation (Sun et al., 1999).
<P>
<b>ORFK8.1</b>
<P>
ORFK8.1 is immunogenic, encodes the glycoprotein gp35-37 and splicing of the transcript 
yields ORFK8.1A and B proteins (Raab et al., 1998; Chandran et al., 1998a,b; Lang et al., 
1999; Zhu et al., 1999). Interestingly the antigens that are detected by lytic IFA are 
predominantly ORFK8.1 (Li et al., 1999). This study has shown by immunofluorescence and 
immunoelectron microscopy that ORFK8.1 appears to be acquired by the KSHV virion during 
budding and antibodies to this protein were detected in 18/20 (90%) patients with KS 
patients and in 0/10 (0%) patients without KS. Cytotoxic T-cell responses have been detected 
against ORFK8.1 and also ORFK1 and K12 (Osman et al., 1999).
<P>
<b>vIRF-1 (ORFK9) and vIRF-2 (unassigned ORF)</b>
<P>
Viral IRF-1 and-2 are encoded by ORFK9 and an unassigned ORF upstream from ORFK11 
respectively (Moore et al., 1996a; Burysek et al., 1999). Viral IRF-1 inhibits the 
interferon-beta signaling pathway in HeLa and 293 cells, can transform NIH3T3 cells and 
induce tumors when injected into nude mice (Gao et al., 1997). Viral IRF-1 again was noted 
to inhibit IFN-mediated signal transduction and cause morphological changes in NIH3T3 cells 
consistent with cellular transformation and similar inhibitory results to interferon stimuli 
were found in HUVEC cells (Li et al., 1998; Zimring et al., 1998). The inhibitory effects of 
vIRF-1 seem to be mediated by binding with cellular IRFs and p300 (Burysek et al., 1999a). 
Viral IRF-1 may also activate transcription (Roan et al., 1999). Viral IRF-2 also can bind 
specific cellular transcription factors (Burysek et al., 1999b). These studies provide 
evidence for viral regulation of cellular genes and there are two further vIRFs (ORFK10.1 
and ORFK11) to be studied.  
<P>
<b>T0.7 (ORFK12)</b>
<P>
T0.7 encodes a small protein termed Kaposin whose RNA is expressed in abundance in 
unstimulated BCBL-1 cells and is detectable in the majority of KS tumors of differing 
epidemiological variants (Zhong et al., 1996; Staskus et al., 1997). Expression of this 
protein in Rat-3 cells produces focal transformation and subcutaneous injection into nude 
mice produced highly vascular and undifferentiated sarcomas (Muralidhar et al., 1998). A 
recent report shows that the genomic region around ORFK12 region yields several transcripts 
and proteins for which the functions remain to be determined (Sadler et al., 1999).
<P>
<b>LAMP (ORFK15)</b>
<P>
There are two variants of the ORFK15 membrane protein with several src homology 2 (SH2)-like 
motifs and potential tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) binding sites 
in its cytoplasmic tail. This protein may combine features of LMP1 and LMP2A which are 
involved in cellular transformation and maintenance of viral latency in B cells respectively 
(Glenn et al., 1999; Poole et al., 1999). This protein localizes on the surface and 
intracellular membranes of 293 cells and interacts with TRAFs 1, 2 and 3. The detailed 
functions of this protein are yet to be defined (Glenn et al., 1999).
<P>
<b><font size=+2>Proteins that are translated from Class III transcripts</font></b>
<P>
<b>ORFK1</b>
<P>
The high degree of amino acid variation in ORFK1 has been discussed above and suggests that 
this transmembrane protein is under a selective pressure. Many clues to the importance and 
function of ORFK1 come from the transforming proteins of other gammaherpesviruses; ORFK1 is 
the positional analogue of saimiri transforming protein (STP) in HVS and the latent membrane 
protein 1 (LMP-1) of EBV (reviewed in Hayward, 1999). A role in cellular transformation is 
surmised following the demonstration that rodent fibroblasts that express ORK1 show evidence 
of transformation and that ORFK1 can replace the C-strain of STP in the HVS genome and 
induce lymphoma in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (Lee et al., 1998b). Mutational 
analysis of a chimaeric construct of human CD8_ polypeptide and the carboxy terminus of 
ORFK1 has demonstrated that the ITAM motif is functional and is required for signal 
transduction (Lee et al., 1998b). K1 multimerizes in the membrane and appears to transduce a 
signal in the absence of an exogenous cross-linking ligand (Lagunoff et al., 1999).  
<P>
<b>ORF74 (GPCR/v-IL8R) </b>
<P>
Viral GPCR can signal through the phosphoinositide-inositoltriphosphate-protein kinase C in 
the absence of an IL-8 agonist and also stimulates rat fibroblasts to proliferate 
(Arvanitakis et al., 1997). Expression of the G protein-coupled receptor in a 
focus-formation assay led to focal transformation of NIH3T3 cells and subsequent injection 
of neomycin-selected cells into nude mice caused tumors that consisted of spindle-shaped 
cells (Bais et al., 1998) In this study, media from KSHV-GPCR-expressing NIH3T3 cells but 
not controls stimulated growth of HUVECs and induced microtubule formation in the 
microtubule formation and co-culture matrigel assays and this process could be inhibited by 
anti-VEGF antibody. In addition, KSHV-GPCR activates two protein kinases, JNK/SAPK and 
p38MAPK, which are activated by inflammatory cytokines that are known to induce angiogenesis 
and stimulate VEGF production in KS spindle cells (Samaniego et al., 1994; Cornali et al., 
1996; Bais et al., 1998).Constitutive signaling from this receptor can be augmented by 
interleukin-8 and growth-related protein-_ and inhibited by human interferon-_-inducible 
protein, vMIP-II, stromal cell-derived factor 1-_ and GPCR-specific kinases (Geras-Raaka et 
al., 1998a,b,c; Gershengorn et al., 1998; Rosenkilde et al., 1999). Interestingly, the 
related human receptor, CXCR2, can transform NIH3T3 cells if the DRY sequence at positions 
138-140 is changed to the VRY sequence that is seen is KSHV GPCR (Burger et al., 1999). The 
amino terminus of GPCR is necessary for high affinity chemokine binding but not for 
constitutive activity (Ho et al., 1999). However v-GCR appears to be only expressed in a 
subpopulation of KS spindle cells, which presumably undergo lytic replication (Kirshner et 
al., 1999). It is encoded on a bicistronic mRNA downstream of ORFK14 and protein expression 
may require an unusual mechanism such as translational reinitiation, internal ribosome entry 
or leaky ribosomal scanning (Kirshner et al., 1999).
<P>
<b><font size=+2>Conclusion</font></b>
<P>
Several serological and nucleic acid based assays have been designed to detect KSHV and 
despite the limitations of imperfect reference standards and assay variability, it is 
possible to discern geographic regions and populations with comparatively high and low KSHV 
seroprevalences. Although KSHV DNA and/or antibodies are detected in the majority of 
patients and strongly associated with all epidemiological variants of KS, it is clear that 
most KSHV-infected individuals do not develop KS. A co-factor appears to be required for 
this vascular tumor to be expressed clinically; HIV-1 is a necessary condition for AIDS-KS 
development and the contributory roles of inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, 
HIV-induced immunosuppression and HIV-1 tat have been discussed. Immunosuppressive therapy 
plays a role in the development of Posttransplant KS, however the role of immunosuppression, 
immunoactivation and/or co-factors remain to be established for Classic and Endemic KS. 
Studies on KS pathogenesis need to consider both the host and the co-factor in addition to 
KSHV.
<P>
Seroepidemiological studies have provided useful data on KSHV transmission. There is general 
agreement that KSHV is sexually transmitted among homosexual men although the precise mode 
of transmission is still hotly contested. Regardless of this disagreement, the public health 
message to practise safe sex is clear. In endemic countries, transmission in childhood 
through close contact appears to be important. It is important to elucidate all modes of 
KSHV transmission as part of the drive to eliminate a preventible disease.  
<P>
KSHV is present in all KS tumors. Functional studies of individual KSHV-encoded proteins 
provide endless possibilities for the way that KSHV may cause KS; vIL6 is involved in cell 
proliferation, vMIP-I and -II are angiogenic, vBcl-2 could be anti-apoptotic, the interferon 
regulatory factors may downregulate the host response to interferon. Kaposin, ORFK1 and 
vIRF-1 may be transforming proteins and ORF74/GPCR has both angiogenic and transforming 
properties. Cellular defense mechanisms such as cell cycle shutdown and apoptosis may be 
prevented by vBcl-2, v-cyclin and vIL-6.
<P>
It is interesting that very few of these genes are expressed in the majority of KS spindle 
cells. Latent genes such as v-FLIP (anti-apoptosis), kaposin (cell transformation), LANA 
(episomal maintenance) and v-cyclin (cell proliferation) are expressed in most KS spindle 
cells indicating latent persistence of the virus. Expression of early/late lytic genes such 
as vGPCR in a few spindle cells may however contribute to pathogenesis e.g. by increasing 
the release of cellular growth factors such as VEGF. This may be explained that by the time 
KS is apparent, the destructive lytic cycle is no longer needed.
<P>
KSHV has been associated with a number of other diseases and these associations need to be 
explored. Little doubt remains around the relationship with Multicentric Castleman's Disease 
and Primary Effusion Lymphoma and these disease phenotypes may be dependent on tissue 
specific expression of KSHV genes. The availability of a cell culture system an/or an animal 
model will extend the studies that can be done on KS pathogenesis and also the evaluation of 
antiviral agents and pathogenesis-based therapies. The ultimate reward for studying a 
viral-induced tumor is that one day this disease should be eradicated.
