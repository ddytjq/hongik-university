Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos</a>, La Palma, Canary Islands, 
</center>

<p>
This spectacular site, on the northern rim of the Caldera de Taburiente at an 
altitude of about 2400 meters, has some of the best seeing I've ever measured. 
Astronomical development of the international observatory began in earnest with
the decision to relocate the Isaac Newton Telescope from Herstmonceux in Sussex 
(which had interesting mechanical effects on the mounting, since that entailed
a 25-degree latitude change). 
The William Herschel telescope combines the excellent site with very 
well-thought-out instrumentation for world-class results. I used these 
facilities several times while on a two-year stint at the Sterrewacht Leiden, 
since the Netherlands astronomical community contributes to the
support of the La Palma operation. And more recently, I've been able to use
the Nordic Optical Telescope for galaxy dynamics studies.

Peter Allan and I used the JKT to continue the quasar variability project that 
we started with the Kitt Peak 1.3-m telescope - this sort of thing can happen 
when both collaborators change continents. These data formed the basis
of a Master's thesis by Jose Maria Castro Ceron, which should be submitted
for journal publication any day now. We also used a CCD camera on the JKT for part 
of a study of H-alpha emitting regions in interacting galaxies.</p>
 
<p>The JKT lies closer to the rim of the Caldera de Taburiente than any of the
other telescopes. This means that observers might want to take a flashlight
along when walking uphill from teh dome at night. It's a long way down...</p>

   alt="Isaac Newton Telescope"></a>The Isaac Newton telescope has a very efficient and flexible spectrograph, very important when the UK and Dutch communities were using it to compete with 
4-meter telescopes elsewhere (a role now ably handled by the WHT). The superb seeing 
often encountered at La Palma made this an appealing setup for investigating 
galactic nuclei. I took a series of high-dispersion spectra to study composite 
nuclei, with signs of both star formation and nonstellar activity in close 
proximity. Among other things, these data furnished evidence of a 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1989AJ.....98..195K&db_key=AST&high=3650739d2a24761">
massive black hole</a> at the center of M81, as seen from the central rise 
of stellar 
velocity dispersion measured in subarcsecond seeing here. An INT spectrum
also furnished a <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996PASP..108..917K&db_key=AST&high=3650739d2a24761"> 
crucial clue</a> to interpreting IUE and HST observations of
the nucleus of NGC 4569, a spiral in the Virgo cluster whose core is so
small that it was once mistaken for a foreground star. The optical spectrum
showed absorption-line profiles inconsistent with the most obvious
explanation of its colors, and that the nucleus must be (for whatever reason)
loaded with A-type supergiant stars.</p>

One of the new generation of large altazimuth telescopes, the WHT started 
regular operation in 1987. Looking at the elevated walkways to the 
telescope platform, I couldn't help thinking, "Another fine product
of Krell technology". Our team got one of the earliest normally scheduled 
observing runs (almost canceled by brush fires). We used the Faint-Object 
Spectrograph (shown below attached to the WHT)
to observe faint candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected
from the deep fields observed by IRAS, parallel to its all-sky survey. We also 
sneaked in spectra of the different components of the Einstein Cross 2237+030. 
Here are some sample spectra of faint active galaxies as measured with the WHT.

<a href="notx.jpg"><img src="notxs.jpg" align=right
height=289 width=188"></a> The compact, altazimuth-mounted NOT has achieved excellent images,
not only through optical quality but due to its compact lightweight
dome and the practice of opening huge vents to allow wind to flow right
through the enclosure. The telescope is operated by institutions in 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. I've used it in a project 
with Gene Byrd and
Mauri Valtonen to seek faint, tidally stripped companions of nearby edge-on
galaxies, which would serve as tracers of the halo dynamics and history
of these systems. </p>

<p> The NOT dome turns as a unit with the telescope, allowing a very minimal
layout. It also means you should be very careful with walking in or out
of the dome at night...</p>

<p> Still to come: JKT data on QSOs and galaxy H-alpha image.
INT spectra of NGC 4569, M94, M81. WHT spectra of faint IRAS galaxies.
NOT color image of NGC 4244.</p>

<p> Other instruments are also sited at the Roque de los Muchachos. 
These include the <a href="http://www.tng.iac.es/">Telescopio Nazionale Galileo</a> and the Dutch Open
Telescope. Galileo is a 3.5-m near-duplicate of the ESO New Technology
Telescope (right down to the details of the enclosure).</p>

<p> The 
<a href="http://www.iac.es/gabinete/orm/dot.html">Dutch Open Telescope</a> 
is designed to improve image quality by
having the telescope open to the air as far as possible. It currently
hosts a 45-cm solar instrument, with the option of installing a primary
as large as 70 cm. Any resemblance to a Martian tripod machine 
<a href="http://www.literature.org/authors/wells-herbert-george/the-war-of-the-worlds/">
a la H.G. Wells</a> is completely coincidental.</p>

The La Palma site has also been used or high-energy gamma-ray astronomy
via the atmospheric Cerenkov technique, detecting the gamma rays when
they interact with atoms in the upper atmosphere to release showers
of high-energy articles, some of which are moving faster than the
speed of light <b>in the atmosphere</b> and in doing so release
very brief flashes of light in a conical pattern. This is the Cerenkov
effect, and I now know the conical pattern very well since it was
the major screwup on my grad-school oral exam... The instruments
for such work are large light buckets, where light grasp is important
and resolution isn't, so arrays of cheap mirrors are often used.
Here we see the sun setting on the original array in the late 1980s, which
has since been replaced by a more extensive and complex combination
of pointed Cerenkov detectors and all-sky particle monitors in a
fly's-eye arrangement. Alas, last time I saw that one in daylight it
was snowing too hard to get a decent picture.</p>
