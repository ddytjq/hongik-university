Seats are allocated in the lower tier or upper tier, or both if a large away support is requested. Beer is available (large bottles 
of carlsberg in plastic glasses) but the bar closes 15 minutes prior to kick off and doesn't open at half time. Smoking is allowed but there are requests not to smoke while
the match is in progress. Both flags and drums are allowed into the ground (though I would check with the club before taking a drum as we have previously
been informed that they are not allowed. There is no TV on the concourse but there are two
JumboTron screens, one built into the North Stand and the other built into the South Stand.
</P><P>The seats in the upper tier are on quite a step slope, but do give a pretty good view and the closed in corners of the ground lead to excellent accoustics. The concourse area
is the unpainted breeze block variety and toilets where a little on the short side.

look further away or drink in the ground. One option for visiting fans is The Park which is about 10 minutes walk away, we have been told that 
The Red Lion is the semi-offcial away pub, but we've as yet been unable to locate it.

Stand of White Hart Lane. Just follow Park Lane down and the pub is at the end. The Park is not an away pub and gets a lot of home fans in 
but is quite happy to accept away fans wearing colours for most games. There are 2 rooms and the back one has a large screen TV showing sky and well as several smaller TV's. There is no food available
on matchdays. The pub has a car park but we don't know what the policy is regarding parking for the game.
</P><P>There are no real ales and hard plastics glasses are used and bottles are not given out over the bar. The police usually pay a visit but generally the pub is friendly enough and popular
with families.

the most northerly point of the A406, near where it joins the A10). Exit
the A406 onto the A1010 (Upper Fore Street) toward Tottenham, after this
becomes High Road the ground should be on your left.

may end up with quite a walk. One option is to park at a tube/train
station further out of London and use local transport to get in. 
</P><P>There are several private car parks close to the ground though they aren't cheap. There are a couple of schools offering parking, one 200 metres 
away which costs £7.00 and another very large one 50 metres away costs £5.00. There are numerous private car parks with the one across the High Road costing £10.

or take an overland train to White Hart Lane Station. There are regular buses running up High Road to the ground.
</P><P>For those wishing to walk, turn left up Severn Sister Road towards
High Road. Turn turn left up High Road and the ground is about 1 1/2 miles
walk away.
</P><P>White Hart Lane Station is very close to the ground, simply walk down
White Hart Lane onto High Road.
</P><P>Another alternative is to get a tube to Northumberland St (direct from Liverpool St).
From Northumberland St. it is a 8/9 minute stroll along Park Lane direct to the away supporters entrance in South Stand.
