<H2><B>I. OVERVIEW</B></H2>

<P>Globally circulating strains of human immunodeficiency virus type
one (HIV-1) exhibit an extraordinary degree of genetic diversity,
which may influence aspects of their biology such as infectivity,
transmissibility and immunogenicity. Sequences derived from these
HIV-1 strains have historically been classified on the basis of their
phylogenetic relationships into groups and subtypes. However, the
increasing complexities of newly derived HIV-1 sequences have
indicated a need to re-evaluate the current nomenclature system. In
September 1999, a meeting was held at the Santa Fe Institute, New
Mexico, to discuss the shortcomings of the HIV-1 nomenclature now in
use. The goal was to resolve ambiguities, while at the same time
retain as much of the current nomenclature as possible, so as to
avoid inconsistencies with the existing literature. A summary of the
deliberations and resulting recommendations is described below.</P>

<H2><B>II. INTRODUCTION</B></H2>

<P>A first attempt to classify HIV-1 sequences was to subdivide them
into European/North American and African strains, as sequences
derived from European and North American isolates formed a distinct
cluster in phylogenetic trees, while strains from Africa separated
into different lineages (Li <I>et al.</I> 1988; Myers <I>et al.</I>
1988). However, when additional sequences from other geographic
regions became available, it was clear that this classification
system was too limited. Instead phylogenetic analysis of envelope
sequences revealed the existence of multiple phylogenetic clusters,
or clades, which were approximately equidistant from one another.
These clades were named subtypes A to F, with the prototypic
"North-American/European" strains relabelled subtype B (Myers <I>et
al.</I> 1992). Subsequently, five of these six env-based
subtypes/clades (A, B, C, D and F, but not subtype E) were identified
in phylogenies inferred from the gag region (Louwagie <I>et al.</I>
1993). In the following years four additional subtypes, G to J, were
characterized based on phylogenetic comparisons of partial sequences
(Janssens <I>et al.</I> 1994; Kostrikis <I>et al.</I> 1995; Leitner
<I>et al.</I> 1995; Louwagie <I>et al.</I> 1995). More recently,
subtype F was reported to be comprised of sub-subtypes F1, F2 and F3
based upon gag and env phylogenetic comparisons (Triques <I>et
al.</I> 1999), but after subsequent analysis of complete genomes,
sub-subtype F3 was renamed subtype K (Triques <I>et al.</I> 2000).
&#91;The latter subtype "K"should not be confused with partial
sequences recently designated as "k" which cluster as a sister clade
to subtype D (Roques <I>et al.</I> 1999).&#93; Collectively all of
the HIV-1 subtypes group together to form a clade which has been
termed group M for "main", to distinguish them from the HIV-1 group O
(outlier) clade (Gurtler <I>et al.</I> 1994), and the recently
discovered HIV-1 group N (non-M/non-O) clade (Simon <I>et al.</I>
1998).</P>

<P>The great majority of HIV-1 strains cluster consistently in
phylogenetic trees, that is they fall into the same subtype (or
group) regardless of which regions of their genomes are analyzed.
However, it was recognized early on that a fraction of HIV-1 strains
exhibit discordant branching orders in phylogenies inferred from
different parts of their genomes (Robertson <I>et al.</I> 1995). This
finding, along with the fact that all of these viruses originated
from geographic regions where the same divergent sequence subtypes
co-circulated, strongly suggested that these viruses were the product
of recombination events. This propensity for HIV to recombine was not
unexpected, given results from previous retrovirus research (Coffin
1979; Hu and Temin 1990a; Hu and Temin 1990b) and specific HIV
studies (Li <I>et al.</I> 1988; Sabino <I>et al.</I> 1994; Diaz <I>et
al.</I> 1995), and it is now well established that recombination is a
relatively common occurrence among different strains of HIV (reviewed
in Robertson and Gao 1998; Quinones-Mateu and Arts 1999). This is
most obvious among members of different subtypes, but is also likely
to occur among members of the same subtype, although current methods
fail to reliably identify such intra-subtype recombinants. One of the
more interesting, and epidemiologically important examples of
recombinant strains, are the so-called "subtype E" viruses which are
most prevalent in Thailand and neighbouring countries in Southeast
Asia. Evidence that "subtype E" viruses might represent recombinants
was inferred initially from phylogenetic studies of gag and env
(McCutchan <I>et al.</I> 1992; Louwagie <I>et al.</I> 1993), and
later from analyses of complete "subtype E" genomes (Carr <I>et
al.</I> 1996; Gao <I>et al.</I> 1996). In the extracellular portion
of gp120 and gp41, "subtype E" viruses have long been known to
cluster as a distinct group, a finding which led to their initial
classification as an independent subtype (Myers <I>et al.</I> 1992).
In contrast, in regions such as gag and pol, all "subtype E" viruses
fall within the subtype A radiation. Thus, "subtype E" appears to
comprise a recombinant lineage between subtypes A and E, although a
"clean" (non-recombinant) subtype E lineage has not been found
leading to some debate about the recombinant status of subtype E (see
Discussion).</P>

<P>Recent advances in long PCR technologies have made it possible to
generate full-length HIV genomic sequences on a routine basis
(Salminen <I>et al.</I> 1995a; 1995b; 1996). This again has
influenced HIV-1 nomenclature, as it is now clear that recombination
breakpoints frequently occur throughout the HIV genome. It also has
become apparent that subtype assignments in the accessory gene region
can be difficult. For example, all known subtype G strains are
relatively more closely related to subtype A in the vif/vpr region.
Whether this indicates an anomaly or a recombinant ancestry of
subtype G remains unresolved (Carr <I>et al.</I> 1998b; Gao <I>et
al.</I> 1998b). Recent studies have also shown that new subtypes
cannot be assigned on the basis of subgenomic sequences only. For
example, an HIV-1 isolate previously classified as subtype I on the
basis of C2V3 sequences (Kostrikis <I>et al.</I> 1995) was found to
be a complex recombinant comprised of subtypes A, G and regions that
do not fall into any of the currently defined subtypes (Gao <I>et
al.</I> 1998a; Nasioulas <I>et al.</I> 1999). Moreover, different
non-contiguous regions of unknown subtype origin, initially all
termed "subtype I", were later found to be closely related to either
subtype H or K, or unclassified sequences representing at least one
other unknown subtype (Salminen 1999). This case exemplifies the need
for full-length genomic sequences for new subtype designations.
Finally, some HIV-1 inter-subtype recombinants are spreading
epidemically (McCutchan <I>et al.</I> 1999; Montavon <I>et al.</I>
1999; Nasioulas <I>et al.</I> 1999). These have been termed
"circulating recombinant forms" (CRFs) (Carr <I>et al.</I> 1998a) to
indicate that they represent strains that are contributing to the
global epidemic.</P>

<P>The results of the deliberations at the Nomenclature Workshop and
final recommendations are listed below.</P>

<H2><B>III. THE REVISED HIV NOMENCLATURE SYSTEM</B></H2>

<H3><B>A. Four types of categories should be used to refer to the
major HIV-1 lineages: groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes and
CRFs</B></H3>

<P><B>Groups</B> will continue to refer to the very distinctive HIV-1
lineages M, N and O (see Figure 1 and Gao <I>et al.</I> 1999 for a
description of the relationship of these different HIV-1 lineages to
SIVcpz strains). Group M includes the viruses that dominate the
global epidemic and the sub-division of this group is the focus of
this proposal. The groups were originally named M for main, O for
outlier, and N for Non-M-Non-O (DeLeys90, Charneau94, Simon98).</P>

<P><B>Subtypes</B> will continue to refer to the major clades within
group M. Examples of the subtype structure in phylogenetic trees, and
the genetic distances within and between subtype sequences can be
seen in Figures 1, 2 and3.</P>

<P><B>Sub-subtype</B> will be used to refer to a distinctive lineage
that is very closely related to a particular subtype lineage, and is
not genetically distant enough to justify calling a new subtype. The
previously recognized subtype, for example A, would thus be renamed
sub-subtype A1 and the hypothetical newly identified lineage named
sub-subtype A2. Examples of the sub-subtype organization in
phylogenetic trees, and the genetic distances within and between
subtype and sub-subtype sequences can be seen in Figures 1, 2, and
3.</P>

<P><B>Circulating Recombinant Form (CRF)</B> describes a recombinant
lineage, that plays an important role in the HIV-1 pandemic. The CRF
members must share an identical mosaic structure, <I>i.e.</I>, they
are descended from the same recombination event(s). The mosaic genome
structures and subtype compositions of the four currently recognized
CRFs are schematically shown in Figure 4.</P>

<H3><B>B. General requirements for defining a new subtype,
sub-subtype or CRF</B></H3>

<P>In order to define a new subtype, sub-subtype or CRF,
representative strains must be identified in at least three
individuals with no direct epidemiological linkage. Three near
full-length genomic sequences are preferred, but two complete genomes
in conjunction with partial sequences of a third strain are
sufficient to designate a new subtype, sub-subtype or CRF (to define
a CRF, the partial sequence(s) must also confirm the CRFs mosaic
structure).</P>

<H3><B>C. Guidelines for designating subtypes and
sub-subtypes</B></H3>

<P>A combination of phylogenetic and distance analyses should be used
to define a new subtype or sub-subtype. A new subtype should be
roughly equidistant from all previously characterized subtypes in all
regions of the genome with a distinct pre-subtype branch similar to
those of other subtypes (see Figures 1 and 2). Given the extent of
sampling of strains from the HIV-1 pandemic it is unlikely that many
more non-recombinant subtype-like lineages will be found. However, it
is possible that as sampling continues, particularly from Central
Africa, more lineages will be found that do not fit neatly into the
current subtype system. Whether such lineages will ultimately
confound the current classification system is difficult to predict at
the present time.</P>

<P>A sub-subtype should be identified when a group of viruses is
significantly more closely related to one particular subtype,
<I>i.e</I>., the new lineage should form a sister clade to the
subtype in question. Such sub-subtypes were identified in the past
but were misclassified. For example, it appears that in retrospect
subtypes B and D should have been classified as sub-subtypes B1 and
B2 or D1 and D2, rather than as separate subtypes (Figure 2), but for
the sake of consistency with published literature subtypes B and D
will not be renamed. Lineages that exhibit different relationships to
other subtypes in different regions of their genome are potentially
CRFs (see section F), and should be analyzed appropriately.</P>

To aid researchers in distinguishing between subtypes and
sub-subtypes, genetic distance analyses in conjunction with
phylogenetic approaches may be useful. To develop these genetic
distance guidelines, within- and between-class distances to ancestral
nodes were compared in gag, pol and env trees (Figure 2), or else
simple pairwise distance comparisons were compared, again, in gag,
pol and env regions, for all available full-length sequences that
could be unambiguously assigned to a non-problematic class. Figure 3
illustrates these within-subtype, between-subtype and
between-sub-subtype distances. These distances can be used to judge
whether a new lineage is more likely to be a new subtype or
sub-subtype. For example, the plots show that sub-subtypes F1 and F2
have distances that are similar to subtypes B and D. Using different
substitution models for the distance calculations did not affect the
relationship between the distributions of sub-subtype and subtype
distances. However, it has been shown that more realistic models are
preferred for detailed evolutionary studies (Leitner <I>et al.</I>
1997), and the relationships between the distributions may change due
to increased distances in the future. Thus, it should be emphasized
that all distance analyses should be carried out using appropriate
reference strains and backed up with detailed phylogenetic
analyses.</P>

<P>To provide investigators with an easy screening method, a new tool
based on genetic distance comparisons, designated the Subtype
Distance Tool (SUDI), will be available at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory (LANL) HIV Sequence Database website
(http://hiv-web.lanl.gov). This online tool will enable a user to
automatically create plots of pairwise comparisons similar to those
in Figure 3 for strains of unknown subtype or sub-subtype
classification. For example, the strains MP535C and EQTB11C that
define subtype K (Triques <I>et al.</I> 2000), when entered into SUDI
with reference strains, give the results that sub-subtype F2 is the
closest in gag and pol while F1 is the closest in env. From this, the
program calculates the distances from K to the closest lineage, and
to the other subtypes, to see if these distances are in the
between-subtype, between-sub-subtype or intra-subtype ranges. The
results (not shown) indicate that subtype K is more distant from
sub-subtypes F1 and F2 than these are from each other, but closer to
F1 and F2 that to other subtypes, <I>i.e</I>., in the range of
subtype B and D distances. This relationship of subtype K to subtype
F is confirmed by phylogenetic analysis (see Figure 2), indicating
that subtype K should have perhaps been retained as sub-subtype F3.
However, in Triques and co-workers analysis of complete genomes
(Triques <I>et al.</I> 2000) subtype K did not consistently form a
sister clade to subtype F, which is indicative of a possible
recombinant ancestry of the K/F3 lineage. Since subtype K is now an
established subtype in the literature its designation will not be
changed.</P>

<H3><B>D. Naming of groups, subtypes and sub-subtypes</B></H3>

<P>The names of subtypes A-D, F-H, J and K will be retained; these
appear to represent non-recombinant lineages relative to the known
lineages (Salminen <I>et al.</I> 1996; Gao <I>et al.</I> 1998b;
Laukkanen <I>et al.</I> 1999; Triques <I>et al.</I> 2000) with the
possible exception of the ambiguous region in the accessory genes of
subtype G (see section E). The subtype E designation will also be
retained to refer to the putative non-subtype A regions in the A/E
recombinants (see section E).</P>

<P>Any future subtypes will continue to be named alphabetically,
<I>i.e</I>., L, M, N etc.</P>

<P>Sub-subtypes will be named with a number following the subtype
letter.</P>

<P>The group M, N and O nomenclature will be retained; future groups
will be named alphabetically, <I>i.e</I>., P, Q, R etc. To
distinguish between group M and subtype M (when/if the latter is
characterized) the subtypes would be referred to as M:A, M:B.. M:M
etc., when it is necessary to avoid confusion. Similarly, if future
research identifies subtypes within groups N and O, these should
similarly be labelled N:A, N:B etc. and O:A, O:B etc. Note, future
subtype and CRF designations within groups N and O will have to meet
the same criteria as have been established for group M.</P>

<P>Until lineages have met the criteria required for a designation as
a subtype, <I>e.g.</I>, when only partial sequences or less than
three genomic sequences have been obtained (see section B), they will
be labelled "U" for unclassified.</P>

To calculate these distances, two strategies were used: (1) pairwise
distance matrices were constructed using DNADIST from the PHYLIP
package (Felsenstein 1993), with the F84 model, a
transition:transversion ratio of 1.5 and empirical base frequencies,
and (2) maximum likelihood trees (from Figure 2) and the shortest
pairwise distances within the trees summing along the branches used.
See Figure 2's legend for the alignment details. Alignments were
gap-stripped. The lineages designated as CRFs were excluded from the
calculations. Subtypes B and D were treated separately from all the
other inter-subtype comparisons. Sub-subtypes F1 and F2 were included
in the intra-subtype set, as well as treated separately, and the
F1/F2 comparisons are the outlier points in the intra-subtype
comparisons. 0.05 on the x-axis indicates 5% nucleotide sequence
divergence. The y-axis indicates the percentage of pairwise
comparisons that have the same nucleotide sequence divergence.<BR>

<B>E. The "problematic" subtypes E, G and I:</B></P>

<P>-Subtype E will now be referred to as CRF01_AE (see section F) to
reflect its distinctive phylogenetic clustering in env relative to
the rest of the genome, and the view held by the majority of the
working group's participants that it is an A/E recombinant (see
Discussion). Although the "E-like" segments in this CRF should
strictly be called "U" according to the recommendations of this
proposal, the E designation for the envelope region will be retained
for historical consistency with the existing literature.</P>

<P>-As mentioned in the Introduction, all presently characterized
subtype G strains share the same ambiguous subtype A relationship in
their accessory region indicating a possible recombinant ancestry of
this lineage (Carr <I>et al.</I> 1998a; Gao <I>et al.</I> 1998b).
However, because of the lack of a "clean" subtype G parental
representative strain, coupled with the short length of the region in
question, the naming of the subtype G lineage will be retained rather
than it be redefined as recombinant.</P>

<P>-The subtype I designation has been dropped from the nomenclature
because the isolates from Cyprus and Greece (94CY032, PVMY and PVCH
&#91;the latter two strains are also named GR11 and GR84&#93;), which
were earlier classified as recombinants of A, G and a putative new
subtype, I (Nasioulas <I>et al.</I> 1999) have, upon re-analysis with
previously unavailable complete genome sequences, been revealed to be
mosaics with regions associated with subtypes A, G, K , H and
unclassified regions (Figure 4; Salminen 1999). Thus, subtype I will
be removed from the genetic classification system of HIV strains, and
the "I" regions will be relabelled as unclassified (U). The letter
"I" will not be reused in the subtype nomenclature to avoid confusion
with the existing literature.<BR>

http://grinch.zoo.ox.ac.uk/HIV/Figure_4.html. Also, see the primary
publications mentioned in section F for each of these CRF's
definitive recombination analysis.</P>

<H3><B>F. The CRF nomenclature</B></H3>

<P>Each circulating recombinant form will be given an identifying
number, with letters (listed alphabetically) indicating the subtypes
involved, <I>e.g</I>., CRF02_AG designates the IbNg-like strains
circulating in Africa composed of genomic segments from subtypes A
and G (Carr <I>et al.</I> 1998b). If more than three subtypes are
found to make up the recombinant form, it would be designated as
"cpx" (complex) rather than a list of the subtypes involved being
given. The first complete genome sequenced from a CRF should be used
as the reference strain. The four CRFs presently identified (Figure
4) are, in the order of their discoveries:</P>

<P>&#183; CRF01_AE (reference strain CM240) which represents a
putative subtype A/E recombinant form of HIV-1 which is spreading
epidemically in Asia, but that originated from Central Africa (Murphy
<I>et al.</I> 1993; Carr <I>et al.</I> 1996; Gao <I>et al.</I> 1996).
In the future, putative recombinants with only one full-length
"parental" subtype representative would be designated as being
comprised of this subtype and unclassified regions (U). Under the new
system CRF01_AE would be referred to as CRF01_AU because the putative
"parental" non-recombinant E strain has not been found. But, as the
"E" designation for the env region of these strains is very commonly
used, renaming it would lead to confusion. Thus, the "E" designation
will be retained.</P>

<P>&#183; CRF02_AG (reference strain IbNg &#91;Howard and Rasheed
1996&#93;) which represents a subtype A/G recombinant form that is
circulating in West and Central Africa (Carr <I>et al.</I> 1998b;
Carr <I>et al.</I> 1999).</P>

<P>&#183; CRF03_AB (reference strain KAL153) which represents a
subtype A/B recombinant form that is circulating in Kaliningrad,
primarily in injecting drug users (Liitsola <I>et al.</I> 1998;
Salminen 1999). Circulation of this strain appears to have been
accelerated by intravenous injection of a locally produced opiate
contaminated with HIV infected blood.</P>

<P>&#183; CRF04_cpx (reference strain 94CY032) which represents a
Cypriot/Greek recombinant form that was previously classified as an
A/G/I recombinant (Gao <I>et al.</I> 1998a; Nasioulas <I>et al.</I>
1999). This recombinant has recently been found to be an even more
complex mosaic comprised of subtypes A, G, H, K and unclassified
regions (Salminen 1999). Note that the "I" designation has been
dropped from the nomenclature (see section E).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><B>G. Classification of genomic regions that do not cluster with
the known subtypes</B></H3>

<P>Full-length genomes or partial regions of strains that form
distinct lineages relative to the known subtypes, and do not meet the
criteria for designating a new subtype or sub-subtype, will be
labelled as unclassified (U). Segments within inter-subtype
recombinant genomes, including segments within CRFs, for which the
"parental" strain cannot be determined, will be labelled "U",
<I>i.e</I>., a subtype can only be defined for a lineage inferred to
be non-recombinant. A table including all of the strains designated
"U" will be added to the subtype reference section at the LANL HIV
Sequence Database website (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov) on the subtype
reference alignments page.</P>

<H4><B>Notes:</B></H4>

<P>1. Sequences that do not span the entire genome cannot be
designated a new subtype, or CRF, but can still, of course, be
assigned to an existing subtype, or CRF. However, such a designation
refers only to the specific fragment sequenced, as the fragment may
be embedded within a recombinant genome.</P>

<P>2. Isolates representative of new subtypes, sub-subtypes and CRFs
will be made available through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference
Reagent Program (contact Opendra Sharma, osharma@niaid.nih.gov).</P>

<P>3. We suggest that a simplified version of the WHO style
nomenclature (Korber <I>et al.</I> 1994) be used to name all newly
derived HIV strains, and include the following information: year and
country of identification, unique laboratory identification, and
clone number. For example, "99USunique_ID05" corresponds to a strain
sampled in 1999 from a person in the US, unique_ID to the in-house
laboratory designation, and 05 is the clone number. A list of two
letter country codes can be found at the LANL HIV Sequence Database
website (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov) on the DBSearch page. The two
character code "00" will be used for strains identified in the year
2000. Occasionally a person's residence and their probable place of
infection are different; in these cases, the residence should be
included in the strain name, and the place of infection recorded in
the Features or Comments section of the GenBank/EMBL entry to aid
epidemiological tracking. Indeed, it would be generally helpful if as
much information as possible about a viral strain and its host could
be included in the GenBank entry to aid comparative studies.</P>

<P>4. Authors who plan to describe new sub-subtypes, subtypes, or
CRFs should consult with database staff prior to publication to avoid
redundant namings and general inconsistencies with this newly adapted
nomenclature system. Editors of relevant journals will also be
informed of the new nomenclature guidelines.</P>

<H2><B>IV. DISCUSSION</B></H2>

<P>This proposal is intended as a reference guide to aid
investigators in properly and consistently naming new HIV-1 strains.
It should be emphasized that the working group discussed several
different revision models. However, the following considerations were
regarded as a priority and thus shaped the ultimate proposal: First,
the working group felt that consistency with the existing literature
was critically important. Thus, while some participants favoured more
extensive changes, the working group ultimately opted for retaining
current group and subtype nomenclature. Second, the working group
felt that the new nomenclature should have practical applicability.
There was consensus that the subtype and group nomenclature has been
extremely useful in the past for the tracking of the global AIDS
epidemic. As it remains unknown to what extent HIV-1 genetic
variation impacts the biological and immunogenecity properties of
this virus, molecular epidemiological surveys remain a high priority
(this is particularly true for AIDS vaccine research). The new
nomenclature proposal has thus been geared toward classifying
epidemiologically important viral strains, and is less focussed on
naming the incidental viral variant. Third, although all participants
recognized that current recombinant nomenclature can be arbitrary, a
decision was made to continue to map future recombinants based on
current criteria. Tracking more recent (and future) recombination
events was considered to be of greater practical value than trying to
reconstruct recombination events that might have taken place in the
distant past. However, the real possibility that certain presently
identified "pure" lineages might represent recombinant forms was
certainly recognized. Moreover, it was recognized that the current
naming system may in some cases reflect the order in which
discoveries were made, rather than the true biological history of the
genetic lineages. Finally, it was recognized that many more HIV
strains may be recombinant than are currently realized, as
recombination may be occurring frequently within subtypes but remains
undetected because of insensitive methods.</P>

<P>Although, for the most part, this document represents a consensus
view of the working group there was some disagreement among
participants at the meeting over the criteria used for assigning
recombinants. In particular, the classification of "subtype E" was a
point of contention. J.P. Anderson, G.H. Learn, J.I. Mullins, and
A.G. Rodrigo disagreed that current evidence favours a recombinant
origin of CRF01 (formerly the "subtype E" viruses). These
investigators reported that statistical testing using the
Kishino-Hasegawa test against the null hypothesis (that no
recombination had occurred) did not yield significant results in
support of recombination (Anderson <I>et al.</I>, submitted).
Furthermore, they stressed that certain methods commonly used to
infer a recombinant origin of a virus (bootscanning and pairwise
distance comparisons) could be indicative of recombination when, in
fact, none had occurred (Anderson <I>et al.</I> submitted). Thus,
JPA, GHL, JIM and AGR argue that there is no conclusive evidence that
subtype E has a recombinant origin. While agreeing that formal
evidence for a recombinant nature of "subtype E" viruses is lacking
(because of the absence of a non-recombinant parental strain), the
majority felt that the discordant phylogenetic positions of the
different "subtype E" genomic regions are most simply explained as
the result of a recombination event. The group felt that a mere
acceleration of evolutionary rate in "subtype E" env alone would not
be sufficient to move this cluster of viruses outside of subtype A.
To support this conclusion, it has been noted that phylogenetic trees
constructed from synonymous and non-synonymous changes yielded very
similar tree topologies (Gao <I>et al.</I> 1996). Thus, the majority
of participants agreed that "subtype E" should be designated a
circulating recombinant form (CRF01_AE).</P>

<P>As more sequence data have become available, it has become
increasingly evident that there is a need to obtain complete genome
sequences before a new genetic subtype is established. The best
example of this is the former subtype I (now designated "U" within
CRF04_cpx) in which four unclassified regions, which were initially
thought to all represent the same subtype, were later shown to be
derived from at least two different subtypes (Salminen 1999).
Although the great majority of HIV-1 recombinants presently
characterized are not as complicated as CRF04, this may change in the
future as recombinants are likely to encounter, and thus recombine
with, other recombinants. This is likely to complicate matters, as it
might become impossible to track the many breakpoints and subtype
compositions with certainty. Nevertheless, current methods allow the
identification of viruses that share the same genome structure, even
if they represent complex recombinants, and the revised nomenclature
accommodates and emphasizes such strains as they gain a wide-spread
geographic distribution.</P>

<P>The "subtypes" and "sub-subtypes" are the distinct clades that are
seen in HIV-1 group M phylogenies, but HIV-1 group M viruses have
also been characterized that do not group closely to any of the known
subtypes. Such viruses have not been designated as representatives of
novel subtypes, and are designated under the revised system as
unclassified (U). For example, the 1983 Zairian isolate Z3 was shown
not to belong to either subtype B or D (Li <I>et al.</I> 1988), and
still does not cluster with any of the characterized subtypes. As
more viruses are isolated, it is likely that more sequences will be
found that do not fall neatly into the characterized subtypes. Also,
distinct lineages such as B&#162; (or Thai B), the subtype B strains
circulating in Thailand that form a clade within subtype B (Kalish
<I>et al.</I> 1995), are not given special consideration because this
lineage clearly clusters within subtype B. Thus, it may be
unavoidable that this latest nomenclature will require further
revision at some point in the future. In the meantime, it is hoped
that the current proposal will rectify obvious inconsistencies and
provide a reasonable framework for the classification of global
strains of HIV-1. Although it is unlikely that there will be a simple
relationship between genotype (be it subtype or CRF) and biological
phenotype due to the many factors that can select and amplify strains
in the pandemic, a clear and consistent genetic classification of
strains continues to be useful for epidemiological tracking of the
pandemic, vaccine design, and for providing a foundation for
detecting biological differences if any do exist.</P>
