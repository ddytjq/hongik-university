<br>
<br>

<b><big>The future of IT development</big></b>
<br>
<br>

The future of IT development will change the shape of organisations that seek to trade on the Web and their relationship with skilled staff. VBUG can help IT departments negotiate that change by providing developers with the skills and knowledge they need to build systems that are <b>compatible with future technology</b>
<br>
<br>

As a result of recent advances in development technology, the software product is being redefined as a software service. At least some proportion of a company’s applications will consist of calls to Web services provided by other organisations. IT managers will be faced with decisions about how much processing and data management must be handled by external sources. 
<br>
<br>

The successful business application will be a seamless blend of those in-house interfaces and components that best reflect the core business of the company together with the more generic functions that are best supplied by external specialists. Related to these fundamental decisions will be a plethora of choices about service payment methods, service level agreements, availability guarantees, constant service evaluation etc. These extra concerns represent the price of being insulated against the need to develop and upgrade full systems in-house. IT departments will be leaner and meaner. 
<br>
<br>

The successful IT development team will be able to concentrate more effectively on the core business. This is happening to a certain extent already where companies are choosing ASPs to host their Messaging and Mail requirements. Relieved of the burden of technological change in this well-defined area, companies are using the opportunity to test the water – if the experiment is successful they will gradually hive off more and more functionality. To make this transition IT departments are going to need staff skilled in this collaborative type of technology – experts comfortable with the emerging data interchange standards and protocols such as XML and XML Protocol (SOAP), together with the tools that manipulate them. A grasp of technologies that enable core in-house functions to be connected with external Web services will become essential. 
<br>
<br>

It is almost universally accepted that this sea-change in IT development is happening at the same time as a worsening skills shortage. The latest survey by <a href="http://www.tug.co.uk">The User Group</a> confirms that of 428 organisations that participated, 65% reported difficulty finding staff with the right skills. Part of the problem lies with companies not adapting quickly enough to potential sources of employment such as workers over 50 who may not have the latest skills but nevertheless demonstrate a proven track record with earlier technologies.
<br>
<br>

As the new economy drives relentlessly towards greater communication between organisations, Silicon Valley has been used as an example of how employment patterns may change (see <a href="http://www.it-consultancy.com/background/newrules.html">Kevin Kelly’s Rules for the New Economy</a>, rule 5: The Law of Increasing Returns). The extremely interconnected nature of high-tech companies in Silicon Valley has fostered an enormous turnover in the number of skilled staff. Companies have to be prepared to let staff go. They can however help attract and retain staff if they are prepared to show an ongoing commitment to helping developers stay ahead.
<br>
<br>

<b><a name="#corp"></a><big>What VBUG can do to help</big></b>
<br>
<br>

VBUG is dedicated to supplying IT professionals with the skills and knowledge they need to keep up with constant change in development technology. As developers ourselves we are uniquely qualified to understand the information developers need. By investing in a corporate membership you can ensure that a team of up to 5 developers has access to our information service. The service is flexible – the individuals in your team might change but the membership benefits remain constant. Adding extra members to the membership is easy and inexpensive. 
<br>
<br>

We believe that the methods we use to deliver technical information are just as important as the quality of that information. Flexibility and relevance are everything:
<br>
<br>

<b>The written word</b>
<br>
<br>

Each member will get a free monthly technical magazine. Corporate membership allows you to choose all the publications that are relevant to your organisation and to circulate them amongst the team. <a href="/products/index.asp">Our range consists of over 20 titles</a> – from Smart Access to XML Developer. If your free allocation isn’t enough, choose the extra magazines you need at a 25% discount.
<br>
<br>

Our website <a href="/magazine/default.asp">magazine section</a> contains over 60 articles written by industry experts.
<br>
<br>

Members enjoy a 25% discount on technical books as supplied by Computer Bookshop. The final price is generally cheaper than Amazon and we process the order for next day delivery.
<br>
<br>
VBUG now supplies MSDN subscriptions (Library, Professional and Universal). For a competitive quote, please <a href="contact.asp">contact us</a>.
<br>
<br>
<b>The spoken word</b>
<br>
<br>

Each member will be able to attend free evening meetings at one of our <a href="/supportgroups/default.asp">12 regional support groups</a>. This is a superb opportunity to stay clued up on all the latest topics in development technology. Top industry experts are regularly invited to share their knowledge with members. Find out what is happening in your area.
<br>
<br>

We offer a free technical support hotline (01753 646997) to members. During business hours your members will have access to a technical expert. If he can’t answer your team’s queries, he will find the answer from another source. This is the benefit of joining an organisation with 1288 members!
<br>
<br>

Twice a year we organise a national conference that gives developers direct exposure to the essential information they need. The content is technical, relevant and well-delivered by top industry experts. <a href="vbug2000autumn/vbug2000.asp">VBUG 2000 The Annual Conference</a> delivers on every major topic worth knowing about in the Windows Development arena; XML, BizTalk and Commerce Server, XML Protocol (SOAP) and Web Services, .NET, COM+, Web security etc. This year for the first time we have introduced new workshops to give delegates a hands-on experience with the technology. All members enjoy a 30% discount to our conferences.
<br>
<br>
We run high quality <a href="/Training/default.asp">Visual Studio .NET training</a> in London, Reading, Stockport and Glasgow. 
<br>
<br>

All visitors to our website get free access to our highly popular <a href="/vaspfaq/tslist.asp">technical support forum</a> - questions posed and answered by a thriving community of IT developers.
<br>
<br>

Other benefits include free associate membership of the <a href="http://www.ukaug.co.uk/">UK Access User Group</a>, free vbug.co.uk mail account to organise developer email and regular emails packed with news about forthcoming event, membership and IT industry news.
<br>
<br>

We believe we offer a service to developers of unsurpassed quality and value for money. We also believe that the best way to be a member of VBUG is via the Corporate Membership scheme so that developers working together within an organisation can share the information we provide.

<br>
<br>

<a name="#ms"></a><b>VBUG and Microsoft</b>
<br>
<br>

Although VBUG receives assistance from Microsoft in the form of free access to their latest technology and event sponsorship, we are not a subsidiary of Microsoft. Rather, Microsoft considers VBUG to be a trusted source, ie. our audience trusts that the information we provide is both quality and unbiased. Microsoft have never dictated the content of the information we supply and welcome feedback whether it is good or bad.
<br>
<br>

We have evolved from The Visual Basic User Group to become an independent supplier of information and services to the broader audience of Windows Development. 
<br>
<br>

This evolution has been possible partly as a result of industry desire for developers who are competent in more than one area of Windows development and partly as a result of Microsoft’s drive to fully integrate their products. 
<br>
<br>

At present we concentrate on delivering information about Microsoft technologies but the scope does cover other vendors. For example, our magazine range covers Java, Delphi, Oracle and Macromedia products and our website technical support forum deals with a wide set of issues beyond the Microsoft platform.
<br>
<br>

However the decision to concentrate primarily on Microsoft technology is deliberate. We believe that Microsoft is designing the technology that is best suited for the network economy. Read an <a href="/magazine/i11/net_managers.asp">IT decision-maker’s view of .NET</a> to find out why.
