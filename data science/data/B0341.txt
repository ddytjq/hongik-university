        and Rules</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">1. A TESSA 
        Only ISA is a tax free savings account for individuals (subject to amendment 
        by Government).<br>
        2. The TESSA Only ISA is a Share Account. Shares are in Dudley Building 
        Society (the &quot;Society&quot;). You become a member of the Society 
        when your account is opened and you agree to be bound by the Society's 
        rules and the account terms and conditions. A copy of the Memorandum and 
        Rules is available on request from the Society's Branches and Head Office.<br>
        3. TESSA Only ISA Accounts are only available to U.K. residents over the 
        age of 18 years. Applications cannot be accepted from corporate bodies.<br>
        4. This TESSA Only ISA does not meet the C.A.T. standard (The minimum 
        voluntary benchmark prescribed by H.M. Treasury in regard to the Charges, 
        Access and Terms of the account).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Savings 
        Limits and Receipts</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">5. The account 
        can only be opened with proceeds from matured TESSA capital.<br>
        6. Capital must be paid into a TESSA only ISA within six months of a TESSA 
        account maturing.<br>
        7. Up to &pound;9,000 capital from a matured TESSA can be re-invested 
        in a TESSA Only ISA.<br>
        8. Any payments into a TESSA Only ISA will not affect your annual ISA 
        allowance.<br>
        9. You may subscribe to a TESSA Only ISA up to the capital amounts deposited 
        in a matured TESSA in more than one payment, provided the payments are 
        made within six months of the TESSA maturity date.<br>
        10. You cannot add to a TESSA Only ISA except in the above circumstances.<br>
        11. The Minimum investment is &pound;10.<br>
        12. The Society reserves the right to withdraw the Account from offer 
        without notice.<br>
        13. For receipts through the Bankers Automated Clearing System it is the 
        Account holders responsibility to ensure that the correct account number 
        details are provided to allow the Society to credit payments to the account.<br>
        14. Where receipts are received via the postal system the passbook is 
        required.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Cooling 
        off Period</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">15. If within 
        16 days of opening your account you decide that this account is not suitable 
        for you, if you write to us and advise us of this we will either, transfer 
        the account to another Dudley Account or arrange to return the balance 
        plus interest to you, whichever you prefer. There will be no penalty charges 
        and if you require the funds to be repaid this will be by cheque payable 
        to the account holder(s). Funds will not be returned to the account holders 
        until investment cheques have cleared which will take a period of up to 
        14 days.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Interest</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">16. The interest 
        rates payable on your account are variable and not linked to any of the 
        Society's other savings rates. We may change the rate of interest at any 
        time for any valid reason.<br>
        17. When we change the interest rates, we will tell you about the changes 
        at the earliest opportunity but at least within 3 working days of the 
        change:<br>
        (i) by general notice in our Branches<br>
        (ii) by notice in newspapers of our choice. The newspapers we usually 
        use are the Express and Star and Dudley News Group showing our previous 
        and new interest rates.<br>
        (iii) annually we will send you a summary of our products and the current 
        interest rates and all the different interest rates which have applied 
        to your account during the year (unless the account balance is below &pound;100)<br>
        18. You can find out what interest rates apply to your account at anytime 
        by contacting any of our branches or Head Office on (01384) 231414.<br>
        19.The interest will be paid gross to you and the subscriptions will not 
        count towards your ISA limits for that tax year.<br>
        20. Receipts into your account will earn interest from the day of receipt 
        to your account, although the Society requires up to 14 days before a 
        cheque will be cleared.<br>
        21. Interest is calculated on a daily basis up to the day of withdrawal. 
        If you require an explanation of how your interest is calculated please 
        ask at your local branch or contact Head Office. A written explanation 
        will be posted to you within a few days of your request.<br>
        22. Interest is credited to the account annually on 30th September and 
        on closure.<br>
        23. In the case of conflict, Inland Revenue ISA regulations prevail over 
        these terms and conditions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Availability 
        of Funds and Withdrawals</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">24. You may 
        withdraw up to &pound;500 in cash each day or a greater amount by cheque 
        providing you have the available funds in your account.<br>
        25. On your death the capital value of the ISA and the accrued gross interest 
        is payable to your personal representatives. From the date of your death 
        the ISA will receive the net equivalent rate of the ISA account with us.<br>
        26. A cheque drawn on a Dudley Building Society account will not be stopped.<br>
        27. We reserve the right not to pay withdrawals from cheques received 
        until up to 14 days have elapsed.<br>
        28. For your protection, we may require proof of identity before allowing 
        withdrawals from the account.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Identification</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">29. If your 
        maturing TESSA is not with the Society we require a TESSA Maturity Certificate, 
        your National Insurance number and two original forms of identification 
        to prove name and verification of address, or four separate forms of original 
        identification if the account is opened by post.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Change 
        of Name or Address</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">30. You must 
        notify us promptly if your name or address changes. Any notice of change 
        of name must be accompanied by evidence of the change. We may require 
        evidence of any change of address.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Repayment, 
        Issue, Closure and Transfer </b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">31. We may, 
        without giving any reason, repay to you, all or part of your investment 
        at any time after giving you at least 30 days notice.<br>
        32. We reserve the right to close any issue of the Account to new investors, 
        without individually notifying each account holder.</font><br>
        33. If you wish to transfer your Cash Mini ISA to another ISA manager 
        we will transfer the account with all rights and obligations.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Passbook</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">34</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">. 
        We will provide you with a passbook, but it will remain our property and 
        must be returned to us on request. Your passbook must be forwarded to 
        us, at such times as we may decide, to be brought up to date or for such 
        other purposes as we may require.<br>
        35. Your passbook must accompany any withdrawal and any further investment.<br>
        36. If your passbook has an entry which seems to be wrong, you should 
        tell us as soon as possible so we can resolve matters.<br>
        37. You must immediately notify us by contacting any of our Branches or 
        Head Office on (01384) 231414 if you discover that your passbook is missing. 
        You must then confirm this in writing. After you have provided such evidence 
        regarding the loss, and given any indemnity and paid such fee (if any) 
        which we may require, we may transfer the amount in the Account to a replacement 
        passbook after seven days have elapsed. If someone other than you produces 
        your passbook to us, pretends to be you, or to be authorised by you, and 
        is therefore able to withdraw money from your Account, you will be liable 
        for the amount of any withdrawals if you have acted fraudulently or with 
        gross negligence.<br>
        38. The Society will issue a passbook in the name of the Account holder. 
        The passbook may only be used in accordance with these Terms &amp; Conditions. 
        The passbook is not transferable and may only be used by the person to 
        whom it is issued. You are not allowed to enter or amend any details/ 
        transactions in the passbook.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Retention 
        and Set-Off</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">39. Provided 
        we give notice in writing, we have the right to retain and set-off all 
        money in any Account you hold with us against any indebtedness you may 
        have to us, whether under a mortgage, guarantee or otherwise, which is 
        due for payment or Repayment, but has not been paid or repaid as the case 
        may be. Interest or bonuses will not be paid on any money used in this 
        way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u><b>Variation 
        of Terms and Conditions</b></u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">40</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">. 
        These terms and conditions (other than rates of interest) may be varied:-<br>
        (a) to reflect general market conditions and standards (including the 
        terms of which similar accounts are offered by other financial institutions)<br>
        (b) so that we can compete more effectively with other financial institutions<br>
        (c) to improve efficiency and/or reduce costs<br>
        (d) to give extra benefit to savers (including making the terms of the 
        account easier to understand)<br>
        (e) to take account of changes in the law, decisions of an Ombudsman Regulator 
        or similar person or any code of practice with which we intend to comply<br>
        (f) if you agree<br>
        (g) the needs of the business justify a change.<br>
        These terms and conditions will only be changed after at least 30 days 
        notice has been given to you. This notice will be provided:<br>
        (a) through general notice in our branches; or<br>
        (b) by advertisement in newspapers of our choice. The newspapers we usually 
        use are the Express and Star and Dudley News Group.<br>
        41. If any of these changes is clearly to your disadvantage these will 
        not take effect until we have personally written to you giving you at 
        least 30 days notice of the change. If you are not satisfied with the 
        changes we propose to make, you may within 60 days of us personally writing 
        to you, ask us to switch your account or close it. Any notice period applying 
        to your account during the 60 day period will be ignored and you will 
        not incur any additional charge or interest penalty.<br>
        42. Where there has been a significant change to the terms and conditions 
        in any one year, we will send you a copy of the new terms and conditions 
        or a summary of these changes.</font></p>
