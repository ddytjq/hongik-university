He’s back – El Tel returns to soccer management
9 Jul<br>
			<SPAN Class='gentext' ><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I>Sky TV and <B>footballmatters@nationwide</B> analyst George Gavin offers his thoughts on the appointment of Terry Venables as the replacement for deposed Leeds United manager David O’Leary</I></FONT>
<P></P><P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The lure of the Premiership has proved too much for 
Terry Venables to resist - and it is not hard to see why. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Managers are now paid salaries unheard of a few 
years ago and the money is guaranteed, win or lose. Terry Venables had a secure 
job as a television pundit, but the attraction of putting into practice his 
ideas on the game tilted the balance. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Surprisingly, this will be Venables’ first 
full-time job in the Premiership. His temporary role at Middlesbrough was never 
destined to last beyond the end of the season. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>It is undoubtedly a coup for Leeds United to tempt 
him back into heat of the kitchen. There is enormous respect for him throughout 
the game and his media work has meant he has never been far from the cutting 
edge. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I have been speaking to a number of players who 
have worked for him down the years and they all point to his tactical sharpness 
and man-management as the key weapons in his armoury. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>He has the ability to make each player feel special 
and get them to produce their best. He reduces the pressure surrounding them 
with his relaxed attitude and famous one-liners. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Uptight players produce stressed-out football and 
Venables has always been able to generate a convivial atmosphere wherever he has 
been.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>However, he is not just a cabaret act – he 
understands all the nuances of the modern game. There is something else driving 
him on – a desire to win a big domestic prize. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Although he won La Liga with Barcelona, he has 
never taken a team to the League title in England – and he knows that Leeds 
United offer him that opportunity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>It is very rare that such a job becomes available. 
Managers are usually parachuted into disaster areas. As Ron Atkinson liked to 
say, they are the Red Adairs of football, putting out fires before the 
rebuilding can begin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Venables, by contrast, takes over a squad full of 
talent. In fact it is brimming over with quality. Leeds invested in new players 
when Radebe and Bridges had long-term injuries, while Woodgate and Bowyer were 
involved in marathon court cases.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Usually I would argue the bigger the squad the 
better, but in the case of Leeds I can see the argument for recouping some of 
the cash that they have splashed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Up front they have Viduka, Smith, Fowler, Bridges 
and Keane. Not even Manchester United can keep five top quality strikers happy. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Venables also has the experience to handle young 
players and any off-field problems that may arise. His high profile will keep 
Leeds to the forefront of the game at a time when marketing is a vital 
department of any big club.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>A lot of speculation has surrounded the motives of 
Leeds in going for Venables. Conspiracy theorists would have you believe he is 
there just to warm the seat for Martin O’Neill, but I do not subscribe to that 
view. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>One season is a very long time in football and, if 
Venables is a success, there is no way on earth that Leeds would want to 
sacrifice him for any other manager.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>If he fails, well, the rules apply to Terry 
Venables as much as anyone else and he will know the consequences. He once told 
me never to feel sorry for high-profile managers. "The risks are high but so are 
the rewards," he said.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Venables is very much a London lad and there may be 
mutterings about him settling in Yorkshire. I would have no qualms about that – 
he fitted in superbly on Teesside and he has managed Barcelona and Australia as 
well. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>He will, I’m sure, have taken advice from George 
Graham - one of his best friends - about life in Leeds. And it will all have 
been positive. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>All in all, the move is a major coup for Leeds and 
a great challenge for El Tel. It also adds weight to the theory that football 
chairmen in England are moving away from the attractions of the young tracksuit 
manager in favour of the experienced "silver fox". </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Think of Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Sir Alex Ferguson, 
Graham Taylor, Gerard Houllier and Arsene Wenger. All of them are in the autumn 
of their football years. That, however, is a thought for a future 
column.</FONT></P>
