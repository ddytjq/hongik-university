  <p><li><strong><font size=4 face="arial,helvetica">
  <a href="http://www.parkway.co.uk/">Parkway Research Embedded
  Seminar</a></font></strong>
  - <em>(16 April 1999, at the Oxford Union)</em>
  <br>Speakers Include:
  <br><strong>Professor Stephen Furber</strong>
  <br>Manchester Univ. have developed and are about to announce an Async
  Microcontroller: Power intelligent, low interference used in mobile comms,
  telephone.  Clockless design.  Have one big telecomms partner/customer.
  <br>Presentation: <em>TBA</em>
  <br><strong>Roger Barnett</strong>
  <br>Roger has considerable experience of embedded systems, much of which has
  been by producing development products that include compilers and debuggers.
  He has been involved with CORBA for four years, and is an active member of
  the OMG.  In addition to working with the Real-Time group at the OMG, he
  originated and chairs the Embedded Systems Group that initiated the minimum
  CORBA standard, recently ratified by the OMG membership.
  Presentation: <em>General subject of CORBA and embedded systems</em>
  <br><strong>Dominic Sweetman</strong>
  <br>Presentation: <em>Choices of Operating Systems in Embedded systems:
   From LINUX, to CE</em>
  <br>At least two more speakers are expected.  One of them might be you if you
   have something to offer.
  <br><u><strong>Call for Papers</strong></u>
  <br>The Parkway Research Embedded Seminars - Spring ~Q99. will be held on the
  16th of April 1999 at the Oxford Union in Oxford U.K. The event is
  co-sponsored by Miller Freeman : Publishers of  the Electronics Times and the
  producers of <em>Embedded Systems Conference Europe</em>. The seminars are
  technical and the goal is to explore the embedded software issues with a
  hardware flavour.
  <br><u><strong>Invitation</strong></u>
  <br>As a recognised authority you are invited to present a paper.
  <br><u><strong>Session Types:</strong></u>
  <br>The sessions are technical and last 45 minutes but the length of the
  session is always determined by the speaker. Clarity and information are key.
  <br>Topics to be included but not restricted to the following:
  <br><em>Desktop Standards in the embedded environment:</em>
  <br>This stream examines the suitability of various desktop standards
  in embedded systems:  COM, CORBA.
  <br><em>Embedding the Internet:</em>
  <br>This stream looks at the integration of embedded
  systems with the internet both directly and via gateways.
  <br><em>Hardware-software Integration:</em>
  <br>Hardware-software integration has developed
  into one of the most difficult phases of embedded systems development.  This
  stream will examine the key problem areas that need to be faced by embedded
  systems designers.  It will look at the alternative to in-circuit emulation,
  such as on-chip debug tools and the use of logic analysers.  It will also
  look at the use of simulation and virtual prototypes during software
  development to reduce bugs encountered during integration.
  <br><em>C & C++ and Java in embedded systems:</em>
  <br>This stream examines the role of
  these languages in embedded systems.  It will concentrate on techniques that
  can be used to improve performance & reduce overheads without compromising
  portability.
  <br><em>Migrating to new processor Architectures:</em>
  <br>This stream examines the key
  issues in migrating to new architectures, outlining selection, porting &
  verification techniques.  It also takes into account the role of
  multiprocessor design in which a 32bit processor is used with one or more
  8bit processor for low-level control.
  <br><u><strong>Selection</strong></u>
  <br>Selection will be based on suitability and available time our objective is
  to present a cohesive day where each session provides a contribution to the
  goal.
  <br><u><strong>Papers</strong></u>
  <br>Accepted papers will be made available on the Parkway Research web pages
  unless speakers request that this does not take place.  To present your
  submission e-mail phil@parkway.co.uk and include a short 150 word abstract
  of your topic and a Biography of approximately 80 words.

  - <em>(22-26 February 1999, at the Business Design Centre in Islington,
  London)</em>
  <br>This is not a cheap event as it is a full commercial event (where lots of
  money is poured away on PR) and the speakers are being paid (well most of
  them are) but the speakers are of high quality and include Dan Saks (those
  who have ever listened to Dan will know he is good value for money) Bruce
  Eckel (author of such books as Thinking in C++) and James Gosling (of Java
  fame).

  <br>This conference cost &pound;300 plus VAT and included two streams
  management and technical.
  <br>Keynote speakers were <strong>Eric Raymond,</strong> the author of the
  recently released Halloween documents that detail Microsoft's response
  to Open Source Software.
  <br><strong>Nicolai Guba</strong> from BT Research Labs who uses Open
  Software exclusively within his department.
  <br><strong>Peter Murray-Rust</strong> responsible for the development
  of XML parsers using Open Source development techniques.
  <br><strong>Issues that were covered included:</strong>
  <ul><li>Practical experiences of the use of Linux and Open Source Software for
  mission critical applications, i.e. banking, health, research;
  Using Linux to support 'thin client' computing to maintain compatibility
  with existing PC applications.
