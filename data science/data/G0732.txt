Theories of cosmic structure formation cannot be tested experimentally;
they must be simulated instead.  Numerical simulations of cosmic evolution
require three ingredients: assumptions about the cosmological model and
the matter and radiation content of the universe (e.g., a flat model
with cold dark matter, baryons, and a cosmological constant); a model for
the initial fluctuations (e.g., nearly scale-invariant fluctuations produced
by an early episode of inflation); and computer programs (and computers!)
for integrating the equations of motion.  The first two ingredients are at
the discretion of the simulator; the last one can be met, however, by
a standard package (computer not included).
<P>
COSMICS has been developed to provide some of the needed tools to the
cosmology simulation community.  It does not include programs for
simulating the complex nonlinear physics of structure formation; rather,
it generates accurate results of linear evolution.  For the microwave
background, excluding the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and other minor
nonlinear corrections, this is sufficient for direct comparison with
observations.  For the matter distribution, on the other hand, the results
of COSMICS provide input to nonlinear evolution codes.
<P>
COSMICS is distributed over the world-wide web as a compressed tar file.
The package consists of 4 applications, a self-test, documentation (of
which this is part), and Unix makefiles.
<P>
A typical procedure for running COSMICS is the following.  First, one
runs <tt>linger</tt> (either linger_con or linger_syn, depending on
details discussed below) to produce the data needed for matter transfer
functions or microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. Then one runs
<tt>grafic</tt> to output the normalized matter power spectrum and, if desired,
to generate unconstrained or constrained (using the Hoffman-Ribak
algorithm) gaussian random density fields on a lattice (density, velocity,
and particle displacements).  <tt>Grafic</tt> may obtain the matter transfer
function from <tt>Linger</tt> or from an analytical fit, or it may use no
transfer function at all, resulting in scale-free fields.  The normalization
of the matter powe spectrum in <tt>grafic</tt> may be specified either in
terms of the microwave background quadrupole moment <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img1.gif"> or the
rms mass fluctuation <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img2.gif">; given one, the program computes the other.
Finally, if one is interested in accurate calculations of the CMB angular
power spectrum, <tt>linger</tt> can be run at high resolution and the results
then processed by <tt>deltat</tt>.  If one desires the angular spectrum to
high degree <b>l</b>, <tt>linger</tt> runs are computationally demanding, requiring
tens of Cray C90 hours for <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img3.gif">.  The expense comes because <tt>
linger</tt> does the full calculation without significant approximations,
unlike most other codes in use today.  Most workers will not require this
accuracy; if they do, they may contact the author to see whether their
desired model has already been computed.  A future release of <tt>linger</tt>
will include <b>plinger</b> [<A HREF="node15.html#bodesc95">1</A>,<A HREF="node15.html#bodeaas186">2</A>], a parallel
implementation using message-passing that runs on a variety of
distributed-memory supercomputers.  A shared-memory version also exists
for the Cray C90.
<P>
COSMICS is available for academic use.  COSMICS users should notify me
by email to bertschinger@mit.edu, so that I can keep you informed of
upgrades and bug fixes.  Scientific publications using COSMICS should
acknowledge the author and the NSF under grant AST-9318185, which funded
the development of COSMICS.
