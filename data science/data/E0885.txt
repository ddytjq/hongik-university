<p>
There are examples in my book that are in error according to
the standard but that I haven't changed because there is a defect
report on the issue.
<p>
Issues marked by * have been resolved so that the standard agrees with my book.
The issue marked ** was resolved in favor of the draft standard.
<hr>
*pg 61:
I write
<pre>
	ostream_iterator< string> oo(os);
</pre>
I got caught by using an old version of STL where ostream_iterator
was defined like this:
<pre>
	template < class T>
	class ostream_iterator : public output_iterator {
	protected:
		ostream* stream;
		char* string;
		// ...
	};
</pre>
The standards conforming version (pg 560) looks like this:
<pre>
	template < class T, class Ch, class Tr = char_traits< Ch> >
	class ostream_iterator : public iterator< output_iterator_tag,void,void,void,void> {
	public:
		typedef Ch char_type;
		typedef Tr traits_type;
		typedef basic_ostream< Ch,Tr> ostream_type;
		// ...
	};
</pre>
Consequently, I find that my code using istream_iterators and ostream_iterators
is broken according to the standard if not for most current implementations.
For example:
<pre>
	ostream_iterator< string> oo(os);	// error: too few template arguments
</pre>
It should be:
<pre>
	ostream_iterator< string,char> oo(os);
</pre>
The problem appears to be caused by an accidentally incomplete
conversion of ostream_iterator to use templatized streams.
I think the proper definition ought to be:
<pre>
	template < class T, class Ch = char, class Tr = char_traits< Ch> >
	class ostream_iterator : public iterator< output_iterator_tag,void,void,void,void> {
	public:
		typedef Ch char_type;
		typedef Tr traits_type;
		typedef basic_ostream< Ch,Tr> ostream_type;
		// ...
	};
</pre>
I have raised the issue in the standards committee and hope to see it resolved soon. 
<hr>
pg 42	I use
<pre>
	char vc2[200];

	copy(&vc1[0],&vc1[200],&vc2[200]);
</pre>
The issue is whether taking the address of one-past-the-last element of an
array is conforming C and C++.
I could make the example clearly conforming by a simple rewrite:
<pre>
	copy(vc1,vc1+200,vc2+200);
</pre>
However, I don't want to introduce addition to pointers at this point of
the book. It is a surprise to most experienced C and C++ programmers that
&vc2[200] isn't completely equivalent to vc2+200. In fact, it was a surprise
to the C committee also and I expect it to be fixed in the upcoming revision
of the standard.
(resolved for C9x - bs 10/13/98).
(this means that the example was ok in K&R C, in ARM C++, an error in C89 and ISO C++, and ok in C9x - a thorny issue).
<hr>
pg 279:
The standard appears to prohibit making a private function a friend.
I consider such a restriction a mistake.
Someone has already listed this as a defect, but there is not yet a resolution
from the committee.
<hr>
*pg 287:
In the draft standard, for_each() is required not to modify its input sequence.
This is of course necessary when for_each() is invoked for an input_iterator.
However, I think that the requirement is unnecessary for most sequences and
that useful code is unnecessarily deemed nonstandard by this requirement.
Given the obvious and almost universal definition of for_each() the requirement
is neither obvious nor easy to avoid breaking:
<pre>
	template<class In, class Op> Op for_each(In first, In last, Op f)
	{
		while (first != last) f(*first++);
		return f;
	}
</pre>
I consider for_each() overconstrained and use it in ways that goes beyond
what is guaranteed by the draft standard.
I hope/expect that the requirement will be relaxed.
<hr>
*pg 340:
Due to an unfortunate oversight, the standard simply bans default arguments
for template parameters for a function template.
<hr>
pg 378:
The draft standard doesn't support the mapping of exceptions as I describe
it in 14.6.3.
It specifies mapping to std::bad_exception for exceptions thrown explicitly
within an unexpected() function.
This makes std::bad_exception an ordinary and rather pointless exception.
The current wording does not agree with the intent of
the proposer of the mechanism (Dmitry Lenkov of HP) and what he
thought was voted in.
I have raised the issue in the standards committee.
<hr>
*pg 519:
In the standard,
there are no versions of binders that apply to non-const elements of a sequence.
Thus, the example of for_each() using bind2nd() on page 521 is non-conforming.
Suitable versions of the binders needs to be added.
<hr>
*pg 521:
There are no versions of member function adapters for const member function
in the draft standard.
A proposal to add those versions - as they have been added to working
implementations of the library - has been made, and I hope to see the issue
resolved soon.
Given the full set of member function adapters, the examples on page 521 and
other such reasonable uses of mem_fun() works.
<hr>
*pg 522:
It is not possible to have a reference to a reference so the calls to bind2nd()
appears to be nonconforming.
The committee has resolved this issue by deeming T&& equivalent to T&.
<hr>
**pg 641:
It has been claimed that the standard is unclear about the meaning of
a string initializer for an ostring stream. For example:
<pre>
ostringstream ost("Hello, ");
ost << "world!";
</pre>
According to my reading of the standard, this should output "Hello, world!".
The claim is that ignoring the initializer and producing the output "world "
is what was intended (eventhough the standards text doesn't explicitly say so).
<p>
Resolution: That example prints "world! " If you want, "Hello, world!" say
<pre>
ostringstream ost("Hello, ",ios_base::ate); // open to write "at end"
ost << "world!";
</pre>
Note that this makes a string stream behave for a string analogously to the
way a file stream behaves for a file.
<hr>
pg 663:
The subscript operator for a const valarray returns a T rather than a const T&.
This implies that we cannot obtain a pointer to an element of a const val_array.
I believe this to be an unintended limitation.
