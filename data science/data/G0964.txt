<span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent news (Jan. 2002): FAME has been 
<span style="color: Red;">cancelled</span> by NASA, due mainly to outrageous cost overruns 
combined with technical mediocrity at Lockheed, to the total inability 
of <a href="http://www.site-inc.com/" target="_top">SITe</a> to produce our 
CCDs (zero working CCDs out of 20 runs totalling 400 chips), and to NASA 
politics combined with unfortunate NASA budgetary woes (including having to cover the 
cost overruns of each of the other three MIDEX missions).  Nobody outside
of SITe knows why the foundry runs were complete failures.</span>

        <li>The <a href="ObservationDensity/AstrometricErrors4.html">mission astrometric errors</a>,
            imposed by the scan geometry, for the latest version of the revised mission.
            The optics are still scaled by a factor of 0.7, the precession cone angle is
            still 35 degrees, but there are 8 astrometric CCDs in five columns on
            the focal plane and the cross-scan FOV is 0.878 deg (corresponding to
            a focal plane angular diameter of 1.25 degrees).  Also shown are results 
            for three astrometric CCDs, which is an approximation for the &quot;bright-star&quot;
            case. (Latest revision: 19 Oct., 2001)
        <p>
        <li>A preliminary <a href="optics/">comparative study</a> of optical element 
            single-perturbations (tilts, displacements, etc., taken one at a time) 
            for the "FAME Light" cassegrain and "FAME Classic" TMA optical designs.
            This is by no means a final word on anything, and those looking 
            for a "this design is better than that one" recommendation will be 
            disappointed. The intent, rather, is to better understand some of the 
            strengths, weaknesses, and, most importantly, <i>behaviors</i> of both 
            systems in the presence of small perturbations of the optical elements. 
            This is essentially an exercise in calculating (and interpreting) 
            derivatives of geometric wavefront expansion (i.e., geometric 
            aberration) coefficients.
        <p>
        <li>A <a href="ObservationDensity/AstrometricErrors3.html">comparison</a>
            of mission astrometric errors, imposed by the scan geometry, for several
            variations of the revised mission.
            The optics are scaled by a factor of 0.7, the precession cone angle is
            35 degrees, and there are 5, 7, 9, 11, or 13 astrometric CCDs.
        <p>
        <li>A quick look at some 
            <a href="ObservationDensity/AstrometricErrors2.html">consequences of a 
            revised mission</a>, from a mission errors and scan geometry perspective.
            The optics are scaled by a factor of 0.7, the precession cone angle is
            35 degrees, and there are 7 astrometric CCDs, one per column.
        <p>
        <li><a href="SpinAxisAngle/">An analytical study of the behavior of the 
            angle between the spacecraft spin vector and the direction of the Earth</a>.  
            This angle is important for at least three reasons.  First,
            when the plane defined by the two telescope view directions, called the 
            "observation plane" and which is at right angles to the spin axis, intersects the Earth,
            occultations of stars by the Earth occur, with resulting loss of data. 
            Second, when the observation plane passes near the Earth, the lowest 
            sensitivity part of the communications omni antenna radiation pattern is
            directed towards our ground station, resulting in uncomfortably low 
            bandwidth.  Third, again when the observation plane passes near the Earth, 
            scattered light from the Earth will degrade the observations, due to 
            poor baffling design in the instrument.

        	Introduction and geometry are discussed in the Technical Memorandum,
            <img src="../graphics/PDFsmall.gif" align="top" width=15 height=16 alt="PDF document"><a href="../Papers/ObservationDensity/Geometry.pdf">The 
            Observation Density and Scan Angle Distributions of a Spin-Stabilized, 
            Precessing, Scanning Satellite Instrument: I. Geometry</a> (FTM2000-16).
            A subset of results is available on the web page: 
            <a href="ObservationDensity/AstrometricErrors.html">FAME Astrometric Errors</a>.
            Least squares solutions for the astrometric parameters and their errors were
            performed for each simulation grid cell.  A detailed description of the method is 
            available in the Technical Memorandum:

        <li>A <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/murison/FAME/DriftAngle/" target="new">preliminary sketch</a>
            of the focal plane motions of stars due to precession, carried out to third order in
            small quantities. This page will be fleshed out as I complete the 
            <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/murison/Papers/TechMemos.html" target="new">technical memorandum</a>
            on this subject.  I have derived a general formalism that turns any analytical
            description of a perturbation of the spacecraft angular velocity vector directly 
            into perturbations of star motions at the instrument focal plane.  I've 
            analytically solved the resulting differential equations of focal plane 
            star motion to third order via a perturbation method that
            is easily extended to any order.  Precession is the largest perturbation 
            that one might wish to plug into the formalism, but there are many others 
            (gravity gradients, magnetic torques, etc. -- see my 
            <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/SymTop/SpinDynamicsIssues.html" target="new">spin dynamics issues</a> 
            web page for a large but still incomplete laundry list). 
        <p>
        <li>A study of the effects of solar eclipses on the spin dynamics of the spacecraft.  
            (web page coming soon). A
            <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/murison/Papers/TechMemos.html" target="new">technical memorandum</a>
            is currently being written up, containing results of simulations performed by
            <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/SymTop/" target="new">SymTop</a>.  Effects taken into
            account include
            <ul>
                <li>thermal expansion and contraction of the solar shield
                <li>eclipse season phase
                <li>the Sun's finite angular size
                <li>extinction due to the Earth's atmosphere
                <li>refraction due to the Earth's atmosphere
                <li>solar parallax
            </ul>
        <p>
        <li>Some <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/SymTop/TimingErrors.html" target="new">further results</a> 
            on the magnitude of the attitude perturbations and along-scan timing 
            errors due to stochastic fluctuations of the solar radiation pressure (cf. the
            <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/SymTop/" target="new">SymTop</a> homepage).
            In particular, the last plot on this page shows the along-scan timing uncertainty
            due to actual solar irradiance fluctuations (as measured by SoHO/VIRGO) as a
            function of cross-scan measurement uncertainty.  These results are from numerical simulations
            performed by <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/SymTop/" target="new">SymTop</a>.
