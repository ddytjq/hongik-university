<p class="MsoNormal">One bitterly cold afternoon in January 1969 Welsh
international Wyn Davies powered home a last minute winner against Manchester
City at St James's Park. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thirty years on and the current Newcastle United hierarchy
may come to wish that an otherwise forgettable game had petered out into a
no-score bore draw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For when Davies' trademark header hit the back of the net
Jane Duffy became irrevocably, irreversibly, hooked on football in general, and
the black and whites in particular.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then a 13-year-old pupil at Newcastle's Central High
Grammar School for Girls, she recalls: I was completely swept away by the noise
of the crowd and the excitement when the goal was scored. Until then nothing
much had happened in the game.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had gone with a few schoolfriends and to be honest we
were all pretty bored. I was beginning to wonder what my younger brother saw in
football.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That goal changed my whole outlook on the game. The noise
was incredible. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fast forward to the eve of the millennium and Ms Duffy, now
a senior education adviser for a North local authority, has become a thorn in
the flesh of United chief executive Freddie Fletcher and the club in general,
for she is the articulate, feminine voice behind the Save Our Seats campaign.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For those who have been living on the moon for the last few
weeks, Save Our Seats is a pressure group established to oppose Newcastle
United's plan to move 4,000 season ticket holders - many of whom paid £500 for
a bond they believed secured their seat for 10 years - into inferior seating and
sell theirs to the corporate market for £1,350 a year.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jane is one of four named bondholders preparing to take the
club to court, alleging breach of contract. They will seek an injunction today
to prevent the club from continuing its policy until a decision is made in
court.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was so angry when I received the letter from the club. I
thought they had just gone one step too far, Jane says.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was bad enough that they insisted on us paying to renew
our season tickets as soon as we returned from the Cup Final in May, and then
they took the roof off our stand and only informed us a week before the new
season kicked off.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the Newcastle United Independent Supporters
Association held a protest meeting, at the Companions Club, Jane was there.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before she knew what she was doing she had stepped forward
to address the meeting from the stage.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I felt the meeting was in danger of losing sight of the
objectives, which were to examine ways of stopping the club doing this to us.
Some speakers were going off in tangents.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My partner, Steve, has law qualifications and he had
pointed out to me that the wording used to persuade supporters to pay out £500
for a bond was designed to lead us to believe that we were guaranteed our own
seat, or one of equal quality.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is not going to happen if we are moved to an upper
tier of the ground. It will be like watching a Subbuteo game.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Within minutes, Jane found herself part of the Save Our
Seats action group, along with supporters representatives such as John Regan,
Frank Gilmore and the loquacious Kevin Miles, a vociferous critic of directors
Freddie Shepherd and Douglas Hall.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I used to listen to Kevin Miles on the radio or TV and
think, 'Who does he think he is, speaking out on my behalf? He doesn't represent
me'. But I listened to him talking about this policy of uprooting supporters and
found that on this particular issue I agreed with everything he was saying.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jane could be viewed as one of the new breed of
middle-class, comfortably off fans who can afford to pay £500 for a bond to
secure her seat.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After leaving Central High she went to Hull University,
where she graduated with a degree in American studies.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She took up teaching after university and became head of
History and Humanities in a number of Tyneside schools before taking up her
present post as a senior education adviser.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She lives in an affluent Newcastle suburb with Steve, her
partner, who is more of a rugby follower than football fan. Her daughter Kate,
22, is currently travelling Australia in her year off after university.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I keep her informed on the Save Our Seats developments
through e-mail, she explained.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jane sits in the Milburn Stand with her father Ronnie
Nicholson and a family friend, and follows United home and away. The only
previous occasion when I was involved in any form of protest was as a student in
the 70s, when I went on a CND march.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After leaving university I had Kate, and my protest days
were over. But I have spent so much money following Newcastle United that I felt
I had to stand up and be counted.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When they charge £500 a year for a season ticket they
should provide a decent service, and this they are failing to do.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The club has alienated an entire community. They are
treating their loyal supporters with contempt and it's time we stood up for
ourselves.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This action is not just for the bondholders, nor even for
the 4,000 who are directly affected. It is for the people in the ground who may
be moved next, and for the next generation who are being priced out of attending
St James's Park.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was able to go for the first time as a 13-year-old, but
how many children of that age are going now?</p>
