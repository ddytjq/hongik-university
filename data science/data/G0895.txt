    27, 2001:</B> Every few weeks, somewhere on Earth, a fiery light
    streaks across the sky casting strange shadows and unleashing
    sonic booms. Astronomers call them fireballs or &quot;bolides.&quot;
    They're unusually bright meteors caused by small asteroids that
    disintegrate in our planet's atmosphere. Often they explode high
    in the air like kilotons of TNT -- blasting tiny meteorites far
    and wide.</P>

    <P>It happens all the time, say experts, but usually no one notices.
    We live on a big planet, after all, and very little of Earth's
    surface is inhabited by people.  Most debris from space falls
    unseen over oceans or sparsely-populated land areas -- or during
    times when sky watchers simply aren't paying attention.</P>

    <P>Last Monday was different, however. On July 23rd hundreds
    of thousands of people were looking when, unexpected, a fireball
    appeared over the US east coast.  It was 6:15 p.m. local time.
    The Sun hadn't set, but onlookers had no trouble seeing the fireball
    in broad daylight. Witnesses from Canada to Virginia agreed that
    the colorful fireball was brighter than a Full Moon, and some
    saw a smoky trail lingering long after it had passed.</P>

    </TABLE>&quot;Contrary to some reports this was not a meteor
    shower,&quot; says Donald Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near Earth
    Object program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Meteor showers
    happen when Earth passes through the debris trails of comets
    and countless thousands of cosmic dust specks burn up in Earth's
    atmosphere. At the heart of Monday's fireball, however, was a
    solitary object -- perhaps a small asteroid or a piece of a comet.</P>

    <P>Hundreds of eyewitness reports collected by the American Meteor
    Society establish that the fireball was moving on an east-west
    trajectory that carried it directly over the state of Pennsylvania.
     &quot;It was traveling perhaps 15 km/s (34,000 mph) or faster
    when it exploded in the atmosphere with the force of about 3
    kilotons of TNT,&quot; says Bill Cooke, a member of the Space
    Environments team at the Marshall Space Flight Center. If this
    was a rocky asteroid, then it probably measured between 1 and
    2 meters across and weighed 30 or so metric tons.</P>

    <P>&quot;Asteroids that size enter Earth's atmosphere every month
    or so,&quot; says Yeomans. </P>

    <P>&quot;The pressure wave from the airburst shattered some windows
    in towns west of Williamsport,&quot; Cooke continued. &quot;Breaking
    glass requires an overpressure of about 5 millibars (0.5 kPa),
    which means that those homes were within 100 km of the explosion.&quot;</P>

    ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>No
    one knows if any sizable fragments of the object survived the
    blast. But if they did, the meteorites probably landed in the
    wooded, hilly terrain west of Williamsport -- perhaps in one
    of the many state parks of that area. </P>

     FACE="Arial">: Jim Richardson of the American Meteor Society
    created this July 23, 2001, fireball sighting map. Red stars
    denote witness locations; the tail on each star points in the
    direction that the fireball was spotted.  Blue stars denote sonic
    booms. The green rectangle and arrows indicate the approximate
    trajectory of the fireball. [<A HREF="http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireball/fireball_log.html">more</A>]</FONT></P>

    <P>Says Bob Young of the State Museum of Pennsylvania: &quot;One
    of our planetarium staff  was told that the little northern Pennsylvania
    town of Trout Run was destroyed by the meteor! The witness was
    about 100 miles away when she heard the tale from her hairdresser.&quot;
    Other reports credit the fireball for <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/07/24/fire.ball/index.html">scorching
    a cornfield</A> in Lycoming County, PA, and littering the countryside
    with burnt rocks.</P>

    <P>In fact, says Yeomans, it's unlikely that any substantial
    meteorites reached the ground. Atmospheric friction would have
    reduced most of the fragments to dust. Even if fragments did
    survive, he added, they wouldn't burn cornfields because --despite
    their fiery appearance in the sky-- freshly-fallen meteorites
    are not hot.</P>

    <P>Objects from space that enter Earth's atmosphere are -- like
    space itself -- very cold and they remain so even as they blaze
    a hot-looking trail toward the ground. &quot;The outer layers
    are warmed by atmospheric friction, and little bits flake away
    as they descend,&quot; explains Yeomans. This is called <A HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/ablation.html">ablation</A>
    and it's a wonderful way to remove heat. (Some commercial heat
    shields use ablation to keep spacecraft cool when they re-enter
    Earth's atmosphere.) &quot;Rocky asteroids are poor conductors
    of heat,&quot; Yeomans continued. &quot;Their central regions
    remain cool even as the hot outer layers are ablated away.&quot;</P>

    high-speed plunge from NASA's Galileo spacecraft into the atmosphere
    of Jupiter. Meteorites racing through Earth's atmosphere likewise
    shed heat via ablation. [<A HREF="http://ccf.arc.nasa.gov/dx/basket/storiesetc/Gheat.html">more
    information</A>]</FONT></P>

    <P>Asteroids move faster than the speed of sound in Earth's atmosphere.
    As a result, the air pressure ahead of a fireball can substantially
    exceed the air pressure behind it.  &quot;The difference can
    be so great that it actually crushes the object,&quot; says Cooke.
    &quot;This is probably what triggered the airburst over Pennsylvania.&quot;
    </P>

    <P>Small fragments from such explosions lose much of their kinetic
    energy as they heat the atmosphere via friction. They quickly
    decelerate and become sub-sonic.  Dusty debris from airbursts
    (and ablation) can linger in the atmosphere for weeks or months,
    carried around the globe by winds. Walnut- to baseball-sized
    fragments might hit the ground right away at a few hundred kilometers
    per hour. </P>

    <P>&quot;Small rocky meteorites found immediately after landing
    will not be hot to the touch,&quot; says Yeomans. They will not
    scorch the ground or start fires. On the other hand, notes Cooke,
    &quot;if we got hit by something large enough to leave a crater,
    the fragments might be very hot indeed.&quot;  A stony meteorite
    larger than 50 meters might be able to punch through the atmosphere
    and do such damage -- but that's far larger than the object that
    flew over Pennsylvania. </P>

    <P>No one knows what kind of space debris caused the July 23rd
    fireball. It might have been a small piece of an icy comet, in
    which case it's unlikely that anything larger than dust grains
    survived. It might also have been a rocky asteroid -- the most
    likely candidate -- or perhaps a nickel-iron meteorite. &quot;Iron
    objects are more likely to survive a descent to Earth,&quot;
    says Yeomans, &quot;but they are rare.&quot;</P>

    ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption">It's
    possible that fragments will never be found, notes Cooke. &quot;We
    still don't have a precise trajectory for this object,&quot;
    he explains. &quot;And so much of the targeted area (in central
    Pennsylvania) is heavily forested -- searching for debris will
    be like looking for a needle in a haystack.&quot;</P>

    <P>Or should that be a needle in a cornfield? </P>

    <P>&quot;I suppose it's possible that some ablative fragments
    fell into that field,&quot; says Cooke, &quot;but it is strange
    that only a small area was affected. I doubt it's a good candidate
    impact site.&quot; </P>

    <P>&quot;I wouldn't start looking there either,&quot; agrees
    Yeomans. &quot;That scorched cornfield story sounds a little
    too corny for me....&quot; </P>

    information to refine the trajectory of the meteor and possibly

    A fireball is a meteor at least as bright as the planet Venus
    (visual magnitude -3 or -4). A bolide is a fireball that explodes,
