<h3><font color="#ffaa00"><i>Ground Based Infrared Observations</i></font></h3>
<p>
Infrared detectors attached to ground based telescopes can  
detect the near-infrared wavelengths which make it through our
atmosphere.  The best location for ground based infrared observatories
is on a high, dry mountain, above much of the water vapor which absorbs 
infrared.  At these high altitudes, astronomers can study infrared 
wavelengths centered at 1.25, 1.65, 2.2, 3.5, 4.75, 10.5, 19.5 and 35 microns.
Telescopes as well as our atmosphere emit infrared radiation which can
complicate the observation of cosmic sources.
Infrared telescopes are designed to limit the amount of this thermal 
emission from reaching the detectors.  All ground based infrared detectors
are cooled to extremely low temperatures to reduce their emission.        
In addition, astronomers making ground based
observations measure both the emission from our atmosphere and from the 
object that they are observing.   They then subtract the atmospheric emission
from the infrared emission of a celestial object to get an accurate
measurement.

In the mid-1960's, the 
<a href="http://www.nasm.edu/nasm/dsh/artifacts/SS-caltech2.htm">
first infrared survey of
the sky</a> was made at the Mount Wilson Observatory using 
liquid nitrogen cooled PbS detectors which were
most sensitive at 2.2 microns.  The survey covered approximately 75
percent of the sky and found about 20,000 infrared sources.  Many of these
sources were stars which had never been seen before in visible light.
These stars were much cooler than our Sun and had surface temperatures of
1,000 degrees to 2,000 degrees Kelvin.  Our Sun has a surface temperature of
about 6,000 degrees Kelvin.  The brightest 5,500 of these sources made up the 
first catalog of infrared stars.
A partial infrared survey of the southern sky was also made in 1968 at the
Mount John Observatory in New Zealand.

New observatories, specializing in infrared astronomy, became possible in 
the 1960's due to advances in infrared detectors.  The largest group of
infrared telescopes can be found on top of Mauna Kea (a dormant volcano)
on the island of Hawaii.  At an elevation of 13,796 ft.,
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/mko.html">the Mauna Kea Observatories
</a>, which were founded in 1967, are well above much of the infrared 
absorbing water vapor.

By the early 1970s, it was found that the centers of most galaxies emit
strongly in the infrared, including our own galaxy, the Milky Way.  Quasars 
and other active galaxies were also found to be strong infrared emitters.
All of this new information came from near-infrared observations which could
be made from the ground.
Today, most of the larger ground based telescopes have been modified to
accommodate infrared detectors.  
Many ground based infrared telescopes are now using adaptive optics to 
create very sharp images.    
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/ao/">Adaptive optics</a>
removes the blurring of an astronomical image due to 
turbulence in earth's atmosphere.
