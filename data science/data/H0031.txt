Section 216 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 mandated two National Academies studies of Corps of Engineers planning and decision-making procedures within its feasibility studies: a) a review of the Corps' state-of-the-art planning and analytical methods, and b) a review of the Corps' independent peer-review procedures.  The WSTB, working in cooperation with the NRC's Ocean Studies Board, and with input from the Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology and the Transportation Research Board, has appointed a coordinating committee and four study panels (peer review, adaptive management for resources stewardship, project planning, and river basins and coastal systems) to carry out this request.  The panels are collectively known as "The 216 Study," named after the WRDA 2000 section mandating them.<BR>
The <I>Coordinating Committee</I> held its first meeting in September 2001 and its second meeting in February 2002, both in Washington, DC.  The coordinating committee is tracking progress of the study panels, ensuring consistency between them, and will produce a synthesis report based on the findings of the four study panels.  The coordinating committee's third meeting will be held on July 12, 2002 at Woods Hole.  The coordinating committee will also participate in a plenary session that will include representation of all the 216 study panels, to be held in Irvine, CA on November 6-8, 2002.  Leonard Shabman of Virginia Tech chairs the coordinating committee.  Larry Roesner was recently appointed to the coordinating commmitte.  <BR>
The <I>Peer Review Panel</I> is operating on a shorter time frame than the other three study panels.  It has held all three of its meetings (its third and final meeting was held March 7-8 in Irvine, CA) and will issue its final report in Summer 2002.  Jim Mitchell of Virginia Tech chairs the panel.  Other members include: Mel Briscoe, Office of Naval Research; Stephen Burges, University of Washington; Linda Capuano, Honeywell, Inc.; Denise Fort, University of New Mexico; Porter Hoagland, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; David Moreau, University of North Carolina; Craig Philip, Ingram Barge Company; John Rhett, private consultant (Arlington, VA); Richard Sparks, University of Illinois; and Bory Steinberg, Steinberg and Associates.

The committee on bioavailability of contaminants in soils and sediments held its final meeting entirely in closed session on December 17-18, 2001 at Irvine, California.  The committee is assessing the current scientific understanding of processes-both in the environmental and in the human body-that affect whether chemical contaminants present in soils and sediments at contaminated sites are bioavailable to humans, animal, and plants.  The final report is expected to be released in summer 2002. Richard Luthy of Stanford University chairs the committee.

The committee on environmental remediation at Navy facilities is advising the Navy on cleanup of contaminated soils, sediments, and groundwater at their facilities.  This phase of the study focuses on the latter stages of Navy site management, including remedy selection, remedial operation, long-term monitoring, and site closeout.  The committee held its final meeting entirely in closed session on February 27-March 1 at Irvine, CA.  The report is expected to be released in late summer 2002.  The committee is chaired by Edward J. Bower of The Johns Hopkins University.  For more information, contact Laura Ehlers at 202-334-3422 or <I><FONT COLOR="0000ff">lehlers@nas.edu</FONT></I>.<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Indicators for Waterborne Pathogens</FONT></B><BR>
To help ensure high-quality drinking water in the United States, regulators have traditionally used indicator microorganisms to determine the possible presence of microbial contamination from human waste.  Enumeration of total coliforms in water samples has proved to be a useful method for assessing sewage contamination of water, and with chlorination to reduce coliform levels, has led to a decrease in diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever.  However, an increased understanding of the diversity of waterborne pathogens and their physiology has resulted in a growing concern that traditional total coliform tests do not indicate the presence of other important classes of pathogens such as parasites and viruses, or of bacterial pathogens that do not have their origins in human waste.  Several other limitations of relying on total coliforms as indicators for waterborne pathogens have been reported.  <BR>
Acknowledging recent advances in microbiology and molecular biology and in response to recent rules and legislation concerning microbial contamination of water (e.g., the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule), EPA's Office of Water contacted the NRC's Board on Life Sciences (BLS; administrative lead) and WSTB in 2001 to undertake a study of indicators of microbial pathogen contamination in source waters (including groundwater) for drinking water and U.S. recreational waters (excluding coastal marine water and marine/estuarine water).  Full funding for this study was obtained in late 2001 and the BLS/WSTB recently finished forming a committee of experts that will meet for the first time (of four planned meetings) on April 30-May 1, 2002, in Washington, DC.  The study will result in a report that suggests candidate indicators and/or indicator approaches that are deemed scientifically defensible and practical to monitor.  The committee will consider the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates and how a list of candidates might change with future technological developments.  As part of this effort, the committee will also review and provide perspective on the current and future importance and public health impact of waterborne pathogens both in terms of drinking water and recreational contact activities.  <BR>
The committee is chaired by Mary Jane Osborn (NAS), University of Connecticut, and vice-chaired by R. Rhodes Trussell (NAE), Montgomery Watson Harza, Inc., Pasadena, CA.  The committee also includes Ricardo De Leon, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, La Verne, CA; Daniel Fung, Kansas State University; Charles Haas, Drexel University; Deborah Levy, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA; J. Vaun McArthur, University of Georgia, Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, Aiken, SC; Joan Rose, University of South Florida; Mark Sobsey, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; David Walt, Tufts University; Stephen Weisberg, Southern California Coastal Water Research Project Authority, Westminster, CA; and Marylynn Yates, University of California, Riverside.

The Committee on the Restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem (CROGEE) is tasked with providing a scientific overview and technical assessment of the many complicated, interrelated activities that are occurring at the federal, state, local, and nongovernmental levels.  In addition to strategic assessment and guidance, the committee provides more focused advice on technical topics of importance to restoration efforts.  One such report on Florida Bay Research Programs and their relation to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was sent to review in late March 2002. <BR>
A workshop on adaptive assess-ment and monitoring was held on November 28 at Fort Myers, FL.  A report on the workshop is currently being prepared. At the same meeting, the committee also heard presentations on ecological, hydrologic, and planning issues in southwest Florida; met with the Science Coordination Team, an advisory group of the agencies and tribes involved in Everglades restoration; and toured the Caloosahatchee estuary.  The CROGEE met again on February 7-9 in Jacksonville, Florida, where the committee discussed the water storage components of the restoration plan, including water regulation and management goals, options considered and constraints, and modeling/technical issues.  The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for June 17-19.  Jean Bahr of the University of Wisconsin chairs the committee.  For more information, contact William Logan at 202-334-3422 or <I>wlogan@nas.edu.</I><BR>
As mandated by congress, a panel was recently appointed to study the effectiveness of the Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiatives (CESI) program.  The Panel to Review the Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative (CESI) is organized under the existing NRC Committee on Restoration of the Greater Everglades System.  It will assess the types and funding levels of the science being conducted in the National Park Service CESI program in light of the scientific activities of other entities and the needs of the overall restoration effort.  The panel will provide advice with respect to CESI strategic planning, and providing guidance regarding information management and transfer aspects of science produced in the CESI to help assure support for decision making during planning, implementation, and operation phases of restoration.  Linda Blum of the University of Virginia, Charlotesville chairs the panel.  The other panel members are: Jed Barzen, International Crane Foundation, Baraboo, Wisconsin; Lauren Chapman, University of Florida, Gainesville; Peter deFur, Virginia Commonwealth University, Center for Environmental Studies, Richmond; Dominic Dottavio, Ohio State University, Marion; William Graf, University of South Carolina, Columbia; James Heaney, University of Colorado, Boulder; Stephen Humphrey, University of Florida, Gainesville; Stephen Light, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Minneapolis; Charles O'Melia, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore; Carol Wicks, University of Missouri, Columbia; and Daniel Williard, Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs (retired), Bloomington.

The joint Ocean Studies Board/WSTB committee was formed in December 2000 in response to a request by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Jacksonville District) to review the Florida Keys Carrying Capacity Study (FKCCS) and the accompanying Carrying Capacity Analysis Model (CCAM) that is under development by the State of Florida.  More specifically, the committee is tasked to evaluate the scientific methods, principals, and data that form the basis for the FKCCS and CCAM.  The goal of the FKCCS is to "determine the ability of the Florida Keys ecosystem to withstand all impacts of additional land development activities."  The FKCCS examines three study categories: 1) natural resources, including ecosystems, species of concern, and water quality; 2) the social environment, including regional economic impacts, quality of life, community character, and sustainable tourism; and 3) human infrastructure, including hurricane evacuation, water supply and other needed services such as schools, law enforcement, etc.  It will also create a planning tool in the form of the CCAM to attempt to determine the level of land development activities that will avoid further adverse impacts to the Florida Keys ecosystem.<BR>
The committee participated in a 2-day meeting on the FKCCS and the public unveiling of the first (mostly conceptual) Draft CCAM in Key Largo on January 9-10, 2001, and met in closed session on January 11 to form the basis of an interim ("letter") report that made recommendations for the continued development of the Draft CCAM.  The interim report was released in March 2001.  The committee met again on January 17-18, 2002, in Miami to conduct an expedited review of the first complete Draft ("Test") CCAM that was released in late 2001.  The independent review offers critical commentary and recommendations to assist the sponsors and contractors in making final adjustments to the Draft CCAM.  The committee's report was recently released in March 2002.  The committee is chaired by Scott Nixon of the University of Rhode Island.

The joint BEST/WSTB Committee on Toxicants and Pathogens in Biosolids Applied to Land was formed in early 2001 to review the risks and evaluate the risk assessment methods used by EPA for establishing regulatory standards for chemical pollutants and pathogens in biosolids (treated sludge) applied to land.  The study will consider whether approaches for assessing risks from chemical and pathogenic pollutants should be integrated and, if so, approaches for integration will be recommended.  It will also build on the 1996 WSTB report <I>Use of Reclaimed Water and Sludge in Food Crop Production</I>.  The committee held its fourth meeting on December 10-11, 2001, in Irvine, CA and expects to send its report to external review in March 2002.  A fifth meeting will be held on March 28-29, 2002, in Washington, DC, if needed to help complete the report that should be released in Spring 2002.  <BR>
Thomas Burke of The Johns Hopkins University chairs the committee.  For further information, contact Susan Martel of BEST at <I>smartel@ nas.edu.</I><BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Services and Values of Aquatic and Related Terrestrial Ecosystems</FONT></B><BR>
Aquatic and related terrestrial ecosystems include lakes, rivers, streams, estuaries, wetlands, adjacent riparian systems, and upland areas together with their associated flora and fauna.  They perform numerous environmental functions, such as recycling nutrients, purifying water, attenuating floods, recharging groundwater, and providing habitats for wildlife.  In addition, aquatic and related terrestrial ecosystems often form the basis of economic livelihood and are widely used for recreational purposes.  But human activities of all kinds have increasingly led to pollution, adverse modification, and devaluation of these valuable natural resources.  While ecosystem functions may be useful markers for studying the physical, biological, and chemical processes at work in aquatic resources, they are seldom experienced directly by users of the resource.  In contrast, economists find it more helpful to think of the "services" of a resource-the things that create value for human users.  Thus for aquatic and related terrestrial ecosystems, the intrinsic value of hydrologic, biogeochemical, and biological services can be more readily assessed. <BR>
The study will identify and assess existing methods for defining and assigning economic values to the services of aquatic and related terrestrial ecosystems. The assessment will include consideration of the errors and biases characteristic of such methods and whether their increased use will lead to improved environmental decision making.  This newly appointed committee will meet four times during an 18-month study period to gather information, deliberate critical issues, and write its report.  Geoffrey Heal of Columbia University chairs the committee.  Other members include: Edward Barbier, University of Wyoming; Kevin Boyle, University of Maine; Alan Covich, Colorado State University; Steven Gloss, Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center; Carl Hershner, Virginia Institute of Marine Science; John Hoehn, Michigan State University; Catherine Pringle, University of Georgia; Stephen Polasky, University of Minnesota; Kathleen Segerson, University of Connecticut; and Kristin Shrader-Frechette, University of Notre Dame.  The committee should meet for the first time in Spring 2002.  For more information, contact study director Mark Gibson at 202-334-3422 or <I>mgibson@nas.edu.</I><BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Source Removal of Contaminants in the Subsurface</FONT></B><BR>
The WSTB has commenced a study on the effectiveness of source removal as a strategy for cleaning up contaminated groundwater and soil at hazardous waste sites.  Source removal, which encompasses such remedies as <I>in situ </I>chemical oxidation, thermal treatment, and solvent or surfactant flushing, is increasingly being debated and considered for remediating recalcitrant contaminants (e.g., dense nonaqueous phase liquids) in heterogeneous subsurface environments.  The first phase of the study will analyze data and methods to determine the effectiveness of current source removal activities.  The later phase will focus on evaluating the effectiveness of source removal activities at several Army sites using the criteria and information generated from the first phase.  The committee is currently being formed and additional nominations are welcome.

The WSTB/BASC Committee on Hydrologic Science (COHS) is a standing committee that reviews and provides advice on scientific activities of U.S. federal agencies and U.S. contributions to international programs in hydrologic science.  It also provides guidance for the development of the hydrologic science field.  Last year, COHS published a report on <I>A Workshop on Predictability and Limits-to Predictions in Hydrologic Systems </I>(see page 12).  COHS also helped create the NRC Committee on a Review of a Plan for a New Science Initiative on the Global Water Cycle.  This ad hoc NRC committee reviewed an earlier report commissioned by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and released its own report in February 2002 (summarized on page 11 of this issue).  The next COHS meeting, to be held April 1-2, will focus primarily on how the different USGCRP agencies plan to implement and coordinate their efforts on this Water Cycle Initiative.  The subsequent meeting will be a workshop on Groundwater Fluxes across Interfaces, to be held in Egg Harbor, WI on May 12-13.  Eric Woods of Princeton University chairs this committee.

<B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Water Quality Improvement for the Pittsburgh Region</FONT></B><BR>
Thousands of residents of southwestern Pennsylvania, particularly in rural areas, lack clean and reliable water supplies, adequate wastewater systems, or both.  Moreover, nearly all of the region's residents receive water from surface and groundwater sources that are periodically compromised by inadequate sanitation (i.e., contain unacceptable levels of potentially harmful microbial pathogens). <BR>
The cost of the improvements necessary to correct this regional water quality program are large (projected to cost between 8-9.5 billion dollars).  However, the cost of letting the water quality problem continue unabated may be greater over time in terms of adverse impacts on public health, the environment, and economic growth.  Regardless of the funding approach ultimately taken, for many communities a significant gap will remain between what is needed and what can be afforded.  Thus, infrastructure investment must be strategic.  Such a proactive approach will help obtain infrastructure how and where it is needed rather than where it is forced through regulatory actions or as a result of protracted and expensive litigation.<BR>
The WSTB has been working with the Allegheny Conference on Community Development and The Pennsylvania Economy League for almost a year to undertake a study of the wastewater and water quality problems of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area and make recommendations on how these issues and needs of the region can be best addressed by the multiple jurisdictions on a cooperative basis.  The study should help the public and private organizations of the Pittsburgh region develop public awareness of the issues and the need for collaborative strategies for water quality improvement and management.  It is envisioned that such a WSTB study can provide an instructive model for the EPA and other urban areas where a regional cooperative approach to wastewater and water quality management can be considered.  Efforts to obtain necessary funding are nearly complete and the WSTB hopes to form a committee of experts and initiate the study in early Spring 2002.
