      An ideal way to save for a particular reason (for example, to save for 
        a deposit to buy a house), get a good return on your investment and have 
        access to your money in case of emergency.
      <p>Attractive variable interest rate - <STRONG>4.25%</STRONG> gross&#134;/AER* (currently 
        equivalent to 3.40% net p.a.&#134;).</p>
      <p>Interest is paid annually on 1st October.</p>
      <p>Interest can be added to your account (where it immediately starts earning 
        more interest), transferred to another Chelsea account or to your bank 
        account.</p>
      <p>And for those unexpected events, the Chelsea Regular Savings Account 
        features an immediate withdrawal facility - see <a href="#Access">Access 
        to your money when you need it</a><br>
      </p>

	  <STRONG><a name="Howmuch"></a><span class="redtext">How much can I invest? 
        </span></STRONG><br>
      This account has been designed for regular savings on a monthly basis.
      <p>You can open an account with any amount from a minimum of &pound;10 to 
        a maximum of &pound;1,000.</p>
      <p>After that you need to invest between &pound;10 and &pound;1,000 per 
        month. You can change the monthly amount that you pay into your account 
        as often as you wish, but you can only pay up to &pound;1,000 into your 
        account per month.</p>
      <p><STRONG>A minimum of 10 monthly payments (within the above limits) must be 
        made in each 12 month cycle, with the first cycle starting on the first 
        day of the month in which the account is opened. </STRONG></p>
      <p><STRONG>If this minimum level of payment is not made, your account will be 
        switched to the Chelsea Instant Savings Account, which is an instant access 
        account. A lower rate of interest will then apply (see terms for full 
        details).</STRONG></p>
      <p>The maximum investment permitted is &pound;50,000, provided that your 
        total investment in this and all other Chelsea accounts does not exceed 
        &pound;1 million. <br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG><a name="Access"></a><span class="redtext">Access to your money when you need it</span></STRONG><br>
      This account has been designed for those investors who wish to accumulate 
        capital on a regular monthly basis and tie up their money in the medium 
        term in return for an attractive rate of interest.
      <p>However, there may be times when you need access to your money (in an 
        emergency, for example) and for this reason you have the benefit of immediate 
        access to your funds at any Chelsea branch with your passbook. </p>
      <p>Up to &pound;250 in cash or &pound;5,000 by cheque may be withdrawn immediately. 
        Larger sums may be withdrawn by cheque within a few days.</p>
      <p><STRONG>However, it should be noted that withdrawals from the Chelsea Regular 
        Savings Account are limited to TWO per 12 month cycle, with the first 
        cycle starting on the first day of the month in which the account is opened. 
        </STRONG></p>
      <p><STRONG>Three withdrawals or more will result in your account being switched 
        to the Chelsea Instant Savings Account, which is an instant access account. 
        A lower rate of interest will then apply (see terms for full details).</STRONG><br>

      Investors of any age can save with a Chelsea Regular Savings Account.
      <p>However, if you are aged 13 or under, a parent/guardian or other adult 
        will need to open the account for you on your behalf. </p>
      <p>All they will need to do is complete the application form in their own 
        name(s) and add your name in the 'I am investing as a trustee of&#133;' 
        box. </p>
      <p>Then, once you are 14, if you wish, you can open a Chelsea Regular Savings 
        Account in your own name.<br>
