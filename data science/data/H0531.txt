<p>Large scale genomic sequencing is ongoing at the
Washington University Genome Sequencing
Center, focusing on human and <I>C. elegans</I> DNA.
The <I>C. elegans</I> project is in its final year with a
total of 71 Mb finished sequence (in collaboration
with The Sanger Centre, Hinxton, UK). The
human project has been maturing since funding
began last year, and we now have 15 Mb finished
human genomic sequence. The goals for each
project are similar; to achieve contiguous,
base-perfect sequence. For <I>C. elegans</I>, a
clone-based sequence-ready map has provided the
majority of sequencing substrates, including
cosmids and YACs. A minimal tiling path of
cosmids were chosen, although recently we have
selected YACs for direct sequencing. Additionally,
direct probing of a <I>C. elegans</I> fosmid library has
provided bacterial clones for regions previously
spanned only by YACs, facilitating sequence
contiguity. We have incorporated an up-front,
sequence-ready mapping paradigm for human
genomic DNA. Chromosome 7 STS information is
being translated into sequence-ready bacterial
contigs. As the sequencing progresses, we are
actively working to close gaps in the bacterial
clone map by re-screening the large insert libraries
with probes based on end-sequence data, additional
markers, or overlapping YACs. Candidate clones
are chosen for sequencing after evaluating the
fingerprint data to verify clone fidelity and overlap
through a region.


<p>Sequencing is performed using a mixed shotgun
strategy, which includes initial sequencing of
random subclones followed by directed approaches
for gap closure and ambiguity resolution. The
quality of the assembly and sequence editing are
monitored by reassembly and comparison to the
finished sequence. Additionally, the restriction
digest sizes are compared to that based on the
finished sequence. During analysis and annotation
of the finished sequence, potential exons are
identified by similarity to EST data and known
protein sequences, and by gene prediction
programs.


<p>An overview of the projects will be presented,
addressing our strategies, progress, and methods
for quality control at each stage of the process.
Additionally, recent software tools and technology
developments (see abstract by E. Mardis) which
have increased our throughput of high quality data
will be included.

<p>In order to complete the DNA sequence of the
human genome, collaboration of a group of high
throughput sequencing centers will be necessary.
The UTSW Genome Sequencing Center has as its
goals: 1) development of 100 mb/year sequencing
capacity, 2) complete sequencing of human
chromosomes 11 and 15 and 3) developing
exportable technology and robotics to support high
throughput genomic sequencing. Aspects of this
project include high throughput mapping to
generate sequence ready PAC and BAC template
sets, pilot projects to sequence megabase-sized
contigs on chromosome 11p15.5, 11p14, 11q23,
15q26 and 15q11, and technology development
projects in robotics and informatics. The strategy
for integrated map construction, sequencing and
data annotation involves assembly of a precise
sequence-ready map using STSs, ESTs, regionally
mapped genes and other probes screened against a
10X total human BAC library which meets ethical
and legal standards of informed consent and
anonymity. BAC clones are isolated by array
hybridization with radiolabeled pooled
oligonucleotides, identity confirmed by PCR with
specific markers and FISH, and clones
fingerprinted. BAC/PAC end-sequencing is widely
utilized for gap filling, contig establishment and
sequence annotation. BAC clones are sequenced by
M13 shotgun sequencing and fragments assembled
into initial contigs using PHRED and PHRAP.
Gap filling and quality improvement to an
estimated sequence accuracy of 99.99% are
accomplished by oligonucleotide-directed
sequencing from BAC and PAC templates.
Sequence processing, assembly, quality control and
annotation and implemented through informatics
tools developed in the center. The effort is
augmented by the robotics and instrumentation
developed in the center including MERMADE high
throughput oligonucleotide synthesizers, the
Sequencing Support System, a 3 m Sagian rail
robot developed for automated sequencing, and a
high capacity DNA sequencer under development.
The center has produced 4.2 mb of DNA sequence
and analysis and annotation of 750 kb of
contiguous sequence for 11p15.5 region have been
completed with an anticipated 2 mb of continuous
sequence by the end of 1997.

<p>Chromosome 19 is the most GC-rich of the human
chromosomes as determined by flow cytometry. It
is predicted to be very gene rich, with an estimated
2000 genes contained within ~60 Mb of
euchromatin. A high resolution physical map of
human chromosome 19, constructed largely in
bacterial-based clones, serves as a resource for
targeted genomic sequencing in regions of high
biological interest. One interesting feature of
chromosome 19 is the high density of clustered
gene families such as zinc finger genes (ZNFs),
olfactory receptors (OLFRs) and cytochrome
P-450s (CYPs). In order to understand their
evolution and subsequent functional
diversification, several of these clusters are current
sequencing targets. We are also interested in genes
involved in DNA repair, and have performed
genomic analyses of 6 such loci, many in both
human and mouse. To date we have completed
over 2 Mb of genomic sequence from chromosome
19 and other human and rodent targets, using a
shotgun strategy. Our largest completed sequence
contig is ~1 Mb and is located in 19q13.1, flanked
by the genetic markers D19S208 and COX7A1.
Preliminary analysis of this contig indicates a
relative gene density of ~1.7 per 40 kb, and an
average Alu density of 1.1 Alu/kb (~31%), which
is comparable to other previously sequenced
regions of chromosome 19. Of the 43 putative
genes identified, two appear to be pseudogenes, 7
encode putative cell surface proteins (e.g.
glycoproteins), and 14 are completely novel.
Progress towards completion of an &gt;800 kb contig
in 19p12 and regions containing clustered OLFR
and ZNF gene family members will also be
presented.

Finger-Containing Genes Located
within a 339kb Region in Human
Chromosome 19q13.2</b></a>

<p>Genetic and physical mapping studies indicate that
hundreds, if not thousands, of zinc finger
(ZNF)-containing genes populate the human
genome, and that many of these genes, including
those with Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)
motifs, are arranged in familial clusters. In a
previous study, we identified a KRAB-containing
ZNF gene family located near the XRCC1 gene in
human chromosome 19q13.2 (H19q13.2).
Preliminary characterization of this family
indicated that the genes are arranged in a
'head-to-tail' tandem array with an average
intergenic spacing of 20-30kb. Current estimates
based upon physical mapping data suggest that this
family is comprised of at least 15 members, which
span a minimum of 600kb in 19q13.2. Restriction
mapping studies, in combination with Southern
blot analyses using ZNF consensus and KRAB
sequence probes, have allowed a preliminary
determination of this family's content and
organization. In depth studies of the largest cosmid
contig from the region have demonstrated that nine
genes are present within 339kb, encompassing the
proximal one-half to two-thirds of the gene family.
A number of methods, including Southern blot
analysis, PCR analysis and DNA sequencing, have
been used to localize expressed sequences within
an EcoRI restriction map (RMAP) of this region.
Several sequences present in the Genbank database
(ZNF45, ZNF155, and HZF4 as well as ESTs
429289, 20113, and 28165) have been localized to
specific sites within the RMAP. The region also
contains three previously unknown gene sequences.
Sequence analysis of cDNA clones for eight of the
genes indicates that while the KRAB A domains of
the sibling genes are highly similar in structure,
other portions, including the KRAB B and ZNF
domains, are highly divergent in sequence. These
observations suggest that this gene family may
have evolved to encode a collection of transcription
factors that bind to different target DNA sequences
as a result of divergent ZNF arrays, while
participating in common transcription control
complexes due to their highly similar KRAB A
domains. Interestingly, the genes are expressed
widely in adult tissues and are co-expressed in
many sites. However, tissue-specific variations in
levels of transcript between the genes are also
evident. Such overlapping, but not identical,
expression patterns are consistent with the idea
that, like coding sequences, the duplicated
cis-acting regulatory regions of the sibling genes
have diverged over evolutionary time as they
acquired new biological functions. Comparative
mapping studies have demonstrated that a
homologous Xrcc1-linked gene family is present in
the mouse genome. Preliminary studies indicate
that three members of the murine gene cluster are
orthologous to genes located in H19q13.2. Future
studies will address whether the historically
homologous mouse and human genes are subject to
the same upstream regulation and whether they
regulate the same downstream genes.

<p>We have recently begun full genomic sequencing
of a 3.0 Mb cosmid/P1 contig of the human
chromosome region in 16p13.3 extending from the
polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) locus to the
CREB binding protein (CREBBP) locus
[responsible for Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome and
implicated in acute myeloid leukemias associated
with translocations t(8;16)(p11;p13.3) and
t(11;16)(q23;p13.3)]. This contig encompasses the
recently cloned Familial Mediterranean Fever gene,
and the syntenic breakpoint between mouse
chromosomes 16 and 17. The average overlap
between clones in the contig is 25%. Sample
sequencing of this region has revealed that it is
gene rich and G+C rich (&gt;50% G+C), with the
gene density approaching one gene/10 kb in some
stretches. These observations are consistent with
the cytogenetic designation of 16p13.3 as a G+C
rich 'T' band (Dutrillaux, 1973; Holmquist, 1992).
Our strategy for sequencing involves nebulization
to randomly break DNA, size selection of 3 kb
fragments, double adapter cloning into bluescript
KS+ plasmid, and sequencing of both ends to 5 X
random sequencing coverage. Assembly of
sequence contigs is constrained by the inherent
relationship of the end sequences being
approximately 3 kb apart. Closure is achieved by a
combination of primer walking, longer reads, and
alternate chemistry reactions. To date we have
sequenced to approximately 2 X coverage for the
first Mb of this contig and approximately 1 X
coverage for the remaining 2 Mb. Supported by the

<p>The Human Genome Project is undergoing a rapid
transition from an emphasis on generating physical
maps to the large-scale finished sequencing of
human DNA. Current technology will allow a large
fraction of human DNA to be sequenced in the
next 5-10 years by highly automated,
high-throughput sequencing "factories". A
significant fraction of the human genome, however,
will be difficult to sequence to completion by such
"factory" approaches. These are regions that: 1)
contain a high percentage of repetitive DNA
sequences, 2) contain internal tandem duplications,
including multigene families, and/or 3) are
unstable in all current sequencing vectors. This
would be irrelevant if such regions were rare, or
contained little of intrinsic informational value.
Such is not the case. The first five years of the
Human Genome Project mapping efforts have
indicated that such regions represent
approximately 20% of human DNA. This includes
such critical regions as centromeres and telomeres,
as well as a greater abundance of low-copy repeats
and multigene families than previously anticipated.
Producing quality DNA sequence of these regions,
which faithfully represent genomic DNA, will be a
continuing challenge.


<p>We propose that a large-scale, yet distributed
"boutique" approach to mapping and sequencing
such regions is warranted, where individual
laboratories specialize in genomic regions they
have special expertise in investigating. Such efforts
would complement and integrate with the few truly
large-scale sequencing centers that are likely to
evolve during the next few years, such as the
proposed DOE Joint Genome Institute Sequencing
Center. Our initial iboutiquei target is telomeric
regions, which exhibit high levels of repetitive
DNA composition, cloning instability, and
population heterogeneity. Numerous investigations
have implicated genes near telomeres as likely
targets for alterations during aging and cancer
progression. Through the efforts of a number of
laboratories, most notably Dr. Harold Riethmanis
at the Wistar Institute, nearly all human telomeres
have now been cloned by functional
complementation in yeast. My laboratory has
finished the 0.23Mb 7q telomere sequence (Chi
et.al., this meeting), the first RARE cleavage
confirmed human telomere region to be sequenced
directly up to the terminal (TTAGGG)n repeat. An
important QC/QA aspect of this project was the
extensive confirmation of the sequence against
genomic DNA by PCR-sequencing (White et.al.,
this meeting). Greater than 3Mb of confirmed
telomeres are now available for sequencing, with
another 6-12Mb currently being confirmed. These
represent 43 of the 46 unique human chromosome
ends. The finished and annotated sequence of these
clones will "cap" the world-wide genome
sequencing effort, and identify numerous important
genes and polymorphic markers.

<p>225,432 bp of DNA immediately internal to the
(TTAGGG)n telomere repeat of human
chromosome 7q was sequenced. The telomeric end
of chromosome 7q, unlike most human
chromosomes, contains only a few (&lt;1.5 kb
nucleotides in total) subtelomeric repetitive DNA.
The lack of subtelomeric repeats, therefore,
suggested that this region would likely contain
subtelomeric genes whose expression would be
affected by telomere alterations accompanying
aging and cancer progression (Moyzis et. al., this
meeting). Nine overlapping cosmids and two PCR
products obtained from the 7q telomere YAC clone
HTY146 (yRM2000) were sequenced using a
Sample Sequencing (SASE)-parallel primer
walking strategy. Sequence validation was
performed on PCR amplified human genomic
DNA from at least 6 individuals including the cell
line used to construct HTY146. Primer pairs
(spaced 300-900 bp) were randomly picked from
25 sites that are almost evenly distributed along the
entire 7q terminal region. The QC/QA results
confirmed that the cloned YAC/<I>E. coli</I> sequences
were a faithful representation of genomic DNA,
containing less than one error in 10,000 bases
(White et. al., this meeting). Computer analysis
uncovered numerous open reading frames,
expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and potential
exons dispersed along the entire 226 kb region, as
well as 19 variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTRs) and 20 microsatellite repeats.
Approximately 192 kb internal to the (TTAGGG)n
terminal repeat the first and second exons for the
human vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2
(VIPR2) gene were located. This gene is involved
in a diverse set of physiological functions including
smooth muscle relaxation, electrolyte secretion,
and vasodilation. SASE-parallel primer walking is
efficient for finished sequencing and gene
lacalization of a long range genomic target,
especially a idifficulti region like telomeres.

<p>The 7q telomere region was sequenced to examine
if this region contained expressed genes close to
the telomere or served as a buffer area between the
telomere and expressed genes in the advent of
telomere shortening. A CpG island next to the few
exons of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
receptor 2 precursor gene were discovered (remain
exons presumed to be centromeric of the sequenced
region). This 225,432 bp sequence contains
multiple EST clusters and evidence for additional
candidate genes as well as a large array of
repetitive sequences and one type I
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase
pseudogene. Interesting, a second candidate gene
exists in the form of 7 close regions of homology
with chromosome 4 cosmid L191F1. Evidence for
a third candidate gene can be pieced together from
EST clones with homologies to both the 5' and 3'
ends. These paired EST end sequences link
together multiple candidate exons in what may be
an alternatively spliced gene. An update of the
sequence analysis of this region will be presented.


<p>As part of the sequence verification for the 7q
region, we have PCR amplified and sequenced
~300 bp from each of 19 sites along this region,
from at least 6 individuals representing 4 diverse
ethnic groups. In addition, we sequenced the
genomic DNA used to build the 7q YAC library,
and the supporting YAC clone, HTY-146. For
each site, PCR primers were selected in regions
free of known repeats. All PCR products were
sequenced and compared to detect errors and
polymorphisms. Sequence comparisons among
individuals give us an idea of the amount of natural
variation, as well as validate the clone sequence to
the genomic DNA from which the clone originated.
Out of 5722 nucleotides resequenced (2.5 % of
total) there was one heterozygous site found in the
individual from which the library was constructed,
and 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
among the other individuals. All other sequences
were identical between the clone sequence and that
of the individual from which the library was made.
These results are in agreement with previous
estimates that natural variation at the primary
sequence level is at least 1 in 1000, which needs to
be considered when performing sequence
validation aimed at detecting a one in 10,000 error
frequency.

<p>We are implementing an approach to large-scale
sequencing of human genomic DNA that
emphasizes high-quality at a reasonable cost.
Quality targets are: 1) a single-base-pair error rate
of better than 0.01%, 2) no gaps, in either the
shotgun sequence or the physical map, across
mega-base sized regions, and 3) validation of the
sequenced large-insert clones to an average
resolution of 200-bp. This is accomplished by the
systematic introduction of objective quality
measures throughout the data production process,
from the physical mapping through to the shotgun
sequencing. 


<p>Detailed sequence-ready restriction-maps are
produced by the multiple-complete-digest (MCD)
method. These maps have proven to be very
accurate, with average sizing errors better than
1%. They allow us to both validate the large-insert
clones to a 200-bp average resolution, and to
confirm the correctness of the subsequent sequence
assemblies. The sequence production is
distinguished by an emphasis on long read-lengths
instead of maximum machine utilization. Data and
quality analysis are performed with the
Phred/Phrap/Consed system and average
Phrap-alignable read lengths are 735-bp.
Overlapping large-insert clones are finished
independently and the sequence overlaps are used
to estimate the single-base-pair error rate, which
has been better than 1 in 100,000-bp. We will
present data from a CONTIGUOUS 2-Mbp region
on human chromosome-7 (near 7q31.3). Evidence
will be presented to support all of the above quality
assertions.

<p>The Genome Centers at DOE's Los Alamos,
Berkeley, and Livermore National Laboratories
have merged into the Joint Genome Institute (JGI).
This reorganization is a significant undertaking
that is aimed at achieving economies of scale in
our genome efforts while also leveraging off of the
expertise available at the three sites. In the area of
genomic sequencing, the large majority of the
JGI's effort will be moving the a new facility,
located in Walnut Creek, California, in early to
mid 1998. This will provide a custom designed
space sufficient for the scale up of the JGI's
production sequencing effort in a factory like
setting, termed the PSF (Production Sequencing
Facility). Until this time, the production
sequencing efforts at the three laboratories will be
scaled up in place, while also working towards the
goal of finalizing a uniform production process for
use within the PSF.


<p>The sequencing approach at Berkeley has recently
been altered by the increase in the emphasis on the
up-front shotgun phase of the process, which
utilizes double end plasmid subclone sequencing.
Additionally, we have adopted the use of additional
bacterial strains for all of our subclone libraries
that seem to alleviate under-representation of
genomic regions due to cloning biases. These
changes are helping us to significantly reduce the
time required for the complete sequence of a given
physical mapping clone to be determined. Data will
be presented on the current status of a set of 16
human and mouse P1's, pac's and bac's that are
now in progress using this new sequencing process.

<p>Human chromosome 5q31 was chosen by the JGI
for large-scale sequencing because it harbors a
family of interleukin genes which are important
regulators of the immune response. Interleukin-3
(IL-3), IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) are clustered within 600 kilobases of
each other on human 5q31. Previously, we have
computationally and biologically analyzed the
available genomic sequence data in the 1 Mb
region of human 5q31 containing the interleukin
family cluster and identified 16 new genes, as well
as 7 previously known genes. We also performed
comparative mapping studies and demonstrated
that 13 of the human genes in the 5q31 region are
located in the syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 11. 


<p>Numerous experimental studies have indicated that
noncoding regulatory sequences controlling gene
expression are evolutionarily conserved in mice
and humans. Comparative analysis of human and
mouse orthologous sequences is a powerful tool for
identifying these conserved noncoding regulatory
elements. To facilitate the annotation of coding
regions and permit noncoding conserved regulatory
elements to be readily identified in the human 5q31
sequence data, the JGI has chosen to sequence the
1 Mb region containing the interleukin growth
factor cluster on mouse chromosome 11. 


<p>To date, we have isolated and begun sequencing a
150 kb mouse BAC which contains 5 complete
genes: IL-4 and IL-13 - genes with coordinated
expression in T-Cells; septin - a ubiquitously
expressed gene with complex alternative splicing;
and cyclin-like and KIF3 - genes which are both
predominantly expressed in the brain and are
physically near each other. Importantly, the
expression patterns of these five genes suggest that
human-mouse conserved noncoding regulatory
elements are likely to be in this 150 kb region and
identified by comparative sequence analysis.

<p>We have sequenced the human and mouse genomic
segments encoding the fibroblast growth factor
receptor 3 gene (FGFR3). FGFR3 is a member of
the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily and a
developmentally regulated transmembrane protein.
Mutations in FGFR3 contribute to a number of
significant human maladies. The human and mouse
genes exhibit significant similarity in terms of their
structural domains and genomic organization. In
both species, the gene consists of 19 exons and 18
introns spanning greater than 15 kbp of sequence.
The coding regions across the entire gene are 84%
and 92% identical at the nucleic acid and amino
acid levels respectively. The alternatively spliced
exon 8 is 95% similar at the nucleic acid level and
93% similar at the amino acid level. While the
sequence similarity of the introns is (on average)
less than 50%, the size of the individual introns is
very similar. The 5' flanking regions of the gene in
both species shows a similar high degree of
conservation. In general, the analysis of a 400 bp
segment preceding the initiator ATG shows only a
60% similarity. However, several common
transcriptional regulatory sequences are present in
both. Consensus binding sites for Sp1, AP2,
Krox24, and IgHC.4 are located in this region. It is
also worth noting that the position and spacing
between these sites is conserved in these species.
These data suggest that mouse comparative
genomic sequencing can be used to identify and
annotate significant functional domains in the
human genome.

<p>The terminal short arm band of human
chromosome 16 (16p13.3) is syntenic with three
different mouse chromosomes (11, 16, and 17).  At
least 8 loci define the syntenic overlap between
human 16 and mouse 17.  Less than 1 Mbp from
the proximal boundary of this segment is another
cluster of eight loci that comprise 21 centimorgans
of mouse chromosome 16.  Our human genomic
sequencing targets include this 1 Mbp segment of
chromosome 16 where the syntenic breakpoint
between mouse chromosomes 16 and 17 occurs. 
In addition, this segment overlaps at least one
unidentified locus of medical significance, CATM,
and contains the recently identified gene for
familial Mediterranean fever.  The CATM locus is
a gene that, when defective, causes congenital
cataract and microphthalimia.  It is clear from
previous comparative sequencing studies that both
structural and regulatory regions of genes can be
identified by similarity comparisons of human and
mouse genes.  In fact, our preliminary sequencing
efforts of this region of 16p13.3 have already
identified 33 mouse EST clusters with greater than
80% similarity to the human sequence.  These
ESTs are being used to develop primer pairs to
identify mouse BAC clones.  These mouse BAC
clones will be subcloned and sequenced at low
redundancy to identify and annotate potentially
interested regions of the human genome.  This
effort will be closely coordinated with higher
redundancy efforts at LLNL and LBNL in an
effort to optimize the depth of sequence coverage
required to identify conserved sequence segments
and presumably functionally important domains.

<p>The ability to sequence moderate-size plasmid
inserts (10-15 kb) using mapped transposons is
being tested on both microbial and human
sub-clone libraries. The transposon serves as the
priming site for initiating a set of bi-directional
di-deoxy ladders within the plasmid insert. The
priming site locations are mapped by automated
Southern analysis using a restriction digest that
releases the insert from the vector, while cutting in
the center of the transposon. The inserts propagate
on a vector designed to maintain the plasmid at a
few copies per cell, while enabling efficient DNA
purification after temperature-induced runaway
plasmid replication. Sub-clone libraries are built in
a multiplex family of this vector backbone, where
each vector attaches unique sequence tags to the
insert for use in mapping. Automated
Hybridization and Imaging Instruments (AHII) are
used to sequentially probe for the mapping tags.
These instruments are fully automated devices for
detecting enzyme-linked fluorescence from DNA
hybrids on nylon membranes, and are used in the
mapping and sequencing phase of the project


<p>We are in the process of using the transposon
mapping and sequencing technique to complete the
2.1 Mb genomic sequence of <I>Pyrococcus furiosus</I>
(DSM 3638), a hyperthermophilic heterotrophic
member of the Archaea. This organism, isolated
from hot marine sediments, grows vigorously at
temperatures near 100<sup>o</sup>C. Its lifestyle is anaerobic
and it derives energy by fermenting peptides and
carbohydrates to organic acids and CO2. <I>P.
furiosus</I> plasmid and cosmid libraries were built in
a family of 21 multiplex vectors. These vectors
provide multiplex tags for both the end sequencing
and transposon mapping phases of the process.
End sequences were determined on 2875 plasmid
inserts and 400 cosmid inserts. The cosmid inserts
provide a global scaffold of the genome, while the
plasmid inserts are used in the primary process of
transposon mapping and sequencing. Overlaps
between plasmid inserts derive from the matching
of end sequence onto transposon sequence contigs,
and contigs are grown from re-feeding the mapping
process with inserts that extend or bridge the
sequence contigs.


<p>Common growth and DNA prep formats feed both
the mapping and sequencing process. Minimal
spanning sets of clones are predicted from the
mapping phase and fed to the sequencing process,
where cycle sequencing is performed on
double-stranded templates. A single hybridization
instrument is capable of imaging 1728 lanes of
mapping data in each eight hour cycle; with a
20-fold deep multiplex set, these instruments
acquire mapping data on 34,560 clones over the
course of a single, unattended run. The use of this
technique on the <I>Pyrococcus</I> genome is
demonstrating the robustness and cost-
effectiveness of using this technique. The use of
moderate-size plasmid insert libraries providing a
reduced clone feed and finishing information
results in a complementary approach to small-size
M13 insert strategies. This project is an alpha test
of methods, instrumentation and software under
development at the Utah Center for Human
Genome Research.

<p><I>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</I> is a hyperthermophilic
archaeon discovered from a boiling marine water
hole at Maronti Beach, Italy that is capable of
growth at 104C. This microorganism can grow
aerobically, unlike most of it's thermophilic
relatives, making it amenable to a variety of
experimental manipulation and a potential
candidate for a model organism for studying
archaeal microbiology and thermophilism.
Sequencing the entire genome of this organism
provides a wealth of information on the
evolutionary and phylogenetic relationship between
archaea and other organisms as well as the basis of
thermophilic nature of this organism. We have
constructed a physical map that covers estimated
2.3 Megabase pair genome using a 10X fosmid
library. The map currently consists of 96
overlapping fosmid clones. We have completed
sequencing the entire genome using a random
shotgun approach with the supplement of
oligonucleotide primer directed sequencing. A total
of 16,098 random sequences corresponding to
approximately 3.5X genomic coverage were
obtained by sequencing from both ends of 2-3 kbp
genomic DNA fragments cloned into pUC18/19
vectors using vector-specific primers. These
fragments were assembled into several hundred
contigs using the Phrap program developed by Dr.
Phil Green at University of Washington, Seattle.
Gaps and regions of low quality base calls have
been resolved using primers specifically designed
to extend the problem regions. We have
successfully closed all remaining gaps after a total
of 2,300 directed sequencing reactions and
reassembly. Our current full length genomic
sequence still suffers from low data quality: only
approximately 99% of the nucleotide sequences are
accurate. This is mainly due to the low redundancy
(3.5 fold) in random sequencing. We plan to
perform 2-3,000 more directed sequencing
reactions to polish the sequence to 99.99%
accuracy. We are currently running MAGPIE, a
WEB based system for sequence annotation, in our
UltraSparc server (date.tree.caltech.edu) and plan
to analyze and completely annotate the genome.

<p>This project is applying automated sequencing
technology and bioinformatics tools to the analysis
of microbial genomes with potential applications in
energy production and bioremediation. Efforts
have focused on two genomes in particular, those
of <I>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</I> strain
delta H and <I>Clostridum acetobutylicum</I> ATCC
824. 


<p><I>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</I> is a
thermophilic archaeon that grows at temperatures
from 40-70C, and was isolated in 1971 from
sewage sludge. The complete 1,751,377 bp
sequence of the genome of <I>M.
thermoautotrophicum</I> was determined by a whole
genome shotgun sequencing approach. Analysis of
the sequence predicted 1,855 polypeptide-encoding
ORFs, 807 (44%) of which could be classified
according to function. The putative gene products
were compared with sequences from
<I>Methanococcus jannaschii</I>, as well as eucaryal,
bacterial and archaeal specific databases. These
analyses indicated that most ORFs are most
similar to sequences described previously in other
Archaea, but that there has been extensive
divergence between the two sequenced methanogen
genomes. Most gene products predicted to be
involved in cofactor and small molecule
biosyntheses, intermediary metabolism, transport,
nitrogen fixation, regulatory functions and
interactions with the environment are more similar
to bacterial than eucaryal sequences, whereas the
converse was true for most proteins predicted to be
involved in DNA metabolism, transcription, and
translation. There are 24 polypetides that could
form two-component sensor kinase-response
regulator systems, homologs of bacterial DnaK
and DnaJ, homologs of eucaryal DNA replication
initiation Cdc6 proteins, an X-family repair-type
DNA polymerase and an unusual archaeal B-type
DNA polymerase. There are 39 tRNA genes, two
rRNA gene clusters, one intein containing gene,
several repeated regions, two large clusters of short
repetitive elements, and numerous other interesting
features. 


<p>The Clostridia are a diverse group of
gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore forming
anaerobes that include several toxin-producing
pathogens and a large number of terrestrial
species. The latter have been used extensively for
industrial solvent production (acetone, butanol and
ethanol) by fermentation of starches and sugars. <I>C.
acetobutylicum</I> strain ATCC 824 has a 4.1 Mb,
AT-rich genome and is one of the best-studied
solventogenic clostridia. The shotgun sequencing
phase has been completed, with 4.9 Mb of
multiplex and 21.3 Mb of ABI raw sequence reads
(6.3 fold total redundancy) that produced 551
contigs spanning 4,030,725 bases when assembled
using PHRAP with quality scores. A total of 4018
putative polypeptide encoding ORFs were
identified and searched against public databases to
provide preliminary annotation. The finishing
phase of the project is currently underway utilizing
a quality-based finishing paradigm and a set of
integrated bioinformatics tools. The data are

<p> The ~900 kbp linear chromosome of <I>Borrelia
burgdorferi</I>, the bacterium that causes Lyme
disease, is being sequenced to spur the
development of an integrated system for accurate,
high-throughput, low-cost genome sequencing with
minimal human involvement. We are testing a
modified whole-genome shotgun approach, using
random 1st-end and directed 2nd-end sequencing
on a clone set with good physical coverage. A
network of linked clones is generated at relatively
low sequence redundancy, and primer walking on
linking clones is used to close the gaps and
complete the sequence of both strands. This
strategy can achieve highly accurate sequence at an
overall redundancy of 4-fold or even less.


<p> Two commercial fluorescent sequencers have been
used in this development phase, with the intention
of scaling up capacity with a capillary sequencing
system currently under development. Data
management and analysis capabilities tailored to
this sequencing strategy have been developed and
implemented, including software for managing the
sequence process, selecting 2nd-ends for
sequencing, assembling the sequence, and selecting
walking primers. The routine biochemical
protocols needed for Mbp-scale sequencing have
also been implemented. Primers for walking are
generated from a library of all 4096 hexamers, by
ligating hexamers on hexamer templates to form
12-mers for cycle sequencing.


<p> The <I>Borrelia</I> sequence is almost finished. As of
August 21, approximately 5400 end sequences and
2700 primer-walking sequences had been obtained
on approximately 2700 plasmid clones (average
insert length of 2.1 kbp) and 106 fesmid clones
(average insert length of 35 kbp), representing
about 4x sequence coverage and 10x physical
coverage of the linear chromosome. The sequence
redundancy was higher than necessary because of
extra sequences obtained during protocol
development. A single contig of approximately 900
kbp aligns with the published restriction map and
contains all but an estimated few kbp at each end.
This sequence is posted on our web site at
www.bio.bnl.gov and will be updated periodically
as the sequence of both strands is completed. As of
August 21, about 92% had been sequenced on both
strands and approximately 200 single-strand gaps
remained to be filled. Our sequence agrees well
with the sequence of the chromosome of the same
<I>Borrelia</I> strain determined independently at The
Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). 


<p> Software and database support for this sequencing
strategy continues to be refined, with the aim of
removing as much human decision making as
possible. Automation of sample selection and data
entry will greatly reduce sources of human error,
which cause more problems in primer walking than
in shotgun sequencing. A newly developed
single-copy amplifiable vector in which nested
deletions are easily produced should allow the use
of clone libraries of longer average fragment
length, improve sequencing efficiency, and help in
resolving repeated sequences.

<p>Virulent strains of <I>Bacillus anthracis</I> contain two

are known to carry the toxin genes (lethal factor,
edema factor, and protective antigen) and the three

organism (Cap A, B and C). The vast majority of
the genes on pX01 and pX02, however, have not

combined contain sufficient sequence information

studies on determining the size of the <I>D. radiodurans</i> chromosome (3.1 Mbp) and its
plasmid pS16 (46 kbp).  Determining the size of the chromosome was achieved by generating a
NotI restriction map by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE); the chromosome contains 12
NotI sites and pS16 contains 1 NotI site.  As a result of genetic disruption studies we were able to
resolve all PFGE bands clearly by eliminating doublets, thereby correcting a previously published
erroneous chromosome size estimate based on 11 PFGE chromosomal fragments - there is a 420
kbp chromosomal NotI doublet.  Finally, by cloning out the NotI sites plus flanking sequencing,
and using them as probes, we were able to align the NotI fragments into contigs using PFGE
Southern blot analysis.  These contigs are providing TIGR a rough framework on which to align
the DNA sequences.

In <I>Y. pestis</i> the majority of virulence factors required for the expression of Bubonic
Plague are encoded by the 9.6-kb pesticin (pPCP1), 70-kb calcium dependence (pCD1) and a
100-kb murine toxin (pMT1) plasmids. We have obtained the entire nucleotide sequence of the
9.6 and 100-kb  plasmids by employing a combination of in vitro transposon-assisted, and random
shotgun approaches. The 70-kb plasmid is nearly completed. Analysis of the sequences obtained
confirms, and has enabled the precise localization of several known virulence genes in these
plasmids. Blast searches against the databases indicates the presence in these plasmids of a large
number of newly-identified virulence-related genes with high homology to both near and distantly
related bacterial species such as: Shigella, Salmonella, Mycobacterium, etc. The presence of a
number of insertion sequence elements of the IS100, IS125 and IS200 homology groups have
been identified and localized in these plasmids. Other findings of interest include the identification
of pilus assembly protein genes, origin of replication, partition and immunity regions.  Results of
the work completed and analyses of the sequence data obtained will be presented.
