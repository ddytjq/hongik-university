According to a recommendation by the Commission, all foods and organisms that are modified more than 1% should be labelled as genetically modified. Industrial organizations warn of the high costs associated with the labelling requirements. A committee of the European Parliament will vote on the recommendations regarding trace ability and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMO) on 4 June 2002. In July 2002, the entire plenum of the European Parliament will discuss the topics.

 <strong>2002-04-30</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/3943">Genetically Modified Plants to Decontaminate Soils Polluted with Heavy Metals</a></strong><br />Many plants remove heavy metals from the soil, absorb these through their roots and transport them to the sprouts, where the toxic substances are deposited. These mechanisms are to be investigated and used to decontaminate polluted soil. The plants could then be harvested and incinerated in special ovens. The Swiss National Science Foundation gave a press report on this research area, presenting the results from Enrico Martinoia from the University of Neuchâtel.
