<p>We are using DENS (Differential Extension with
Nucleotide Subsets, see Ref.1 and the
accompanying abstract by Raja et al.) for
sequencing the genome of <I>Rhodobacter capsulatus</I>
by primer walking without custom primer
synthesis.  A cosmid library of <I>R. capsulatus</I> was
constructed and mapped with high resolution (2). 
Of the total 3.5 Mb genome, 1.4 Mb has already
been sequenced by limited shotgun sequencing
followed by conventional primer walking. 
Forty-eight plasmid subclones containing 5 kb
inserts were isolated from each cosmid and both
ends sequenced.  The resulting sequences were then
assembled into contigs.  In conventional primer
walking, approximately 100 custom synthesized
primers per cosmid are required to close the
sequencing gaps and generate the second strand.
Around 10 additional primers are needed to fill the
physical gaps between subclones by direct primer
walking on the cosmid.

<p>In primer walking by DENS, the conventional
custom synthesized walking primers are replaced
with DENS octamers (containing two degenerate
positions each) from our presynthesized library of
2,048 octamers (50% of all possible sequences). 
At the current DENS success rate of 62% on
dsDNA templates, the use of DENS is cheaper
than primer walking using conventional
custom-made primers, even though the latter yields
an 85% success rate.  Future closed end
automation of DENS primer walking, made
possible by the instant availability of primers,
should reduce sequencing cost by more than an
order of magnitude.  The results of the <I>R.
capsulatus</I> sequencing show that DENS is a viable
option.  Updated results on this pilot project and
implications of the DENS technique will be
discussed.

<p>DENS (Differential Extension with Nucleotide
Subsets)  is a technique used for template directed
enzymatic synthesis of unique primers, avoiding
the chemical synthesis step in primer walking (1).
DENS works by selectively extending a short
primer and making it a long one at the intended site
only. The procedure starts with an initial extension
of the primer (at 20-30C) in the presence of only
two out of the four possible dNTPs. The primer is
extended by 5 bases or longer at the intended
priming site, which is deliberately selected, (as is
the 2 dNTP set), to maximize the extension length. 
The subsequent termination reaction at 60-65C
then accepts the primer extended at the intended
site but not at alternative sites, where the initial
extension (if any) is generally much shorter.


<p>Until recently we were getting about 70% success
rate on ssDNA plasmid and asymmetric PCR
products and 62% on ds plasmids.  Now, we have
found that the usable template size for DENS is
not limited to several kb (typically plasmids), as
we thought previously.  It turns out that DENS
sequencing can be performed on cosmid-sized
templates on the condition that the sequence of
most of the template is known (as in filling
physical gaps).  Then the computer excludes
candidate priming sites for whom the chosen
octamer primers have alternative priming sites in
the known part of the template if at any alternative
site the extension crosses the failure threshold
(about 4-5 bases).  Of 17 DENS sequencing
reactions performed using Lambda phage as the
template, 10 worked well. 


<p>In addition, we have developed a novel version of
DENS that uses only one out of the 4 possible
dNTPs in the differential extension (either dCTP or
dGTP extending the octamer by 3 or more bases). 
One-dNTP DENS allows primer walking on such
a template as a whole cosmid, even if most of its
sequence is completely unknown.  What makes it
possible is that the probability of the occurrence of
alternative sites with long differential extensions
using a single dNTP is dramatically lower than
that of extensions using a two-dNTP subset.  Of
five octamer primers tested on Lambda using
one-dNTP DENS, four produced good sequences
at the intended unique sites.  The occurrence of
suitable priming sites for the one-dNTP DENS is
lower than for the two-dNTP DENS but is still
high enough to perform primer walking if all 4,096
octamers are used.

<p>DENS allows primer walking without custom
primer synthesis and each walk involves a two step
procedure.  It starts with a limited initial extension
of an 8-mer primer (degenerate in 2 positions) at
20-30C in the presence of only 2 out of the 4
possible dNTPs.  The primer is extended by 5
bases or longer at the intended priming site, which
is deliberately selected, (as is the two-dNTP set),
to maximize the extension length.  The subsequent
termination reaction at 60C then accepts the
primer extended at the intended site, but not at
alternative sites, where the initial extension (if any)
is generally much shorter (see Ref.1).  Both steps
involve thermocycling.


<p>Here we show an example of DENS primer
walking on three human genomic DNA subclones
of the 3-4 kbp length each from telomeric region of
human chromosome 7, kindly provided by Robert
Moysis group, LANL, Los Alamos, NM.  The full
length sequences (3024, 3473 and 3707 bp) were
obtained from both strands of each subclone using
dye- terminators and the ABI-373 sequencer.  For
these clones we tested an easy method for ss
template preparation avoiding plasmid prep of any
kind.  The entire insert of a plasmid clone was
amplified by PCR in which one of the two primers
was 5'-phosphorylated.  One of the two strands
was digested with lambda exonuclease
(Boehringher Mannheim, cat#1666908) which
selectively digests 5'-phosphorylated strand only
(Ref.2).  Using this method ssDNA template is
produced by PCR using vector-specific primers
directly from overnight bacterial culture.


<p>For the DENS reaction, we have optimized
parameters related to the stability of the extended
primers and used them for the selection of DENS
priming sites.  Upon this optimization, the success
rate of DENS primer walking using the ss template
preparation by PCR was 70%.

<p>Primer walking using conventional primers is
believed to be problematic when tandem Alu
repeats are present in the template.  In contrast to
conventional 18-20mer primers, DENS
(Differential Extension with Nucleotide Subsets,
see Ref. 1 and accompanying abstracts by Raja et
al.) uses octamers degenerate in 2 positions.  We
have found that DENS has an advantage over
conventional primer walking in sequencing through
tandem Alu repeats.  A single mismatch in the
octamer/template complex prevents priming,
enabling discrimination between nearly identical
repeats.  It is possible to walk through repeat-rich
regions by selecting hypervariable sites for DENS
priming within the Alu consensus sequence. 
Additional mismatch discrimination is provided
during the differential extension stage, since the
extension will be shorter if a template base is
non-complementary to either of the two dNTPs
provided (e.g. if dATP and dGTP were the only
nucleotides present, and a "G" were encountered in
the template).  Finally, the extended primer is also
destabilized by a single mismatch at the higher
annealing temperature of the cycle sequencing
stage.  All of these factors cause DENS to be very
effective at distinguishing similar, but not identical,
priming sites within a DNA template, whereas a
conventional long primer is less able to provide
such discrimination.

<p>Current methods for DNA sequencing require a
DNA polymerase to extend a primer with each of
the four natural nucleotides, as well as a variety of
analogs such as fluorescent and chain-terminating
dideoxynucleotides. We have been characterizing
the structure and function of DNA polymerases to
better understand and to modify those properties
important for DNA sequencing, in particular the
incorporation of nucleotide analogs and the
processivity of DNA synthesis. Our work has
focused on the DNA polymerases belonging to the
Pol I family, that includes T7 DNA polymerase,
Taq DNA polymerase, and <I>E. coli</I> DNA
polymerase I. An important advance in our
understanding of these enzymes has resulted from
our recent determination of the 2.2  crystal
structure of T7 DNA polymerase locked in a
replicating complex with a dideoxy-terminated
primer-template, an incoming dNTP, and the
processivity factor thioredoxin [1]. The incoming
dNTP fits snugly into a pocket formed by the
fingers of the polymerase closing on its palm and
the 3'-terminus of the primer. Numerous
interactions of the bound nucleotide with the
template base, the polymerase, and two metal ions
specify the correct base-pair in the active site, and
provide insight into the mechanism of
discrimination against analogs with modifications
in the sugar moiety (e.g. dideoxynucleotides,
ribonucleotides and 3' fluoro derivatives) as well as
bases containing bulky fluorescent substituents.
We are making use of this structure to construct
mutant polymerases that incorporate various
nucleotide analogs more efficiently that are
modified in either their sugar, base or triphosphate
groups.


<p>The processivity factor for T7 DNA polymerase,
<I>E. coli</I> thioredoxin, is located at the tip of the
thumb of the polymerase in a position poised to
prevent dissociation of the DNA from the
polymerase. It binds to a 74 residue domain in T7
DNA polymerase that is attached to the thumb by
a flexible tether. While this domain is unique to T7
DNA polymerase, it is a modular in that it can be
transferred to other homologous polymerases by
gene fusion to generate hybrid enzymes that have
dramatically increased processivity for DNA
synthesis [2]. The crystal structure of the T7 DNA
polymerase complex suggests that thioredoxin is
acting to stabilize the region it binds to, allowing a
number of critical basic residues in T7 DNA
polymerase to interact electrostatically with the
DNA backbone and thus prevent its dissociation.
We are carrying out extensive mutagenesis of this
region in order to further define the critical
structural features and to engineer new DNA
polymerases that have increased processivity.

<p> An ordered set of nested deletions whose ends are
separated by ~400 bp allows rapid sequencing
across one strand of a cloned fragment, using a
universal primer. Any gaps remaining after this
process can be closed by primer walking on the
original clone. Even highly repeated DNA can
easily be assembled correctly, knowing the relative
locations of the sequences obtained. We have
developed vectors and protocols that allow simple
and reliable production of nested deletions suitable
for such a sequencing strategy, from cloned
fragments at least as large as 17 kbp and
potentially 40 kbp. 


<p> We have made two single-copy, amplifiable
vectors suitable for this strategy, and have
validated and made reliable a previously described
method for generating nested deletions
enzymatically. In both vectors, clones are stably
maintained at low copy number by the F
replication and partitioning functions and can be
amplified from an IPTG-inducible P1 lytic replicon
to prepare DNA. A synthetic version of the phage
f1 origin of replication is located a short distance
upstream of the multiple cloning site. Vector
pND-1 is used primarily for obtaining clones by
transformation or electroporation; pND-2 has
phage lambda cos sites that allow efficient cloning
of 30-40 kbp fragments in a lambda packaging
system.


<p> Reaction conditions have been defined where
purified f1 gene 2 protein efficiently introduces a
strand-specific single nick in the f1 origin sequence
with very little rejoining. Large amounts of stable
gene 2 protein are easily obtained from a clone by
a rapid purification procedure we developed. To
create the nested deletions, the nick is expanded
unidirectionally into the cloned fragment by 3' to 5'
digestion with <I>E. coli</I> Exo III, the resulting
single-stranded regions are digested with S1
nuclease, and the ends are repaired and ligated
with T4 DNA polymerase and ligase. The Exo III
digestion is highly synchronous and processive,
and the deletion lengths are proportional to
incubation time. To prevent undeleted DNA from
giving rise to clones, the treated DNA is digested
with one of several restriction enzymes whose
8-base recognition sequences lie between the f1
origin and the cloning site. Nested deletion clones
are then obtained by electroporation. 


<p> Pooling samples from several different times of
Exo III digestion before subsequent treatment
generates a good distribution of deletion clones.
Growth and amplification of randomly selected
clones in 1 ml of medium in 96-well format
followed by a simple DNA preparation protocol
provides ample DNA for analyzing deletion length
by gel electrophoresis and for DNA sequencing
reactions. Imaging and sizing software is now
being tested for automated selection of an
appropriate set of deletions for sequencing. 


<p> Exploratory work has demonstrated the
effectiveness of this nested deletion strategy for
sequencing fragments at least as large as 17 kbp
cloned from a human BAC.

<p>We present a method, analogous to optical
trapping, which allows manipulation of DNA
molecules in aqueous solution. Due to the
induction of an electric dipole, DNA molecules are
pulled by a gradient force to regions of high
electric field strength. With the use of very thin
gold films and oscillating fields, molecules can be
trapped individually or locally concentrated. The
molecules do not become permanently attached to
the gold. Spatial control over the trapped
molecules is achieved because they are confined to
a width of ~5 mm perpendicular to the edges of the
gold films. It is possible to mix static and
oscillating electric fields in order to move trapped
molecules from one edge to another, or to make
them follow very precise trajectories along the
edges. This phenomenon may be useful in
microdevices for manipulation of small quantities
or single molecules of DNA.

<p>Energy transfer (ET) primers are markedly
superior to single dye-labeled primers in DNA
sequencing, and in multicomponent genetic
analyses, such as forensic identification, and
genetic typing of short tandem repeats.<sup>1,2</sup> We
describe here improvements in the properties of ET
fluorescent primers that enhance their value in all
of these applications. In designing improved ET
primers, we focused on the spectroscopic
characteristics most important for DNA
sequencing and PCR product analysis: the relative
acceptor fluorescence emission intensity and the
amount of residual donor fluorescence emission,
and on improving the match in electrophoretic
mobilities of the DNA fragments extended from
ET primers. Hung et al.<sup>3</sup> showed that
3-(e-carboxypentyl)-3'-ethyl- 5,5'-dimethyloxa-carbocyanine (CYA or C), a dye with a high
absorption cross-section but a low fluorescence
quantum yield, is superior to FAM (F) as a donor
in ET primers and that 6-carboxyrhodamine-6G
(R6G or G) and 5&amp;6-carboxyrhodamine-11)
(R110) can serve as alternative acceptors to JOE
and FAM, respectively, in ET primers.
CYA-labeled ET primers have stronger acceptor
emission and higher spectral purity than ET
primers with a FAM donor. The ET primer set
C10R110, C10G, C10T, and C10R with only
rhodamine derivatives (R110, R6G, TAMRA, and
ROX) as the four acceptors has superior
spectroscopic properties and gives results in DNA
sequencing with near-perfect match in the
electrophoretic mobility of single-base extension
DNA fragments both in capillary and slab gel
electrophoresis.<sup>3-5</sup> ET primers with CYA as donor
and a donor-acceptor spacing of 4-6 nucleotides
offer excellent acceptor emission intensities
coupled with negligible donor emissions. In
multiplex separations, this allows precise
quantitation of the ratio of the signals from DNA
fragments labeled with one or another of two
different primers. We have applied the two-color
ET primer sets C4G/C4R and C6G/C6R to
bladder cancer diagnosis based on electrophoretic
analyses of polymerase chain reaction-amplified
short tandem repeats (STRs) where the diagnosis
depends on the detection of loss of heterozygosity
at particular loci. The success of the analysis
depends on the accurate multiplex quantitation of
the amplified DNA fragments from two different
samples, normal and tumor cell DNA. Multiplex
analyses with the two-color primer sets C4G/C4R
and C6G/C6R allowed quantitative determination
of allelic ratios with a precision of 10%.<sup>6</sup> We
performed a quantitative comparison of sets of
primers differing in the nature of the
donor-acceptor combinations, CYA-ROX,
FAM-ROX, and BODIPY503/512-
BODIPY581/591. Variables examined included
the length of the 5'-amino linker arm, the number
of base pairs between the donor and acceptor, and
the excitation wavelength (488 or 514 nm). Of the
primers examined, CYA-ROX primers offer the
best combination of acceptor fluorescence emission
intensity and spectral purity.<sup>7</sup>

<p>DNA can be simultaneously amplified and
sequenced using a new class of nucleotides
containing boron.  During the polymerase chain
reaction, boron-modified nucleotides, i.e.
2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-alpha-[P-borano]-
triphosphates, are incor-porated into the product
DNA.  The boranophosphate linkages are resistant
to nucleases and thus the positions of the
boranophosphates can be revealed by exonuclease
digestion, thereby generating a set of fragments
that terminate in a boranophosphate linkage and
define the DNA sequence.  The boranophosphate
method offers an alternative to current PCR
sequencing methods.  Single-sided primer
extension with dideoxynucleotide chain terminators
is avoided, with the consequence that the
sequencing fragments are derived directly from the
original PCR products.  Boranophosphate
sequencing has been demonstrated with the
Pharmacia and the Applied Biosystems 373A
automatic sequencers, producing data that is
comparable to cycle sequencing. 


<p>The method has been improved recently by
streamlining sample preparation and by employing
modified boranophosphate nucleotides.  Sample
preparation is streamlined by implementing direct
digestion of the PCR products immediately after
amplification.  The base-specific PCR products are
combined and digested by direct addition of
Exonuclease III and Phosphodiesterase I. 
Subsequently, the digestion products are purified
by spin column chromatography, concentrated by
isopropanol precipitation, and separated by gel
electrophoresis.  The uniformity of the digestion
products is increased by the addition of modified
boranophosphates to the PCR amplification and by
the addition of Phosphodiesterase I to the digestion
mixture.


<p>Additionally, we have synthesized a
2'-deoxyadenosine alpha-borano-triphosphate with
a fluorescent tag attached at the C-8 position of
adenine via an alkylamine.  Experiments are in
progress to determine its ability to be incorporated
during amplification and its nuclease resistance,
and to develop a screen that will allow for rapid
evaluation of other naturally occurring or mutant
exonucleases. 


<p>The boron method may find use in applications
where high resolution of longer fragments requires
stronger signals at longer read lengths, because the
distribution of fragments produced by nuclease
digestion should be skewed to long fragments. 
Direct sequencing of PCR products simplifies
bidirectional sequencing and provides a simple,
direct, and complementary method to cycle
sequencing.

<p>Recent advancements in DNA analysis with
capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) have
included (i) the optimization of sample preparation,
sample loading and separation matrices for DNA
sequencing, (ii) the development of a scanner for
detecting separations in large numbers of
capillaries (~1000) in parallel, (iii) the
development and evaluation of new 3-color
extended binary coding strategies, and (iv) the
development of rapid and sensitive methods for
high-throughput cancer screening: 


<p>  (1) Four-color confocal fluorescence CAE
scanners using our standard flat bed design<sup>1</sup> are
being used along with energy transfer (ET) primers
for sequencing of mitochondrial (mt) DNA,
<I>Chlamydia</I>, and <I>Anabaena</I>. Twelve motifs of the
hypervariable region I of human mt DNA from a
Sierra Leone population have been sequenced with
an average accuracy of 99.7%.<sup>2</sup> Over 40 kilobases
of <I>Chlamydia</I> clones have been resequenced and a
8 kilobase fragment has been assembled with
99.63 % accuracy. Several genes from <I>Anabaena</I>
have also been sequenced as a part of an
undergraduate research project and fragments of
up to 8 kilobases have been assembled. 


<p>  (2) A capillary array scanner (CAE) capable
of acquiring four-color data at the rate of 4 Hz
from over 1000 capillaries has been constructed.
The scanner has a rotating objective which excites
and collects fluorescence from one to 1088
capillaries which are positioned in precisely
machined grooves (spaced at 260 microns) in a
cylindrical objective housing. Four-color data from
four photomultipliers is obtained simultaneously
with four independent ADCs. The acquired data is
stripped of non-sample gaps, averaged across each
capillary and also averaged across a variable
number of successive rotations as it is acquired.
The instrument has been designed to use
replaceable matrices introduced by pressure filling.
This scanner will be evaluated through sequencing
of <I>Chlamydia</I> in collaboration with Ron Davis'
group at Stanford. 


<p>  (3) New three-color extended binary coding
strategies for multiplex DNA sequencing have
been developed using ET primers.<sup>3</sup> These
three-color methods are found to be nearly as good
as traditional four-color coding methods with
sequencing accuracy rates of 99.6% and 99.9%,
respectively. Methods have been developed to
deconvolve the three-color data into the four base
concentrations. This three-color approach is the
first step towards the development of higher order
multiplex coding schemes for DNA sequencing and
other analyses. 


<p>  (4) Finally, short tandem repeat (STR)-based
bladder cancer diagnosis methods have been
developed using two-color labeling with ET
primers and CAE electrophoresis.<sup>4</sup> Rapid (&lt; 35
min.) separations are achieved on capillary arrays
using replaceable separation matrices and the
allelic ratios are quantitatively determined with a
precision of 10%. These methods provide a
significant improvement in the speed, ease and
precision of STR analyses.

<p>It has been recognized from the beginning of the
Human Genome project that in order to
successfully complete this tremendous undertaking
the development of new and improved technologies
for DNA sequencing would be required. We have
focused on several aspects of this technology
development from automated Front End sample
preparation to base calling of collected data.
Central to the development of this and any other
automated sequencing system is the electrophoresis
platform. To meet the electrophoresis throughput
requirements of our automated Front End DNA
sample preparation system, we have developed a 4
color fluorescent sequencing instrument
emphasizing long read lengths, dense sample
loading, and low construction cost.


<p>The system employs a 250 micron thick
cross-linked polyacrylamide gel, 10 inches wide x
24 inches long which is temperature regulated on
both sides. A scanning four color detection system
is employed to collect the emitted fluorescence.
Data is collected bi-directionally with one of four
bandpass filters in position per scan. Image
processing and base calling is performed using
GelImager and BaseFinder software packages
developed in our lab. 


<p>The system provides sufficient resolution to
base-call DNA fragments beyond 1000 bases in
length (albeit requiring high quality template
preparations and sequencing chemistry) and to
routinely deliver runs with 750 bases of useable
sequence (98% accuracy). The system currently
process 88 samples in parallel and can be built at a
cost of $23,000. Instrument design details will be
presented along with performance characteristics
(in combination with our analysis software) as
obtained through in-house sequencing projects.

<p>DNA sequencing as practiced today involves a
series of steps starting from isolating DNA from
the biological sample, cutting these into fragments
with convenient sizes, amplifying the fragments
biochemically, introducing a label for detection
while generating a nested set of ordered fragments,
separating the ordered set of fragments and
identifying the nucleotide sequence, and
reassembling the short sequence data into a
continuous sequence. Recent developments of
capillary electrophoresis, especially in multiplexed
arrays, show great promise for substantially
increasing the speed and throughput of the
separation and identification steps. The issue of
cost when combined with the other steps in the
whole sequencing process still remains. Our
project is aimed towards the development of novel
front-end strategies, whereby the speed and
throughput of sample preparation can be
significantly increased while the amount of manual
operation and total cost can be significantly
reduced. We will present our latest results on
multiplexed sample preparation in small volumes
without the use of robotics. This promises to
reduce the cost of reagents and at the same time
provide high-speed high- throughput operation.


<p>An integrated on-line prototype for coupling a
microreactor to capillary electrophoresis for DNA
sequencing has been demonstrated. A dye-labeled
terminator cycle-sequencing reaction is performed
in a fused-silica capillary. Subsequently, the
sequencing ladder is directly injected into a
size-exclusion chromatographic column operated
at ~95C for purification. On-line injection to a
capillary for electrophoresis is accomplished at a
junction set at ~70C. High temperature at the
purification column and injection junction prevents
the renaturation of DNA fragments during on-line
transfer without affecting the separation. The high
solubility of DNA in and the relatively low ionic
strength of 1x TE buffer permit both effective
purification and electrokinetic injection of the
DNA sample. The system is compatible with
highly efficient separations by a replaceable
poly(ethylene oxide) polymer solution in uncoated
capillary tubes. 


<p>We will present data from an 8-capillary system,
where individual templates are simultaneously
injected from standard microtiter wells. After
injection, a completely computer controlled system
takes the samples through terminator-labeled cycle
sequencing, purification, introduction to 8 parallel
electrophoresis capillaries for separation and
detection, and base calling. Scaling up to 100
simultaneous channels is straightforward. Future
research should allow starting from single bacterial
colonies injected into each capillary and the
nucleotide sequence identified in a fully on-line and
automated system, perhaps multiplexed to 1000 at
a time.

<p>As the Human Genome Project moves towards a
scale-up of its sequencing phase, it is apparent that
gel electrophoresis will remain the main technology
for DNA sequencing. Although slab gel
electrophoresis is currently the dominant
technology used in production-level sequencing,
recent rapid progress in capillary electrophoresis
technology suggests that it soon will have the
capability of replacing slab gel sequencer in
production work. At LBNL we have developed a
beta-test version of a 96-capillary system capable
of production level sequencing at increased rates
and more importantly, improved automation. The
system is based on an adaptation of the best
available technology currently being developed by
several laboratories. In particular, we employ a
sheath-flow excitation/detection geometry derived
from earlier work by Norman Dovichi at the
University of Alberta. Our system, fully integrated
from the assembling of the capillary array to
automated DNA sequencing, to base-calling, has
demonstrated the effectiveness of the sheath-flow
approach using 96-channel array, with a
separation speed of 700 bases/hour/channel. The
instrument's operation has been fully computerized
with automatic control of the laser, high voltage
power supply, data acquisition and processing. The
gel replacement and sample loading were nearly
automated, and the sequencing cycle time was less
than 2 hours. A standardized baseline protocol for
capillary coating and filling and sample
preparation has also been developed. Currently,
this system has undergone a series of beta-testing
runs in the production-sequencing environment at
LBNL's sequencing Center. By loading our system
with the sample remainders left by production
sequencing at LBNL and directly comparing our
sequencing results with those generated by the
ABI-377 machines, we have found that a
comparable sequencing quality has been achieved
by our instrument. Details of results will be
represented.

<p>Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is being developed
in our lab and elsewhere for high speed automated
DNA sequencing. However, while several
multichannel sequencing instruments are currently
under development by different groups, the
significant issues of robustness and high overall
throughput of the DNA sequencing analysis have
not been adequately addressed. We are developing
a fully automated multicapillary DNA sequencing
system, starting from sample preparation to DNA
sequence generation. To reduce the failure rate to a
minimum and, hence, increase the throughput of
such a system, proper care is necessary for every
step of the process. We have developed a robust
protocol for thorough purification of DNA samples
that includes both desalting and template removal.
This procedure also resulted in 10-fold increase in
the amount of DNA sequencing fragments
compared to conventional desalting by ethanol
precipitation or gel filtration columns. The
purification procedure is economical, very
reproducible and compatible with different
sequencing chemistries. Conditions for
electrokinetic injection of the purified samples have
also been optimized. With respect to the column,
we previously found that long read length
sequencing runs may be achieved using 2% w/w
linear polyacrylamide (LPA) with a molecular
weight close to 9 MDa. A new, convenient method
for high molecular weight LPA preparation using
inverse emulsion polymerization has been
developed. With this procedure, LPA forms a
white powder of unlimited shelf life and allows fast
and reproducible preparation of working polymer
solutions. Additionally, base calling software has
been improved to increase the accuracy of
extended read length (see a separate abstract of
A.W. Miller and B.L. Karger).


<p>We are currently working on a fully automated
multicapillary array DNA sequencing system,
which will include a robotic sample preparation
and purification system, separation matrix
replacement and sample injection automated
devices. We will present our latest results in this

advances will greatly increase overall throughput
of the automated multi-channel capillary DNA
electrophoresis system.

<p>A high throughput DNA sequencer is constructed,
where the instrument operation (e.g., sample
introduction, DNA separation, instrument
reconditioning, data processing) is carried out and
tightly controlled by the instrument computer. The
complete instrument consists of two units. The
main unit houses the optical detection system, the
96-capillary cartridge, the mechanical system for
sample introduction, and the associated electronic
controllers. The other unit is the liquid handling
module dedicated to gel delivering and capillary
reconditioning. The two units interface through a
liquid conducting tubing. In the detection system,
an air-cooled argon ion laser is efficiently coupled
with the optics to excite fluorescence from all 96
capillaries. The instrument is portable. In the
sample introduction system, a carrousel assembly
allows automatic processing of seven 96-well
sample trays without human intervention. 


<p>The high throughput arises primarily from four
advantages: (1) the instrument design that allows
complete automatic operation; (2) the use of 96
discrete capillaries, with which 96 separate DNA
samples can be analyzed simultaneously; (3) the
use of a high speed CCD camera that allows
simultaneous monitoring of fast separation in all
96 capillaries; (4) the use of dilute replaceable gel
matrix that minimizes the time required for gel
filling and capillary reconditioning. Preliminary
sample runs of 400 - 500 DNA bases per capillary
have been achieved, yielding 38,400 - 48,000
bases read per instrument run. Including the time
for sample introduction, separation, and capillary
reconditioning, the PATCO prototype is capable of
one complete run within two hours. This sample
analysis throughput is comparable to the demands
of the Human Genome Project. 


<p>The 96-capillary prototype will be available by the
end of the year. In the next stage, the instrument
will be scaled up to 384 capillaries for 4X
improvement in the instrument throughput.

<p>We are developing instrumentation for DNA
sequencing based on the use of an array of
microchannels fabricated on a glass substrate.
Arrays with up to 101 microchannels, 48 cm long
have been fabricated in plates of borosilicate float
glass. Since last reporting we have further
improved our microfabrication process to etch
channels of arbitrary width and depth. We have
etched substrates with 12, 24, and 101 channels
per plate varying from 150 - 200 um wide and 30 -
60 um deep. The microchannels are constructed
with two plates of glass (nominally 7.5 cm x 58
cm) which are fusion bonded. The channel plate is
bonded to a top plate that has the input and output
ports for sample introduction and buffer reservoir
interconnects. Channels of various cross section
sizes have been built and tested using low viscosity
solutions of linear poly(dimethylacrylamide). This
sieving media dynamically coats the walls of the
glass microchannels to significantly reduce the
electro-osmotic flow so that sequencing
separations can be done in uncoated channels.
Also, the relatively low viscosity of the sieving
media allows it to be pumped into the channels via
a simple syringe pump. This syringe pump is
coupled directly to a common output port of the
microchannel plate so that all channels can be
filled with sieving media in one simple pump
operation. A linear scanning confocal PMT-based
detection system is used to detect the laser induced
four color fluorescence from the DNA fragments.
The data acquisition and control system is based
on a Pentium class personal computer running
LabVIEW. Data compression and transfer, signal
analysis, and basecalling routines have been
developed in S-PLUS and C on a Sun
Microsystems Ultra Enterprise 2 server. Recent
experimental results of microchannels 60 um deep
by 250 um wide and having a 38 cm load-to-read
length resulted in an electrophoretic resolution
greater than 400 bases in about 90 min. for a 160
V/cm separation field. A 24 microchannel plate is
presently operational providing electrophoretic
resolution of 450 to 500 bases. Currently we are
building and assembling a 96 channel system based
on this technology into an "alpha-phase" DNA
sequencing instrument which will be networked
with the Sun for data analysis and base calling. We
will report on-going results obtained from it for
high throughput DNA sequencing.

<p>We have developed a process for the production of
microchannel arrays on single glass substrates as
an alternative electrophoresis technology to arrays
of discrete capillaries for DNA sequencing. This
technology approach provides a number of
advantages for building large arrays of
electrophoresis microchannels for DNA
sequencing. By fabricating the array of
microchannels on a single glass substrate, the
arrays of microchannels are very robust
mechanically and can be handled without any
special care. By means of photolithography and
chemical etching techniques the dimensions of
rectangular cross-section channels can be
optimized by making the channel depth thin to
minimize the thermal dispersion of DNA bands
while at the same time the channel width can be
made large to increase the amount of dye-labeled
DNA available for strong fluorescence signal
generation and detection. The detection of the
fluorescence signal is also made easier by having a
flat optical window over the channels through
which laser excitation of fluorescence occurs with
less scattered light of the primary laser beam to
contribute to the overall noise level.


<p>Microchannel arrays for electrophoresis with up to
101 channels, 48 cm long have been fabricated in
plates of borosilicate float glass. The channels are
constructed with two plates of glass that are 7.6
cm wide and 58 cm long and are fusion bonded at
650C. The channel plate is 5 mm thick and
typically has 12, 24, or 101 channels per plate; the
channels are 150 - 200 um wide and about 30 - 60
um deep. The channel plate is bonded to a top plate
that has the input and output ports in it. Two
different types of input ports have been tested. For
a 5 mm thick top plate, input ports 1 mm in
diameter have been ultrasonically milled through
the top plate and registered with the channels
before the bonding process. For a 1.2 mm thick top
plate, input ports as small as 150 um have been
fabricated(about the same as the channel diameter)
and these have been registered to within 20 um
accuracy to the channels before bonding.


<p>The patterning of these plates employs simple
contact printing with flat panel display industry
type photomasks onto standard photoresists.
Special apparatus was constructed to coat the
plates with photoresist and also to expose them
with a simple contact printing method. A critical
procedure was developed to eliminate microscopic
damage to the glass before processing begins and
to clean the glass at the beginning of the
processing. This special procedure was essential to
reduce the microchannel etching defects by many
orders of magnitude that would have otherwise
rendered the plates useless for high resolution
genome sequencing. Extensions of this fabrication
technology should enable very high(400 - 500)
channel count plates to be made that would, in
turn, greatly increase the throughput and efficiency
of sequencing instruments.

<p>We have developed a technique for automatically
aligning a microchannel plate with a scanning
fluorescence detector in a high throughput DNA
sequencer. An optical signal from each
microchannel can be used to dramatically reduce
the amount of data collected while further
eliminating the effects of hysteresis and velocity
variation of the scanning motor. While the system
can be run in a high resolution mode (~2800 points
per scan) for diagnostic purposes such as
evaluating band shape, the described technique can
be adapted for the collection of a single data point
per channel per scan. Such a reduction is
prerequisite for practical application to high
throughput DNA sequencing. The technique makes
use of the difference in reflection of the air-glass,
gel-glass, and bonded glass-glass interfaces present
in the microchannel plate. A thin piece of glass is
used to collect back reflected light from laser
illuminated microchannels and sent to a photodiode
for detection. This signal delineates the position of
the microchannels with a high signal to noise ratio
and is used as an electronic trigger for data
collection.

<p> Capillary electrophoresis through a replaceable
polymer matrix has great promise for improving
the speed and efficiency of DNA sequencing if
many different capillaries can be analyzed
simultaneously. However, illumination of the
interiors of multiple capillaries and collection of
the emitted fluorescence from each is complicated
by the cylindrical shape and small radii of
curvature of the capillaries. We have solved this
problem by using the capillaries themselves as
optical elements in a waveguide. 


<p> Refraction of light at the surfaces of a capillary
depends on the radii of curvature of the capillary
walls and the change in refractive index in crossing
each surface. With appropriate dimensions and
refractive indices, refractive effects can confine a
beam of light to pass through the interior of each
successive capillary in a parallel array. The
illuminating beam must be in the plane of the array
and normal to the first capillary, have minimal
divergence, and have a radius comparable to or
smaller than the internal radius of the capillary.
This condition is readily achieved by delivering the
beam through an integrated fiber optic transmitter.


<p> Losses of light due to reflection at each successive
capillary surface can be minimized by reducing the
differences in refractive index across the surfaces
while still satisfying the conditions for beam
confinement. Illuminating with coaxial beams from
opposite ends of the array also improves the
uniformity of illumination. Using commercially
available materials, it would be feasible to make
96-capillary waveguide sequencers that would be
expected to have only a few percent variation in
the intensity of illumination of each capillary
across the entire array. The fluorescence can be
collected by an array of optical fibers whose
spacing is identical to that of the capillaries and
whose ends are positioned normal to the
capillaries. This configuration allows simultaneous
alignment of all of the collection fibers. 


<p> A 12-capillary prototype sequencing apparatus
was fabricated and tested, validating the key
elements of this design. The capillaries are
illuminated efficiently with only 30 mWatts of
laser power, and the fluorescence is efficiently
collected by the matched optical fibers with little
cross-talk between channels. The collected light is
delivered to a spectrograph and the full
fluorescence spectrum of all the capillaries in
parallel is displayed on the surface of a CCD and
read into a computer about 3 times per sec.
Replacement of capillaries and alignment of the
system is very simple. 


<p> Samples are electrokinetically injected
simultaneously into all 12 capillaries from a single
row of a microtiter plate. A
dimethylpolyacrylamide polymer matrix is used in
uncoated capillaries. Our current preparations can
be used for about 30 sequencing runs per capillary
before performance begins to degrade. We are
developing base calling software based on
Bayesian analytical methods. The system currently
reads almost 500 bases per capillary when run at
room temperature, with a cycle time of about 2 hr.

<p>Our flow-cytometry based approach to DNA
sequencing involves: (1) labeling DNA fragments
with base-specific fluorescent tags; (2) suspending
a single labeled fragment in a flow stream; (3)
digesting with an exonuclease that sequentially
cleaves the end nucleotide and releases it into the
flow stream; (4) detecting and identifying the
individual cleaved nucleotides as they pass in order
of cleavage, through a focused laser beam. 


<p>We have implemented an optical trap to suspend
the DNA laden microsphere upstream from the
detection laser. This resulted in: reduced
background; improved detection efficiency; and
simplified sample handling. With this system, our
detection efficiency of labeled nucleotides is ~ 90%
and false positive signals from the background are
a few per second. Enzymatic cleavage rates with
Exo III are ~ 5 per second at 37 C on
fluorescently labeled substrates. Progress towards
a two color sequencing demonstration will be

<p>The limitation of current automated sequencers is
1800 base pairs/day, which results in the need for
4600 machine years to create the first finished
sequence of one human genome ( ~3 x 109 bases
pairs). A rapid laser-based technique for
sequencing of 10 kb or larger fragments of DNA at
a rate of 100 to 1000 bases per second is being
developed in our laboratory. Successful completion
of this would greatly reduce the time and effort
needed in the sequencing of the human genome and
other genomes. This new method relies on the
attachment of fluorescent labeled DNA to a
microsphere, introduction of this microsphere into
a flowing sample stream, and detection of the
individual labeled nucleotides as they are cleaved
from the DNA fragment by an exonuclease. In
order to increase analysis rates, an exonuclease
with a fast digestion rate is required.


<p>Extensive testing of commercially available
exonucleases in our laboratory has not revealed a
suitable exonuclease capable of rapidly cleaving
fluorescently-labeled DNA. This has lead us to
search for either mutant forms of exonucleases or
exonucleases derived from other bacterial strains.
In order to screen the numerous exonucleases, a
rapid screening assay based on flow cytometry has
been developed. Compared to conventional
techniques, this new assay is sensitive, rapid, and
requires no radiation labeling or separation. This
will allow the screening of hundreds of samples per
day.

<p>Our flow-cytometry based approach to DNA
fragment sizing involves: (1) staining a restriction
digest of DNA with a dye that intercalates
stoichiometrically with the fragments such that the
number of incorporated dye molecules is
proportional to the fragment length; (2) diluting the
sample to ~ 10-13 M; passing the sample through
our single molecule detection apparatus and (3)
measuring the magnitude of the fluorescence from
individual, stained fragments. A histogram of the
fluorescence intensities gives the size distribution
of the DNA fragments, i.e. a DNA fingerprint.
Samples containing less than a femtogram of DNA
are sized in minutes with an accuracy of ~ 98%.
We have demonstrated the applicability of this
technique for sizing DNA fragments as small as
212 bp and as large as 340 kbp. In comparison
with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for the sizing
of large DNA fragments, this approach is more
accurate, much faster, requires much less DNA,
and is independent of the DNA conformation.
Applications to the characterization of PAC and
BAC clones for DNA library construction and
identification of bacteria strains by their DNA
fingerprint will be described.

<p>We have shown that single-molecule fluorescence
burst counting is a highly sensitive method for
detecting electrophoretic separations of ds-DNA
fragments.<sup>1</sup> In previous work, methods for
optimizing dye labeling, laser power and data
analysis were developed, which enabled detection
of single DNA fragments as small as 100 bp in
capillary electrophoresis separations.<sup>2</sup> These
separations were detectable when only 50-100
molecules passed through the probe volume. To
further enhance the applicability of this method to
low level pathogen and mutation detection, we
have now successfully performed single molecule
detection of DNA separations in microfabricated
glass capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips. By
fabricating CE chips with a 280 mm thick top
cover plate and by using a 40X NA 1.3 immersion
microscope objective, the S/N ratio for single
molecule detection was enhanced by more than
two-fold over conventional capillaries. By
constricting the sample in the detection region to a
~10 mm wide by ~5 mm deep cross section,
approximately 10% of the molecules could be
probed by the ~2 mm wide focused laser beam.
Cross channel and separation channel dimensions
were systematically varied to optimize the injection
of the DNA sample. We have now achieved a
detection limit of 500 molecules on-column or 200
attograms/ml for 500 bp DNA fragments.<sup>3</sup> This
accomplishment is important because DNA-based
methods are becoming increasingly important in
environmental monitoring and in health care
diagnostics to detect trace levels of pathogen
contamination or DNA mutation.

<p>Mass spectrometry has important potential
applications in the measurement of molecular
masses relevant to the goals of the Human Genome
Project. Thin gels, capillary gels and DNA chip
technology appear to offer improvements in DNA
analysis rates over slab gels but "mass
spectrometry has perhaps demonstrated the
greatest near-term potential [to increase
through-put]." To the extent that direct
instrumental measurements of molecular size could
replace gel electrophoresis as a routine tool for
DNA-sequencing separations and general
molecular biology experimentation, a significant
saving in time could be effected. Electrophoresis
gels take hours to run but mass spectra are
acquired in seconds to a few minutes. Additionally,
mass spectrometers produce a mass measurement
compared to gel electrophoresis which separates
ions according to mobility, a relative measurement. 


<p>Electrospray mass spectrometry is an important
type of mass spectrometry applicable to DNA
analysis because it does not break apart DNA
molecules. For relatively small electrospray DNA
ions, the different charge states provide a way to
calculate mass but for large ions with numerous
charge states the calculation of ion mass is
precluded because the charge states are not
resolved in most mass spectrometers. We recently
demonstrated the direct detection of charge on
large electrospray ions as a way to solve this
problem so that the mass of large DNA ions could
be measured. 


<p>A patent application has been submitted for the
invention of charge-detection-mass-spectrometry.
More recently, we have significantly improved the
measurement capability of this technique by
implementing this detection system in a new type
of ion trap. The gated electrostatic trap consists of
a detector tube mounted between two sets of ion
mirrors. The mirrors define
symmetrically-opposing potential valleys which
guide axially-injected ions to cycle back and forth
through the charge-detection tube. A low noise
charge-sensitive amplifier, connected to the tube,
reproduces the image charge of individual ions as
they pass through the detector tube. Ion mass is
calculated from measurement of ion charge and
velocity following each passage through the
detector. Individual ions carrying more than 250
charges at an energy of 200 eV/charge have been
trapped for 10 ms corresponding to 450 cycles
through the detector tube. At this level of trapping
time, a theoretical precision for charge
measurement as small as 2 electrons RMS can be
achieved. The operation of the system was
demonstrated by trapping a 4.3 kilobase long
circular DNA molecule of bacterial plasmid
pBR322. The sodium form of this molecule has a
molecular weight of 2.88 MDa. A mass value of
2.79 +/- 0.09 (ave +/- s.d.) MDa was determined.
The accuracy of the mass measurements and the
speed of this technique suggest that this
measurement approach could be applied to the
routine sizing of cloning vectors for the purpose of
quality control of the cloning process.

<p>Nylon membrane is the preferred support for a
multitude of molecular biology applications due to
its robustness and retension of high levels of
bioanalytes. Chemiluminescent detection with
1,2-dioxetane substrates on nylon membrane is
facilitated by the enhancement properties of nylon,
but limited by high levels of non-specific binding
of enzyme labeled reagents. We have developed
polymers of quaternary amines for enhancement of
chemiluminescence intensity from 1,2-dioxetanes
in solution. These polymers also improve
membrane assays when added to the substrate
buffer. Poly(benzyltributyl)ammonium
chloride(TBQ)(SapphireAE II) and
Poly(benzyldimethylvinylbenzyl)ammonium
chloride (BDMQ) (SapphireAE I) are current
Tropix chemiluminescent enhancer products.
Various quaternary amine polymers were screened
to determine if membranes coated with such
polymers would exhibit superior performance
compared to commercially available nylon, PVDF,
or nitrocellulose supports. Due to the superior
chemiluminescent enhancement properties of THQ
(Polyvinylbenzyltrihexylammonium chloride), this
polymer was used to overcoat different membrane
supports. After overcoating with THQ,
biotinylated DNA was detected with a
chemiluminescent dot blot assay. Polyethersulfone
membranes exhibited the best performance in these
assays. Recently, we have collaborated with an
outside membrane manufacturer to bench cast
membranes with THQ polymer. These membranes
were subsequently tested by performing
chemiluminescent detection of biotin or fluorescein
labeled DNA in dot blot and Southern assays. The
results indicate that sensitive detection and low
background signal are attained on these
membranes. Development of a superior membrane
for chemiluminescent assays is of great benefit,
enabling more rapid imaging of signals with x-ray
film and electronic imaging devices (i.e. CCD
cameras).

<p>  The microfabrication of DNA sample
preparation, electrophoretic analysis and detection
devices is making possible a new generation of
high-speed, high-throughput DNA analysis
systems. Our early work showed that high-quality
fragment sizing as well as DNA sequencing
separations could be performed on microfabricated
capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips.<sup>1,2</sup> We also
demonstrated that PCR amplification could be
directly performed on our CE chips to make the
first integrated DNA sample preparation and
analysis devices.<sup>3</sup> It was also possible to increase
the throughput of these microdevices by making
capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) chips that
could carry out parallel genotyping separations of
up to 12 samples on a single chip in under 160
seconds.<sup>4</sup> Recent advances in the use of replaceable
denaturing separation matrices, in injection
methodology, and in channel fabrication now
enable DNA sequencing separations on chips with
single base resolution to =500 bases in only 12
minutes. Improvements in fabrication permit the
construction of larger defect-free devices on 10 cm
diameter glass wafers.<sup>5</sup> We have also developed (i)
novel injection modules for serially introducing
multiple (2-4) samples onto the same capillary, (ii)
elastomer sample well arrays for the facile loading
of up to 96 samples, and (iii) electrode arrays for
addressing up to 96 samples. These improvements
have led to the development of a CAE chip that
can separate 96 DNA fragment samples in less
than 8 minutes using 48 parallel capillaries, each
capable of analyzing two different samples.<sup>6</sup> These
analyses have all been performed by using
high-sensitivity, laser-excited confocal
fluorescence detection. However, to produce truly
portable high-speed microdevices it is desirable to
eliminate expensive and bulky optical components
and laser systems. Toward this end we have been
working on the development of integrated
electrochemical detection systems for CE chips.<sup>7</sup> In
these devices, the working electrode, formed by RF
sputter deposition of Pt (2500 &Aring;) on a 200 &Aring; Ti
adhesion layer, was photolithographically placed
=30 um outside the end of the separation channel
to avoid interference from the separation field.
Electrophoretic separations of neurotransmitters
were performed in under 100 seconds
demonstrating the speed, resolution and attomole
detection sensitivity of these devices. Indirect
electrochemical detection of DNA fragment
separations was performed by using the
redox-active intercalator
Fe(1,10-phenanthroline)32+ in the separation
buffer; transient dips in the constant background
current from free intercalator indicated the
migration of DNA-intercalator complexes through
the detection region. On-chip electrochemical
detection provided excellent sensitivity (=103
molecules) for rapid (=200 s) and high-quality
separations of DNA restriction fragments and PCR
products. This work is the harbinger of a paradigm
shift in the application of CE chips to genomic
sequencing and analysis.

<p>A flowthrough genosensor instrument for ultrahigh
throughput analysis of gene structure and function
is being developed. The core of this microscale
instrumentation is a microchannel hybridization
array, containing a library of thousands of specific
DNA sequences, immobilized within microporous
cells in a thin layer of silicon or glass. A nucleic
acid sample is passed through the microchannel
genosensor at precisely controlled temperature and
flow rate, and each porous hybridization cell binds
nucleic acid sequences that are complementary to
the immobilized DNA probe. The quantitative
binding pattern reflects the base sequence of the
nucleic acid strands present in the analyte and
reveals the relative abundance of different
sequences. The porous glass configuration has
several important advantages over the flat surface
DNA chip being developed by others: greatly
improved hybridization kinetics, superior detection
sensitivity, the ability to analyze dilute solutions of
nucleic acids, and direct detection of
heat-denatured PCR fragments without prior
isolation of single strands.


<p>The prototype genosensor system includes a
temperature-controlled fluidics module and a CCD
imaging system for quantitation of hybridized
fluorescent-labeled strands. A key objective in the
project is to develop important applications of the
flowthrough genosensor for analysis of gene
structure and function and DNA diagnostics.
Feasibility studies for key genosensor applications
are being pursued in collaboration with the mouse
genetics program at ORNL and with several other
organizations. In one application area, a series of
miniature "genochips" containing arrays of
genomic DNA fragments are being prepared for
use in gene discovery and mapping. Another
application area, being pursued via a CRADA with
Gene Logic, Inc. (Columbia, MD) and in
collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Trent (NHGRI)
employs flowthrough arrays of DNA probes for
transcriptional profiling, facilitating the discovery
of genes that function in specific biological
processes. A third application of the flowthrough
genosensor, led by Dr. Mitch Doktycz, involves
model hybridization studies with defined nucleic
acid sequences, aimed at providing a more
complete understanding of the specificity of
oligonucleotide hybridization, which will facilitate
intelligent selection of probes and valid
interpretation of hybridization patterns. A fourth
application of the flowthrough genosensor, being
pursued in collaboration with Dr. James Weber at
the Marshfield Medical Research Foundation, is
high throughput genotyping. In this work miniature
flowthrough genosensors will be fabricated to
simultaneously analyze thousands of biallelic
single nucleotide polymorphisms.


<p>In another approach, the ultrahigh surface area of
channel glass is being exploited to create arrays of
"microreactor cells" containing immobilized BAC
DNAs, for use in repetitive reactions needed for
genome mapping and sequencing. These reactions
will include: (1) Cycle sequencing reactions -
Sequencing primers, nucleotides and Taq
polymerase are flowed into each of the porous
glass "microreaction cells," then the wafer will be
sealed and placed into a thermocyler to carry out
the cycle sequencing reactions. Products will be
eluted and analyzed by Dr. Joe Balch at LLNL,
using his parallel microcapillary array
electrophoresis apparatus. This process will be
carried out in numerous successive cycles, each
time with a new set of primers, to acquire a large
amount of sequence information from each BAC.
The sequencing primers can be selected from
oligonucleotide libraries as suggested by
Ulanovsky and others, to achieve rapid primer
walking along the entire set of BACs. (2) Mapping
of expressed sequences in BAC libraries -
Libraries of BACs immobilized in the channel
glass array will be hybridized with individual
cDNA clones or ESTs to localize each expressed
sequence across the BAC array. This process will
be repeated with numerous expressed sequences, to
achieve rapid assignment of expressed sequences
to their genomic clones.

Micro-Arrays for Comparative

<p>We have developed a method of performing
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to
microarrays of genomic DNA clones (cosmids,
P1s, BACs, etc.) that permits high resolution
detection and mapping of DNA copy number
variations in the human genome (Albertson et al.,
this meeting). In array CGH, spots of cloned DNA
are arrayed onto a microscope slide and hybridized
with total genomic DNA from a test specimen,
labeled with one fluorochrome, and reference
genomic DNA labeled with a spectrally different
fluorochrome. The ratio of the fluorescence
intensities on each target clone is proportional to
the relative copy number of those sequences in the
test and reference genomes. Efficient
implementation of array CGH requires overcoming
several major technical challenges including
production of high density arrays, and rapid
quantitative readout and analysis of the
fluorescence signals. We have made considerable
progress in both of these areas. 


<p>We are developing a robotic arraying system with
a multi-pin tool to print DNA target solutions from
864 well plates onto fused silica slides mounted on
a precision X-Y stage. The pins, each made from a
segment of capillary electrophoresis tubing are
spring mounted on 3 mm centers. The upper end of
each pin is connected to a manifold by flexible
tubing to permit pressurization for printing and
suction for cleaning. We have demonstrated the
feasibility of printing targets on 100 um centers
using this approach, providing a density of 10,000
targets / cm2.


<p>Our imaging system was designed to provide: (a)
large field-of-view (1cm2, to match the print
format), (b) sufficient resolution (10 pixels per
target diameter), and (c) high sensitivity (accurate
quantitation down to single-copy DNA quantities).
A digital CCD camera and 2 high-speed lenses in a
back-to-back configuration image the sample at 1x
magnification. Fluorescence is excited using a
mercury arc lamp with filter wheel for wavelength
selection. A fiber-optic delivery system illuminates
the sample at a 45 degree angle through the back
side of the slide. A right-angle fused-silica prism is
used in "total internal reflection" conditions to
efficiently excite the fluorescent dyes without
allowing excitation light to enter the imaging
optics. A multi-band barrier filter was used in the
emission path so it did not have to be changed
when imaging different fluorochromes. We acquire
a DNA counterstain (DAPI) image and the test and
reference images with an exposure of several
seconds or less. Software automatically identifies
the spots using the DAPI counterstain and
measures the background-corrected fluorescence
intensities and intensity ratios of the spots.


<p>We evaluated the performance of the system and
analysis software using test samples made by
spiking 200 ng of total human genomic DNA with
0, 1, 2, 20, 200, and 2000 pg of lambda DNA and
a reference sample consisting of 200 ng of total
genomic DNA spiked with 20 pg of lambda DNA.
In this situation 3 pg of lambda DNA is equivalent
to a single copy sequence. We found that the
changes in the fluorescence ratios were detectable
from below single copy equivalent level, and were
quantitatively proportional to DNA sequence copy
number over three orders of magnitude.

<p>We describe a new type of DNA gene probe based
on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
label detection. Raman spectroscopy is a useful
tool for chemical analysis due to its excellent
capability of chemical group identification. One
limitation of conventional Raman spectroscopy is
its low sensitivity, often requiring the use of
powerful and costly laser sources for excitation.
However, a renewed interest has recently
developed among analytical spectroscopists as a
result of observation that Raman scattering
efficiency can be enhanced by factors of up to
10(8) when a compound is adsorbed on or near
special metal surfaces. The technique associated
with this phenomenon is known as
Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)
spectroscopy. The surface-enhanced Raman gene
(SERGen) probes described here do not require the
use of radioactive labels and have great potential to
provide both sensitivity and selectivity for DNA
sequencing. The SERGen probes can be used to
detect DNA biotargets (e.g., gene sequences,
bacteria, viral DNA fragments) via hybridization
to DNA sequences complementary to that probe. 

<p>The use of stable clone resources containing large
human DNA insets has opened new possibilities to
contig building for the Human Genome Project.
The objective of this research is to apply the SERS
multi-label technique for use in DNA mapping and
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) colony
hybridization. The technology is based on a system
that will integrate several concepts including: i)
multi-label SERS detection, ii) spectral multiplex
mapping, and iii) BAC colony hybridization. 


<p>Emphasis is on detection techniques that minimize
the time, expense and variability of preparing
samples by combining the BAC mapping approach
with SERS "label multiplex" detection. Large
numbers of DNA samples can be simultaneously
prepared by automated devices. With this device,
multiple samples can be separated and directly
analyzed using multiple SERS labels
simultaneously. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of the SERGen approach in the
detection of two gene probes simultaneously.

<p>Single-base polymorphism analysis of the human
genome on a large scale requires robust and
sensitive screening methods which are amenable to
automation and high throughput analysis. We are
developing a suite of microsphere-based
approaches employing fluorescence detection by
flow cytometry to screen for and analyze single
base polymorphisms. One approach being
developed for polymorphism detection is to
immobilize on microspheres proteins which
recognize specific DNA structures. When a
fluorescently labeled DNA molecule binds to the
immobilized protein, the binding can be measured
by flow cytometry. An example is the recognition
of heteroduplex DNA by the mutS protein as a
means to detect single base mismatches. To
analyze nucleotide base frequencies at a
polymorphic site, we are developing an approach
based on minisequencing in which immobilized
primers designed to interrogate a specific site are
used to bind the region of interest in an unknown
sample. The primers are then extended by
polymerase using fluorescent ddNTPs and flow
cytometry is used to read the frequency of each
differently colored base. Alternately, the ligation of
fluorescent oligonucleotides containing base
variation at the site of interest is used to detect the
base frequency at that site. Apart from the
advantages of sensitivity and low sample
consumption, the flow cytometric approaches have
the advantages of the potential for multiplexed
analysis using different color or size beads and
automated sample handling. Multiplexed analysis
could enable simultaneous analysis of base
frequencies at dozens of different loci, which
combined with automated sample handling could
provide a powerful tool for high throughtput
screening of single base polymorphisms. Supported

<p>Mass spectrometry offers the potential for high
speed DNA sequencing and other applications. In
addition to the development of sequencing
approaches, ongoing work in the laboratory is
exploring applications using Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry.
These efforts include the characterization of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products,
enzymatically produced oligonucleotide mixtures,
modified DNA and the development of methods for
the analysis of DNA large fragments. The analysis
time required is on the order of seconds, and is
made possible by isotopic resolution of each
component's charge states obtained using FTICR.
High mass accuracy measurements for PCR
products have been achieved for products up to
114 base pairs in length. As an example, the mass
accuracy allowed single base substitutions to be
detected with de novo identification of an
unreported base substitution (1,2). This approach
was extended to examine a multi-component
reaction from a single primer pair where a base
pair deletion was identified with the putative
identification of inter- variability within a single
bacterial strain (3). Recent efforts have focused on
increasing the size of products amenable to
analysis with a goal of providing comparable
"read-lengths" to traditional sequencing methods,
and have involved improvements to sample
preparation methods and the exploitation of
improved methods for dynamic range expansion.
We are also exploring the use of collision induced
dissociation methods with PCR products to
provide sequence information. This would allow
for direct selection and analysis of individual
components from within mixtures that may share a
high degree of similarity without cloning. This
alternative would not only eliminate that
time-consuming step, but also potentially allow
identification of low abundance products without
an intensive screening process.


<p>In this presentation the recent advances at our
laboratory will be described. These include the
development of new interfacing methods for
realizing greatly improved sensitivity and the
implementation of new high performance FTICR
that has been designed to achieve greater
sensitivity as well as resolution and mass
measurement accuracy.

<p>While a wealth of biological and genetic
information can be gleaned from properly-
designed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays,
currently-used technologies for analysis of the
resulting oligonucleotides all suffer from
limitations in speed, accuracy, safety, or
convenience. Matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI-MS) offers considerable potential for
rapid and accurate molecular mass determination
of biopolymers, such as proteins and DNA. In
order to achieve this potential, we are working to
improve the utility of MALDI-MS for
measurement of PCR product size. 


<p>The resolution (ability to distinguish products of
similar molecular mass) of MALDI-MS is
determined by both chemical and instrumental
factors. The presence of reaction components
necessary for polymerase activity, particularly
metal ions, causes broadening of the observed
peaks in MALDI mass spectra of PCR products.
Post-PCR removal of these metal ions and other
interferences can be performed efficiently using
reverse-phase cartridges in syringe-mounted or
microtiter plate formats. The wide energy
distribution imparted to biomolecules by the laser
desorption process also broadens mass
spectrometric peaks. Delayed ion extraction has
greatly improved the resolution of MALDI-MS by
compensating for this energy spread. Combining
these techniques, PCR products differing in length
by a single base can be resolved up to a total
length of 60 bases or more, and larger
oligonucleotides can be detected if single- base
resolution is not required. The design of PCR
products that are shorter than typically used for gel
electrophoresis is thus a high priority in improving
the applicability of MALDI-MS.


<p>Other important practical considerations are the
reproducibility and throughput of MALDI-MS.
Commercially-available instrumentation allows
robotic loading onto multiple-sample plates
followed by automated analysis. However, samples
outside narrow constraints of concentration, size,
and purity still require human intervention because
of the inhomogeneity of the dried matrix/sample
mixture. We are currently developing methods for
combining oligonucleotides with the MALDI
matrix to yield a homogenous preparation resulting
in a uniform signal at any point interrogated by the
desorption laser.

<p>During the past two years, we have used laser
desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) to obtain
the following major achievements. They are (1)
LDMS sequencing of ss-DNA longer than 100
nucleotides with DNA ladders (2) Direct DNA
sequencing without ladders (3)LDMS for
hybridization detection (4) STR detection for
forensic applications and (5) Rapid disease
diagnosis. 


<p>For conventional gel electrophoresis for DNA
sequencing, major steps include (1) DNA ladders
preparation (2) Separation of different sizes of
DNAs and (3) detection by either autoradiogram or
laser-induced fluorescence. Laser desorption mass
spectrometry (LDMS) can be used to enhance
DNA sequencing speed. One approach is to use a
mass spectrometer as a detector only. In general
multiplexing is used to increase the sequencing
speed. However, gel electrophoresis and DNA
ladders preparation are still required. Another
approach is to use LDMS for both separation and
detection. With this approach, gel electrophoresis
is not needed but the preparation of DNA ladders
is required. Recently, we succeeded in using
LDMS in sequencing single-stranded DNA with
the size longer than 100 nucleotides. With primers
for both strands, a double-stranded DNA segment
with the size up to 260 base pairs can be
sequenced. Both cycle sequencing and standard
Sanger's sequencing have been tried with
successful results. 


<p>Since the preparation of DNA ladders is somewhat
time consuming, it is very desirable to be able to
sequence DNAs without the need of ladder
preparation. We recently found that preferred bond
cleavage can be obtained during the laser
desorption process if adequate matrices and laser
fluences are used. We took this approach and
recently succeeded in sequencing an
oligonucleotide with 35 bases. This direct
sequencing by MALDI without the need to prepare
DNA ladders can be conveniently used to sequence
primers and short DNA probes. 


<p>In addition to the DNA sequencing, we also apply
LDMS for the detection of DNA probes for
hybridization. Preliminary results indicate that
LDMS as detector for hybridization process can
reduce the time and cost for DNA sequencing by
hybridization (SBH). LDMS was also used to
obtain short tandem repeats (STR) for forensic
applications. Clinic applications for disease
diagnosis such as cystic fibrosis due to the base
deletion and point mutation have also been
demonstrated. Different schemes for resolution and
detection efficiency improvements will be pursued
in the future to increase the sequencing and/or
analysis speed. Experimental details will be
presented in the meeting.

<p>Together with Bruker Instruments Inc., Genome
Therapeutics Corp., and Northeastern University,
we have developed a laser-desorption electron
capture mass spectrometry method to quantitate up
to 400 "Mass-tags" every 10 to 200 milliseconds.
Both DNA and proteins have been mass-tagged in
ways analogous to fluorescent-tags. The tags are
laser-heat-releasable electrophores. Advantages
over fluorescence include more numerous cleanly
separated spectral peaks, better detection, and
higher throughput. Applications to capillary
electrophoretic (CE) assays, DNA microarray
chips, in situ hybridization, and in situ PCR
imaging are under evaluation. The electrophoretic
applications are designed (but not yet tested) to
collect 100 sequence base pair equivalents per
second. To assess the capacity of our CE (75
micron inner diameter), we have obtained dideoxy
sequence data from a multiplex PCR sequence of a
mixture of 47 ds-templates. Another feature of the
Mass-tag is the 400 internal standards, which
should enhance the ability to computationally align
and quantitate 400 images for chip and in situ
applications. For the new complete microbial
genome sequences, we have developed chip and CE
technologies for systematic analyses of
DNA-protein interactions and competitive growth
phenotypes.

<p>DNA fragmentation is a major factor limiting mass
range and resolution in the analysis of
oligonucleotides by Matrix-Assisted Laser
Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry
(MALDI-MS). Protonation of the nucleobase leads
to base loss and backbone cleavage by a
mechanism similar to the depurination reactions
employed in the chemical degradation method of
DNA sequencing. In a previous study, the
stabilizing effect of substituting the 2' hydrogen
with an electronegative group such as hydroxyl or
fluorine was investigated. These 2' substitutions
stabilized the N-glycosidic linkage, blocking base
loss and subsequent backbone cleavage. For such
chemical modifications to be of practical
significance, it would be useful to be able to
employ the corresponding 2'-modified nucleoside
triphosphates in the polymerase-directed synthesis
of DNA. This would provide an avenue to the
preparation of 2'-modified PCR fragments and
dideoxy sequencing ladders stablilized for MALDI
analysis. In this paper methods are described for
the polymerase-directed synthesis of 2'-fluoro
modified DNA, using commercially available
2'-fluoronucleoside triphosphates. The ability of a
number of DNA and RNA polymerases as well as
reverse transcriptase to incorporate the 2'-fluoro
analogs was tested. Four thermostable DNA
polymerases (Pfu (exo-), Vent (exo-), Deep Vent
(exo-) and UlTma) were found that were able to
incorporate 2'-fluoronucleotides with reasonable
efficiency. In order to perform Sanger sequencing
reactions, the enzymes' ability to incorporate
dideoxy terminators in conjunction with the
2'-fluoronucleotides was evaluated. UlTma DNA
polymerase was found to be the best of the
enzymes tested for this purpose. MALDI analysis
of enzymatically produced 2'-fluoro modified DNA
using the matrix 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid
showed no base loss or backbone fragmentation, in
contrast to the extensive fragmentation evident
with unmodified DNA of the same sequence.

<P>
The Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM-HGSC) is scaling
with the aim of completing 15 Mb of human genomic DNA in the period until April 1998, using a
modified shotgun strategy.  In order to make this process more efficient, innumerable aspects of
the shotgun sequencing process have been optimized and streamlined, providing a good test of
this sequencing approach for analyzing large fragments (>50 kb).  We routinely now complete
genomic fragments using less than 20 reads per kilobase of DNA.
<P>
In order to efficiently sequence short (1 - 5 kb) DNA fragments we have devised another shotgun
based strategy entitled Concatenation cDNA Sequencing (CCS).  CCS has been applied to the
joining of multiple independent cDNA molecules to form long concatemers, and then generation
of shotgun libraries.  The libraries are then sequenced in a similar manner to cosmid, BAC or PAC
libraries and the sequences of the cDNA molecules are resolved as individual contigs in the final
computer assemblies.
<P> 
More than 500 cDNA full insert sequences from Soares libraires have now been initiated in
libraries averaging 50 inserts.  More than 150 cDNAs have been finished and submitted to
GenBank, and 250 are in closure. The complete sequences show that the method is as efficient as
when sequencing comparable clones with the same total length as the combined cDNAs, and
libraries have been competed with as few as 14 reads/kb. Simplified methods for pooling cDNA
preparations have been developed, and problems associated with individual cDNAs that evade
concatenation have been solved.  Our aim is to complete 1,000 cDNAs insert sequences within
1998.

acquisition scheme includes a robot with a custom-designed modular print head which deposits
cDNA onto glass slides and a commercial fluorescent imaging machine which detects array
hybridizations.  Software to locate and quantitate samples in the image has also been developed. 
The software generates a list of expression levels for each gene and produces an estimate of  the
fluorescence background local to each sample spot on the array.  We have statistically
characterized the performance of the array process so that each measured expression level also
has an associated confidence metric.  This metric reflects the measurement error in the expression
levels of each gene and includes the deviation in identical experiments performed several times. 
Variation is due to error in the array robotics, DNA hybridization and attachment chemistry,
mRNA sample preparation, fluorescence detection, and naturally occurring expression differences
between separate RNA samples.  A series of known test samples was deposited and analyzed
using the array system in order to characterize each area of variation.  Future work will focus on
an in-depth analysis of the complex expression data.  This analysis includes formulation of a
general computer model of gene transcription and implementation of an algorithm to predict
biochemical pathways from transcription rate data.

Over the last three years we have developed and put into full production a number of automated
systems for DNA purification, DNA sequencing set-up and processes involved in high throughput
genome analysis. Much of our recent work was described in Hawkins et al Science 276: 1887-
1889.  
<P>
<B>Methods and Protocols.</b>  We have continued to develop applications for Solid-Phase
Reversible Immobilization1 (SPRI) to extend to M13 and PCR2 product isolation and
purification. We have also demonstrated the use of SPRI for the clean-up/ desalting of
Dye-Primer and Dye-terminator sequencing chemistries, an approach which not only helps with
automation but also has led to improved results with capillary and thin slab gel electrophoresis
systems.
<P>
<B>The Sequatron Systems.</b> The initial Sequatron system consisted of a CRS A255 arm
running along a 4M track to service a number of devices such as XYZ robots, thermal cyclers and
plate washers. This Sequatron was in full production at the Whitehead Institute Genome Center
for one year and purified and sequenced over 400,000 M13 and PCR products. This system was
then taken out of commission in favor of a smaller, modular system. The Sequatron II systems
consisted of a CRS A455 arm on a 5 foot x 5 foot table3. Two systems were put into full
production, one for DNA purification from M13 and PCR products, and the other for the set-up,
thermal cycling and pooling of DNA sequencing reactions. Both systems had throughput of over
16,000 samples per 24-hour period.
<P>
<B>Next Generation Systems.</b> The latest work has centered on the development of
integrated systems based on nano-liter reaction volumes. Working with the Packard BioChip
Processor, we have shown feasibility of using piezo electric methods for small-scale PCR and
Sequencing reactions. These reactions can then be automatically loaded into the CuraGen Niagara
DNA sequencer or onto a MALDI-TOF Mass Spec system. This new system is currently being
designed. <P>

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has become a valuable technique for identification of
gross changes in DNA copy number (duplications or deletions) in solid tumor samples.  Using
current data analysis methods, red and green fluorescence profiles are obtained for all
chromosomes, and green:red ratio profiles are computed from these.  An increase or decrease in
this ratio is scored as a duplication or deletion respectively.
<P>
Here, we present an alternative approach to CGH data analysis.  By converting digital images to
Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file format, it was possible to take advantage of the wide variety
of data analysis methods which have been developed for flow cytometry data.  By generating
pixel-by-pixel bivariate displays of image data, populations of pixels containing increased or
decreased green fluorescence could be readily identified.  By gating on these subpopulations, a
reprocessed image was generated, showing only those areas of the chromosomes where
aberrations are present. Duplications were false-colored in green and deletions in red. It was thus
only necessary to analyze those chromosomes showing red or green areas on the reprocessed
image.  By examining these chromosomes using second-derivative analysis of the DAPI intensity
profile, it was possible to assess the cytogenetic band locations of these aberrations. This
approach can be easily implemented in laboratories performing CGH analysis, and represents a
less computation-intensive and potentially more rapid method for screening of chromosome
aberrations.
