      <P>In the spring of 2000, I was doubly blessed to both have the
      honor to graduate from Clemson University and acquire my first
      sports car. In the year-and-a-half since, I have enjoyed both.
      This past April, my birthday present was to finally bite the
      bullet and give the Driver's Education scene a thorough checking-out.
      While I had<FONT SIZE="+2"><IMG SRC="Images/mikefinish.JPG"

      done some NASCAR and vehicle handling schools in the past, I
      had never &quot;run what I brung.&quot; While this made me somewhat
      anxious, I was interested to see what happened when I took my
      bull to the china shop, or at least to Roebling Road Raceway.</P>

      <P>&quot;Oil, check&#133;lots of oil, check.&quot; Reliability
      was my primary concern going to the track for the first time.
      I had never driven the pretty 944 turbo this hard before, what
      would it do? While my oil consumption was moderate on the street,
      I had no idea what redline upshifts would do when brought on
      for 20-minute run groups. As required, I had the car inspected
      before leaving and was instructed to keep the oil slightly overfilled
      and I should be fine. This helped to ease my fears of rebuilding
      an engine and allowed me to focus on the part that would make
      help me to best improve my skills-my brain.</P>

      <P>Day 1 at the track started at 7AM. A driver's meeting followed
      a short tech inspection. So, there they were, all standing around
      me, the pros, guys who knew how to drive well. I needed to learn
      from them. Out of that crowd stepped my instructor, Dave Gross,
      who had a car similar to mine. 'All the better to instruct you
      with, my dear.' The camaraderie of the driver's meeting was followed
      by the orientation for the beginners-the green group.</P>

      <P>On the ski slopes, beginners must stick to the trails marked
      with green dots, and likewise, I was given a green dot to place
      on my windshield. The educational meeting was probably the most
      important part of the green group experience. This set the tone
      for what was about to happen. We had to be safe, serious and
      receptive to criticism and this new experience. With the explanations
      of oversteer and heel-and-toe came the warning to stay &quot;cool&quot;
      and in control at all times.</P>

      <P>That first day was all about the Line. There is only one Line,
      a line you never drive. The Line is too perfect for mortal man,
      but we must try to stay as close as possible, for only then will
      we enjoy the smoothest, fastest lap possible. As the laps accumulated,
      I began to grasp the Line well, and I began to appreciate the
      capability of the car.</P>

      <P>While the Line came fairly easily, other things did not. The
      way I was getting around the track was like connect-the-dots.
      For instance, I would drive from the spot of asphalt I used to
      mark my turn-in, and then over to the rumble strips at the apex,
      then back over to the spot I knew to be the exit of the turn.
      These little spots had been burned into my mind from my first
      run on the track and I felt I had the line down. Dave knew there
      was much more to driving than the Line, though, and he challenged
      me to better use my eyes and hands.</P>

      <P>Under Dave's guidance I realized that I had not be driving
      the track; I had only been driving from point-to-point, only
      looking at the pavement just in front of the hood. On the street,
      this would not work; you must look ahead and anticipate! This
      was the change I had to make. I fashioned a sign that read &quot;Look
      UP Stupid!!&quot; and affixed it to the dash. As Dave explained
      to me, when you begin to look up you can see the whole area of
      the track that you're on and the apexes you must try to reach.
      I had driven on a racetrack the entire previous day and not looked
      where I was going!</P>

      <P>When Stupid here finally began to look up, I could tell that
      my driving had improved and I was faster. I was also safer, simply
      because looking up brought all the flag stands into my peripheral
      visual field. This breakthrough was when, on a particular lap
      during the second day, Dave made me count the number of flag
      stands. Amazingly, some of them I had not really noticed before!</P>

      <P>As Sunday drew to a close, I was appreciative of all the effort
      Dave and the entire Florida Crown Region group had done to make
      my first track session safe and successful. The product of shared
      Porsche enthusiasm is truly a great thing. I cannot wait to return
      and continue my instruction; I have lots left to learn! </P>
