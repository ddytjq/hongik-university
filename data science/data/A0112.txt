              bills, cheques or instruments and to exercise in its favour all 
              rights appertaining to such instruments.</li>
            <li>The Bank assumes no responsibility or liability for the value

              the relevant Account on the correct value date and paid funds away 
              via its correspondent(s) on the correct value date. The Bank assumes 
              no responsibility for mail or other communication delays, external 
              clearing system lead times, processing times or for any loss (direct

              are uncleared and You have withdrawn funds subsequent to the Bank 
              crediting the Account with the said uncleared funds and such withdrawal 
              has caused the Account to become overdrawn (or the amount by which 
              the Account is overdrawn increased) or falls below any minimum balance 
              specified by the Bank, then You shall on demand pay to the Bank 
              an amount equal to the amount of the said uncleared funds. This 
              applies to all funds received whether by cheque or telegraphic transfer 
              or otherwise. The rules of any clearing system in the money centre(s) 
              through which funds ultimately are given cleared status will be

            <li> Interest will accrue and is calculated at the applicable rate 
              (which may be amended from time to time) on the available balance. 
              Tiered rates of interest may be paid on that amount (if any). Interest 
              is credited to Your Account as stipulated in the specific Terms 
              and Conditions for that Account. Details of the tiers and the applicable 
              rates are available on request.</li>
            <li>Interest payments are calculated gross and paid net of basic rate 
              income tax. Interest may be paid gross if You are not ordinarily 
              resident in the UK and You satisfactorily complete a declaration 
              of non-residence (NOR Form), or if You are ordinarily resident but 
              not liable to UK income tax and You complete an R85 Form. This clause 
              may be varied to take account of changes in tax law or Inland Revenue 
              requirements.</li>
            <li>In the case of joint Accounts, interest may be paid net for one 
              Account Holder and gross for the other, subject to receipt of the 
              required documentation.</li>
            <li>The Bank shall not pay any interest on any cheque or other payment 
              which is not paid.<br>

              held in a different currency, the Bank may convert it to the currency 
              of the Account at the Bank&#146;s prevailing rate of exchange.</li>
            <li>Any transaction in a currency which is not in the currency of 
              the Account, for example if You use Your Citicard to acquire goods, 
              services or currency abroad, will be converted by the Bank into 
              the currency of the Account at the Bank&#146;s prevailing rate of 
              exchange. The Bank may charge a fee. There may be delay before a

            <li>Citicards cannot be held jointly. For joint Accounts a separate 
              Citicard will be issued to each Account Holder.</li>
            <li>You must keep Your Citicard safe. A Citicard may only be used 
              by the person named on it and must be signed by that person immediately 
              upon receipt.</li>
            <li>A Citicard is valid only for the period shown on it and You must 
              not use it after the expiry date or after it has been cancelled.</li>
            <li>This clause applies where the Account is a Sterling Current Account 
              and Your Citicard is to be used as a Debit Card in relation to that 
              Account. (Your Citicard cannot be used as a Debit Card in relation 
              to any Account which is not a Sterling Current Account.) If Your 
              Citicard is a Debit Card it may be used to make or authorise payments 
              from the Account to authorised retailers for goods or services as 
              long as You have a sufficient Available Balance to cover the transaction. 
              Refunds are only credited to Your Account by the Bank once both 
              a proper voucher or verification and the funds are received. You 
              must pay the Bank on each Banking Day by a single payment the full 
              amount falling due in respect of Debit Card transactions (i.e. goods 
              or services paid for using Your Citicard) since the previous Banking 
              Day. The Bank will debit that payment to the Account (i.e. Your 
              Sterling Current Account). Debit Card transactions will be shown 
              separately on Your Account.</li>
            <li>The Bank shall not be liable if any retailer, bank, terminal or 
              machine does not accept Your Citicard.</li>
            <li>The Bank may terminate or suspend Your right to use a Citicard 
              for any purpose. Confirmation of this will be sent in writing to 
              Your specified address. If required to do so, You must return Your 
              Citicard immediately to the Bank.</li>
            <li>When returning a Citicard, You must cut the card in half through 
              the magnetic strip.</li>
            <li>Citicards will remain the property of the Bank.</li>

              collected, stored and communicated for processing. Such processing 
              may include identifying and account balance information and will, 
              in whole or in part, be performed electronically. In addition, transaction 
              processing may be performed by other entities either in the country 
              where You used the ATM or elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Your use of Your Citicard at an ATM outside the UK shall constitute

              of identifying and account balance information by any means necessary 
              for the Bank to maintain appropriate transaction and account records;

              in any networks that We use to process details of Your Account and 
              transaction information and other data necessary to enable Your

            <li>The obligations with respect to the Accounts hereunder are payable 
              solely at the Bank branch in the UK at which the Account or deposit 
              was opened and are subject to the laws of England (including without 
              limitation any governmental acts, orders, decrees and regulations, 
              including fiscal and exchange control regulations). The Bank shall 
              not be liable for unavailability of the funds credited to the Account 
              due to restrictions on convertibility or transferability, requisitions, 
              involuntary transfers, acts of war or civil strife or other similar 
              causes beyond the Bank&#146;s control, in which circumstances no

              therefor.</li>
            <li>All withdrawals made with the Citicard outside the UK constitute 
              a payment at the Bank, and remittance to the country where the withdrawal 
              is effected. The right of withdrawal is thus subject not only to 
              the laws and regulations of the UK but also to the laws and regulations 
              of the country in which the withdrawal is requested. Therefore, 
              cash withdrawn from an ATM outside the UK with the Citicard shall 
              be in a currency permitted at the institution which owns the ATM 
              at which the withdrawal is made. The equivalent in the currency 
              of Your Account shall be debited to Your Account at the Bank. Cash 
              withdrawals at an ATM outside the UK shall also be subject to any 
              exchange controls, regulations or limitations in effect in the country 
              in which the ATM is located.</li>
            <li>The Bank may at any time without notice, suspend or terminate 
              Your ability to use the Citicard at an ATM outside the UK and shall 
              not be liable to You for any loss or damage suffered by You resulting 
              in any way from such suspension or termination.</li>

            <li>If You use Your Citicard to make a recurring transaction and You

        <li> <b>Closing Accounts</b> <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>You may close the Account by giving at least 10 Banking Days&#146; 
              notice in writing signed by all parties to the Account and adhering 
              to the closing Terms and Conditions specific to the Account.</li>
            <li>The Bank may ask You to close Your Account, by sending You a written 
              request which specifies the period within which You must comply. 
              If the Account is not closed within this period, the Bank may refuse 
              to allow transactions through the Account. The Bank will return 
              any amount which it owes You to You at Your specified address, after 
              deduction of any interest, charges and fees due. The Account will 
              then be closed without any further contact with You.</li>
            <li>After receiving notice to close the Account, the Bank will cancel 
              any Standing Orders and Direct Debit instructions on Your Account. 
              It is Your responsibility to inform the payees. The Bank will not 
              be liable to You or any third party for cancelling any Standing 
              Order or Direct Debit.</li>
            <li>You must return to the Bank any unused cheques relating to the 
              Account and Your Citicard duly cut in half through the magnetic 
              strip, when You hold no other Accounts that utilise the services 
              of this card. In the case of joint Accounts this applies to all 
              Account Holders&#146; unused cheques and all Account Holders&#146; 
              Citicards except any Citicard that can be used on another account.</li>
            <li> In the case of closure of Joint Accounts, or where an Account 
              Holder is to be removed from the Account, the Bank will require 
              written authority from each Account Holder. Any unused cheques and 
              cards must be returned by the Account Holder(s) whose name(s) is/are 
              to be removed.</li>
            <li>You must pay the Bank any sum which You owe it in respect of the 
              Account including any sum which becomes owing after the Account 
              is closed.</li>
            <li>Your Account will not be considered as closed until all transactions 
              have been completed and the payment of all sums due from You to 
              the Bank has been made.<br>

            <li>The Bank may change its interest rates on Your Account and will 
              tell You of any change either by putting a message on Your monthly 
              CitiStatement or by sending You an e-mail or separate written notice 
              within 30 days of the change. When the Bank changes its interest 
              rates on Your Account, the Bank will update the information on CitiPhone 
              and its website within 3 Banking Days of the change.</li>
            <li>The Bank may change any fees or charges payable by You for the 
              day-to-day running of Your Account and will tell You of any change 
              by sending You an e-mail or separate written notice at least 30 
              days in advance. The Bank will tell You of the charge for any other 
              service or product before the Bank provides You with that service 
              or product and at any time You ask.</li>
            <li>In other cases, the Bank may change any other of these Terms and 
              Conditions and tell You about the change by sending You an e-mail 
              or separate written notice, at least 30 days in advance. If the 
              variation is to Your disadvantage then provided that You have settled 
              all Your liabilities under these Terms and Conditions, You may close 
              Your Account within 60 days of the date of the notice so that the 
              variation does not apply to You.</li>
