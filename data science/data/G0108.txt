<H4>1. Introduction </H4>

During the twentieth century, the standard greeting of introduction changed from “How do you do?” to
“Hi, how are you, and what do you do for a living?”  Work has come increasingly to dominate our lives
not only from economic need but also from a spiritual and moral perspective.  If we are what we do, ought
we not then to ask ourselves, how do we do?  Do we do, that is, do we pursue our work, with love?
If so, love for whom, or what?  What are the ethics of vocation?  How do we choose what we do? <P>

As a teacher, frequently I am asked for advice by students who wish to know what it is like to pursue
a career in science, what the job prospects are, and whether the student is capable of success.  Usually
I advise students to follow their hearts more than their minds.  “Do what you love.”  From love flow
enthusiasm, passion, drive, and perseverance, all qualities that contribute to success in a demanding
vocation.  Of course one also needs particular talents, but love usually turns elsewhere if the talents are
insufficient.  If love exceeds talent, the result is no less satisfactory: an amateur, one who does something
purely out of love. <P>
 
Rarely do ethical questions of vocation come up between my students and myself.  However, they arose
in my own student days, and they have returned in mid-life as I contemplate more broadly my own calling
in life.  As we will see, love - the foundation of Christian ethics - plays a significant role in the ethics of vocation. <P>

The word vocation comes for the Latin <i>vocare</i>, to call.  Its usage originates in the biblical
calling of God to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to the New Testament calling of disciples by Christ.
Originally a term restricted to a strictly religious station in life, vocation has become secularized to
mean occupation.  The subject of vocation has a strong place in theology.  However, its
consideration in secular philosophy and ethics appears to be more limited.  In my own brief study
of ethics, I have not seen the question of vocation raised outside of the context of Christian normative
ethics.  While my essay here is grounded in the Protestant worldview, I suspect that the ethics of
vocation is of broader philosophical and practical interest.  It may also cast light on the dialogue
between religion and science. <P>

In his Gifford lectures on Natural Theology published in 1934, William Temple wrote, 
“…[W]e have seen sufficient ground for the conviction common to all great religious traditions,
that the whole universe, the whole process of the world, is grounded in the Will of creative Deity,
so that this divine Will is at once the source of world-order, and also the determinant for every
finite mind of its special place within that order and of the appropriate contribution of each such
mind to the life of the whole.  If this be true,  <i>the solution of the outstanding problems of
Ethics is to be sought in terms neither of Utilitarianism however ideal, nor of Intuitionism,
but of Vocation.</i>” (italics in the original) [1] <P>

Temple did not mean that a theory of ethics must be founded on vocation.  Instead, he was
concerned with the ethical practice.  In his view, “the chief practical problem of ethics is solved
not by volition but by conversion, so the chief theoretical problems are solved not by reference
to a Categorical Imperative but by reference to Vocation.” [2] <P>

This is exaggeration; a society in which conversion replaces volition would be either utopian or
totalitarian.  However, Temple emphasizes the link between ethics and vocation, and this will be
the central theme of my essay. <P>

A second theme is the dialectic between love for God and love for others as the foundation for
Christian ethics.  In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus reduces the Ten Commandments to two:
“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
mind.  This is the greatest and first commandment.  And a second is like it: You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” (Matt 22:37-40) <P>

In this essay, I will first review the history of ethical theory relating to vocation in the context of Christianity.
I will then focus on the ethics of vocation in Puritan thought and the role of theology and ethics in
fostering the development of Enlightenment science.  I will conclude with some personal reflections
on the relationship between science, ethics, and religion. <P>

<H4>2. Ethics and Vocation through the Reformation</H4>

In the ethics of Socrates and Plato, the improvement of the soul by contemplation of virtue was
the ultimate goal toward which all men should strive.  These ideas, and their implications for vocation,
were incorporated into Christian thought by Augustine, who devotes much space in
<i>The City of God</i> to a discussion of Greek philosophy.  In the Augustinian synthesis of
Christ and Plato, the classical triad of virtues - truth, beauty, and goodness - become part of the
Christian ethic. <P>

In his book <i>Fact, Value, and God,</i> Arthur F. Holmes writes that, for Augustine,
“God is truth, as well as beauty and good.  The love of truth, beauty, and goodness, then,
all draw the soul toward God.”  The classical triad of virtues becomes an expression of God and
of love.  “Love for God … is the inclusive, unifying, virtue that brings life into proper balance
and harmony.  The other virtues are functions of love.” [3] <P>

Here we see the emphasis on the first commandment, love for God.  In Augustinian thought,
love for God subsumes all other virtues. .  In his <i>Basic Christian Ethics,</i> Paul Ramsey
emphasizes Augustine’s views with a quotation from <i>On the Trinity:</i>
“Neither let that further question disturb us, how much of love we ought to spend upon our brother,
and how much upon God: incomparably more upon God than upon ourselves, but upon our
brother as much as upon ourselves; and we love ourselves so much the more, the more we
love God.” [4] <P>

Augustine’s view of love provides a strong vocational ethic for clergy, teachers, and, perhaps,
scientists.  In <i>The City of God,</i> he writes,

<blockquote>
“But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts - the love of God and the love of our neighbor -
and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to love - God, himself, and his neighbor -
and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavor to get his
neighbor to love God, since he is ordered to love his neighbor as himself.” [5]
</blockquote>

Plato’s student and successor Aristotle expanded the contemplation of virtue into a systematic
contemplation of God, Nature, and humanity.  His writings formed the basis of Western science
until the Enlightenment some two thousand years later.  They had a profound impact on theology
and ethics.  Incorporated into Christianity by Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle’s hierarchy of being
formed the medieval hierarchy of stations in relation to God.  Contemplation of God became
the highest occupation. <P>

The Reformation shifted the emphasis from God-love to Other-love.  In place of the classical triad
of truth, beauty, and goodness, Protestants placed self-sacrificing love, agape, at the crux of moral
virtues. Ramsey writes, “Whose good? Is the main, perhaps the only, concern of Christian ethics….” [6]
With a shift in the focus of one’s love comes a shift in vocational ethics. <P>

Ramsey faces squarely the relative standing of the two commandments of love (for God, for others)
in a section entitled, “Is love for God part of the meaning of Christian love?”  He writes,

<blockquote>
“Standing as they are, these two formulations of the love commandment threaten to divide
Christian loyalty if ever there is a difference, let alone contrast, between love for God and
love for neighbor.  If Christian love itself is divided into two sorts of love or love for two
different objects, disunity in obligation results, and frequently Christians have spoken of religious
duties due to God different from ethical values owed to man.  Christian ethics thus imitates
Don Quixote dashing off at once in at least two directions.” [7]
</blockquote>

Protestant theology resolves this question in favor of love for others.  Christ’s sacrifice on
the cross was the focus of Luther’s theology.  Luther broke with the Catholic Church in his
doctrine of justification by grace through faith.  Because of Christ’s love for others, the
Protestant is no longer required to pursue good works in order to achieve salvation.
However, good works follow naturally from gratitude for Christ’s redemption. Moreover,
the Christian has the moral obligation (and Christ’s Great Commission) to seek the salvation
of others, and to love his neighbor through works of good. <P>

According to Luther, the church was no longer needed to mediate between the sinner and
God for salvation, with profound consequences for vocation as well as theology.  In the
Catholic Church of Luther’s time, “calling” or vocation referred to the ascetic life of monks,
nuns, and priests, who withdrew from the world in order to gain justification for themselves
and those who remained working in the world without a holy calling.  Luther squarely rejected
this distinction.  He resigned his own monastic orders and he taught that all vocations rank the
same with God. <P>

A study guide for a freshman honors seminar at Augsburg College summarizes Luther’s
doctrine of vocation:

<blockquote>
“If we are saved by grace through faith and not works, then the world becomes an
entirely different place. It is no longer the realm where we try to placate a demanding
God. Moreover, ‘vocations’ are not limited to a special class of Christians who by the
supposed holiness of their lives have placed themselves closer to their Creator. Instead
the world is now the network of relationships where Christians become instruments or
vessels of the love that God has bestowed upon them. Thus all Christians have callings or
vocations whereby they live out their lives in the world.” [8]
</blockquote>

In Reformation thought, love for others becomes the purpose of vocation.  The ethics of
vocation is based on loving one’s neighbor as oneself.  The focus is on worldly needs,
not contemplation of God.  However, this does not eliminate the place of reason:

<blockquote>
“Vocation properly locates the role of reason in the Christian faith. Reason cannot be
used to comprehend a God who would die on a cross. As Paul says, this is foolishness
to the world. However, once one has come to faith, reason must be used in service of
neighbor and culture. The worlds of science, literature, arts and commerce are the proper
realms of reason.” [8]
</blockquote>

In this discussion we see how vocation follows ethics.  Returning to my question at the
beginning, we <i>do</i> what we value.  What we love, and how we love, are the foundation
of the ethics of vocation. <P>

Luther’s doctrine of stations was expanded into a practical philosophy of vocation by
John Calvin.  As in the Protestant doctrine of salvation, the new thinking was based on
the New Testament writings of St. Paul, who advised the Christians in Corinth,
“Let each of you lead the life that the Lord has assigned, to which God called you.”
(1 Cor 7:17)  In his <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion,</i> Calvin wrote,

<blockquote>
 “… The Lord commands every one of us, in all the actions of life to regard his vocation …
He has appointed to all their particular duties in different spheres of life …. Every
individual’s line of life … is, as it were, a post assigned him by the Lord, that he may
not wander about in uncertainty all his days.” [9]
</blockquote>

This passage illustrates two essential features of Calvinism.  First, God has predetermined
everyone’s position in life; it is up to each individual to determine God’s calling.
This reflects the doctrine of predestination present in Calvinistic theology.  Second,
vocation is raised to the level of a command to industrious work for everyone, no
matter how high or low the position.  Indeed, because good works follow from Christ’s
redemption, Calvinists felt driven to perform good works to show themselves that they
were predestined to be saved! <P>

<H4>3. Puritanism and the Rise of Science</H4>

Imported into England, Calvinism became Puritanism, where it imbued what has come to
be known as the Puritan work ethic.  Transported from England to North America, the
Puritan way of life contributed to the rapid development of the New World.  It also
fostered the development of empirical science, and therefore to the Enlightenment era,
according to a widely-accepted thesis advocated by historian of science Robert Merton.
This leads our discussion from the ethics of vocation in general, to the ethics of a scientific
vocation, or a calling in science. <P>

In the book <i>Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England,</i>
derived from his doctoral dissertation, Robert Merton summarizes his thesis as follows:

<blockquote>
“Puritan sentiments and beliefs prompting rational, tireless industry were such as to aid
economic success.  The same considerations apply equally to the close connection
between Puritanism and science: the religious movement partially ‘adapted’ itself to the
growing prestige of science but it initially involved deep-seated sentiments which inspired
its followers to a profound and consistent interest in the pursuit of science.” [10]
</blockquote>

Prior to the Reformation, the manual labor implicit in empirical science and technology had
lesser standing than philosophical contemplation.  However, with the theology of Calvin
and the ethos of Puritanism, thinkers could now reach into the world and thereby serve
both aspects of Christian love: Glorification of God and service to mankind.  Merton
quotes the physicist and chemist Robert Boyle, one of the founders of the first important
scientific organization, the Royal Society:

<blockquote>
“… it will be no venture to suppose that at least in the Creating of the Sublunary World,
and the more conspicuous Stars, two of God’s principal ends were, the Manifestation
of His own Glory, and the Good of Men.” [11]
</blockquote>

Boyle goes on to articulate the view of natural theology, that science can provide a
fuller account of God: 

<blockquote>
“… the knowledge of the Works of God proportions our Admiration of them, they
participating and  disclosing so much of the inexhausted Perfections of their Author,
that the further we contemplate them, the more Footsteps and Impressions we discover
to the Perfections of their Creator; and our utmost Science can but give us a juster
veneration of his Omniscience.” [12]
</blockquote>

Love of God has become love of Creation, and the first commandment becomes a
directive to study Nature. <P>

The Calvinistic incentive to demonstrate one’s salvation through good works also
played a role in the Puritan advancement of science, as Merton notes:

<blockquote>
“Puritanism itself had imputed a threefold utility to science.  Natural philosophy was
instrumental first, in establishing practical proofs of the scientist’s state of grace; second,
in enlarging control of nature and third, in glorifying God.  Science was enlisted in the
service of individual, society, and deity.… [T]he ‘glorification of God’ thus came to
be, in Puritan hands, the “fructification of science.” [13]<BR>
The efforts of Sprat, Wilkins, Boyle or Ray to justify their interest in science do not
represent simply opportunistic obsequiousness, but rather an earnest attempt to justify
the ways of science to God.  The Reformation had transferred the burden of individual
salvation from the Church to the individual, and it is this ‘overwhelming and crushing
sense of the responsibility for his own soul’ which accounts in part for both the acute
longing for religious justification and the intense pursuit of one’s calling.  If science were
not demonstrably a ‘lawful’ and desirable calling, it dare not claim the attention of those
who felt themselves ‘ever in the Great Taskmaster’s eye.’  It is to this intensity of feeling
that such apologias were due.” [14]
</blockquote>

The Puritan conception became so powerful, of course, that science and its derivative,
technology, eventually displaced theology from her chair as Queen.  However, once a
religious justification was no longer necessary, science became for many a complete
worldview, naturalism.  Once fact became severed from value, the ethical basis for science
as a vocation was threatened.  Is there any longer a place for love in the ethos of science? <P>

<H4>4. Reflection on the Ethics of Science</H4>

In posing the metaphorical question of love, ethics, and science, I can only provide a
personal answer based on my own spiritual beliefs, which are rooted in Lutheranism.
I believe there are several ways in which science has an obligation to maintain its ethical
basis. <P>

First, it is a fallacy to say that scientists should deal only with facts and not values.
While I reject the extreme relativism of postmodern critiques, it is clear that societal
and ethical values affect the course of science, in physics and astrophysics as well as
in biology.  (Nuclear energy and space exploration are two obvious examples.)
As a Christian, I would go further to argue that scientists are obligated to consider
more than pure materialist values.  Luther wrote that each of us has several callings,
not just the calling to our work.  A scientist’s calling can be to God just as much as a
theologian’s is.  Scientists are often reticent to speak of their spiritual or religious beliefs,
thinking that they have no station to do so.  Theology makes no such claim. <P>

Second, scientists are in a unique position to advance the appreciation of nature and
thereby increase the value placed on it in the hearts and minds of our neighbors.
Boyle’s remarks quoted above remain, in my view, as valid as ever.  Science can
affect more than just the knowledge leg of the classical triad of truth, beauty, and
goodness.  Like art, it establishes connections between the virtues. <P>

Perhaps the integration of science and religion as individual callings can be elaborated
into a broader ethical integration of religion and science in dialogue. Immanuel Kant’s
tombstone is engraved with the words from his <i>Critique of Practical Reason,</i>
“Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener
and more steadily they are reflected on: the starry heavens above me and the moral law
within me.”  Although Kant rejected the classical arguments for the proof of God, he
advanced an ethical argument based on moral and natural law.  Natural law is written
in the heavens and in our hearts.  Following Kant, by using our hearts as well as our
minds, perhaps we can discern our callings to God and mankind.  <P>
