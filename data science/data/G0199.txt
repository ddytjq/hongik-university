<b> 4.1 Summary</b><p>

We took pictures of galaxies for this catalog in 2 (for 82 galaxies)
or 3 (for 31 galaxies) passbands. We can determine what portion of the
spectrum of the galaxy is recorded on the individual frames taking
into account the transmission characteristics of the atmosphere, how
the aluminized mirrors reflect light, the transmission function of the
filter in use, and the sensitivity of the CCD device to
electromagnetic radiation at various wavelengths. In this respect the
individual frames hold scientific value. On the other hand, converting
a set of frames taken using different filters to a color-composite
picture is not a "scientific" process. Since the human eye is not
sensitive to color at very low light levels, and observers are not
looking through eyepieces at large telescopes regularly when observing
extragalactic objects nowadays, and because the color sensitivity of
various CCD devices, photographic emulsions, and the human eye differ
significantly, it is very difficult to construct a color picture
"similar" to what a human observer would see by looking through a very
large telescope (collecting enough light to stimulate his or her color
vision). Furthermore: the Lowell data is available only in 2 bands;
the Palomar data is taken in <i>g</i> (green), <i>r</i> (red), and
<i>i</i> (infrared) bands; the Lowell data was not calibrated through
standard-star observations; and foreground stars were removed (a process
that leaves colored-residuals in images).  This said, we outline our
attempt to create a useful set of color images using our data in the
paragraphs below.

<p>
<a name="registration"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 4.2 Image registration</b><p>

It is very important to align the 3 (or 2) images that will constitute
one color image. We looked at the original images (those before the
step of foreground-star-removal), interactively identified a handful
of stars that were not saturated and had narrow
point-spread-functions, and fitted three parameters: the required
rotation and the required shifts in <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions
for the images to be aligned. In the case of the Palomar images we
kept the <i>g</i> image unchanged and modified the <i>r</i> and
<i>i</i> bands to match the <i>g</i> image. In the case of the Lowell
images we modified the <i>R</i> frame to match the <i>J</i>
picture. An overhelming majority of the fits yielded close to zero
rotation. Some of the required shifts were significant, and in one
case (NGC 3556) resulted in an image cropped to such a degree that
considerable portions of the galaxy are not visible in the
color-composite image. We used sync interpolation to rotate and to
shift images.

<p>
<a name="assign"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 4.3 Assigning red, green, and blue</b><p>

In case of the Palomar images, where three bands are available, we
assigned the bluest image (<i>g</i>) to blue, the medium-wavelength
image (<i>r</i>) to green, and the reddest image (<i>i</i>) to red. The
effective wavelengths of the <i>g</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>i</i> filters
are 493nm, 655nm, and 820nm, respectively.  The system transmission
functions are plotted in the <a
href="cat_ug_3.htm#observations">previous section</a> of this User
Guide.  These do not match closely the wavelengths we usually
associate with blue, green, and red (approximately 400nm, 510nm, and
650nm) and are also far from peak sensitivities of the three cones in
the human eye used in photopic (color) vision at low, intermediate, and
high wavelengths (which are 430nm, 530nm, and 560nm). Nevertheless, if
there are no abrupt jumps in spectra of galaxies, if spectra do not
turn over in the range of 400-800 nm, the above assignments will give
us useful color information. If a galaxy emits relatively more light
toward short wavelengths, this galaxy will be blue with our choice of
colors; similarly, if a spectrum is relatively stronger toward
longer (redder) wavelengths, this galaxy in our picture will be red,
or at least redder than the blue galaxy just mentioned.

<p>

Our task is a bit more difficult with the Lowell galaxies. Only two
images were taken, one in the band designated as <i>J</i> (or
sometimes as <i>B_J</i>, to avoid confusion with the infrared <i>J</i>
band of the Johnson system, since this filter is "blue") and the other
in the band called <i>R</i>.  The <i>J</i> filter has an effective
wavelength of 450nm, while <i>R</i> has an effective wavelength of
650nm. The system transmission functions are also plotted in the <a
href="cat_ug_3.htm#observations">previous section</a>.  We chose to
assign <i>J</i> as blue, the average of <i>J</i> and <i>R</i> as
green, and <i>R</i> as red. Since we had to generate the green images
using the two available pictures, these color-composite images will
show less color variations than those constructed from three
independent images.

<p>

Proper scaling of the individual images is necessary before the above
assignments. We calibrated almost all images in our catalog (recorded
how many counts would represent zero magnitude in a given image). The
Palomar data was calibrated using standard stars observed during
the night we spent on the mountain, but the first part of the night
was not photometric. At Lowell standard-star data was not
available. We constructed color-color relationships using
representative galaxy spectra (see Frei and Gunn: "<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=A95-64002&db_key=AST&high=33121f228521756">Generating
colors and k-corrections from existing catalog data</a>," in the
Astronomical Journal, vol. 108, p. 1476, 1994). Using these tables and
published <i>B</i> magnitudes and <i>B-V</i> colors for our galaxies,
we could estimate the <i>g</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>i</i> magnitudes of
the Palomar galaxies and the <i>J</i> and <i>R</i> magnitudes of the
Lowell galaxies. For the Lowell galaxies, this is the only calibration
information we had; for the Palomar galaxies, this information
complements the standard-star data.

<p>

One of the Palomar galaxies (NGC 4498) had no published <i>B-V</i>
color in the literature, so the standard-star data is the only way of
calibrating this galaxy. Moreover, we compared the two methods (our
color-color tables and the standard-star method) of calibration in the
above paper and showed 0.1-0.2 magnitude (systematic) differences
between the colors obtained. To avoid this much error in the case of
the Palomar galaxies we decided to use the standard-star data for
calibration for all but three galaxies (NGC 3031, NGC 3198, and NGC
3319).  These three galaxies were observed during the first half of
the night when conditions may not have been photometric and the
magnitudes obtained with the two methods may have differed
significantly. Accepting the magnitudes obtained from the
standard-star observations for the rest of the 28 Palomar galaxies
solves the problem of NGC 4498, where color-color tables are useless
in the absence of a published <i>B-V</i> value.

<p>

Nine of the Lowell galaxies had no published <i>B-V</i> colors, and
since there are no standard-star magnitudes, we had to estimate the
colors of these galaxies. All nine galaxies (NGC 3596, NGC 3675, NGC
3893, NGC 4030, NGC 4136, NGC 4487, NGC 4593, NGC 5334, and NGC 5669)
are spirals with numerical Hubble types in the range of 3-6. Since
previous studies showed that galaxy-spectra form a one-parameter
sequence as the function of the Hubble type, assigning the mean color
of the same Hubble type to the galaxies with unpublished data is a
possible solution.  We calculated the mean of <i>B-V</i> colors of our
spirals in the catalog for numerical Hubble types 3-6. For Type=3:
<i>B-V</i>=0.85, T=4: <i>B-V</i>=0.69, T=5: <i>B-V</i>=0.60 and for
T=6: <i>B-V</i>=0.56. These numbers confirm the smooth behavior of the
<i>B-V</i> vs. T relationship.

<p>
<a name="white"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 4.4 Setting the white point</b><p>

Since the effective wavelengths of our filters are different form the
conventional red, green, and blue wavelengths, and are even different
for the two sets of images (Palomar and Lowell), we decided to use the
convention many people adopt while constructing color images:
adjusting colors so that the Sun would appear white, or a shade of
grey, depending on the brightness. All we had to figure out were the
<i>g-r</i>, <i>r-i</i>, and <i>J-R</i> colors of the Sun, in order to
scale are R, G, and B frames. Since we did not find published data, we
had to calculate the would-be colors of the Sun ourselves. We followed
an algorithm similar to the one in the paper we mentioned
above. First, we obtained the filter transmission curves, combined
them with the optics and CCD system efficiencies, the absorption
properties of the atmosphere, and two reflections from aluminum.  We
obtained spectra of four spectrophotometric standard stars, multiplied
the system transmission curves with these spectra, and integrated the
light to obtain "instrumental magnitudes." These magnitudes differ
from the magnitudes published in the literature for the same standard
stars, since the zero-points of the photometric systems are usually
set arbitrarily (making one's favorite standard star white and zero
magnitude, to mention one method). Comparing our "instrumental
magnitudes" and those values from the literature, we obtained offsets
for each band.  These offsets, added to the instrumental magnitudes,
now provide real magnitudes.

<p>

We entered the solar spectrum from Allen: "Astrophysical Quantities"
(The Athlore Press, 3rd edition, reprinted in 1983, page 172). We
multiplied this spectrum with all the transmission curves of our
systems (<i>g</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>J</i>, and <i>R</i>) and also
with the standard Johnson <i>B</i> and <i>V</i> filters. After
integrating, we added the instrumental offsets and subtracted 
magnitudes to obtain the required colors. <i>g-r</i> turned out to be
0.09, <i>r-i</i> is 0.02, and <i>J-R</i> is 0.87 for the Sun. We
calculated <i>B-V</i> as well, to check our method, and recovered the
quantity (0.65) well known from the literature.  We scaled our frames
according to these colors. This way we tied the Palomar and Lowell
colors together, and unfortunately ensured to have a very pale looking
set of color images.

<p>
<a name="gamma"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 4.5 Cutoffs, gamma, saturation</b><p>

Galaxy images represent a wide dynamic range of intensities, and CCD
devices record this information much better than non-linear
photographic emulsions did in the past. The central regions of
galaxies can be extremely bright, with the outskirts of galaxies very
faint in comparison (only slightly brighter than the background sky),
however, linear CCD devices are still capable of recording useful
information all over the galaxy.  It is difficult to represent all
this information in one single image. We gamma-corrected our images
(using gamma=2.2) in order to show more detail in faint regions of
the galaxy and still not saturate the bright center significantly.
See the <a href="cat_ug_2.htm#gamma">section 2</a> for more
information on gamma correction.

<p>

We assigned a minimum and maximum threshold to each image. Counts below
the minimum were set to zero, and show as black pixels in the
image.  Counts above the maximum were set to the maximum value, and
show as much red, green, or blue (or the required combination of
these three), as possible. The lower cutoff is usually the
sky plus 0.7 times sigma (of the sky). This is enough to set almost
all pixels belonging to the background sky to zero (black), but the
faint portions of the galaxy are still visible. The upper cutoff is
set to half the maximum brightness in the galaxy, that is, the
sky plus 50 times sigma, whichever is lower. For all but the faintest
galaxies this meant that the cutoff is actually the sky plus 50 times
sigma, and in the case of some faint galaxies the cutoff was half the
maximum value.

<p>

We used gamma correction between the minimum and maximum thresholds,
and assigned 8 bits to all R, G, and B, forming a 24-bit color
image. We saved a "ppm" (portable pixmap) file and converted that file
to JPEG setting the quality index to 75 percent (the usual
value). This method results in a very good quality but still small,
easy-to-download file. On the CD-ROM version of the catalog we include
files with a higher quality setting (95 percent), which means much
bigger files, with a slight quality increase.

<p>

We increased color saturation somewhat to improve the appeal of
these pictures. Galaxies show up very uninteresting if colors are set
correctly. Galaxies usually appear unsaturated and most probably would
look similar to the human observer at low light levels to those
yellowish-green pictures presented in Wray: "The Color Atlas of
Galaxies" (Cambridge University Press, 1988). In order to show more
color we enhanced the blue/green and red/green ratios according to:

<p>

red = red * (red/green)**1.8,    
<p>
blue = blue * (blue/green)**1.8

<p>

where the power was set to 1.8 after some experimentation with
different values. This is a rather strong extrapolation toward the
red and the blue, but pictures are still reasonable (not
oversaturated) and show observable color variations at the same
time.

<p>

Some pixels around the center of galaxies usually saturate to white,
making the overall level of the image bright enough to see detail in
the faint regions. In seven cases (NGC 2403, NGC 2541, NGC 3031, NGC
3675, NGC 4242, NGC 4571, and NGC 5204) the sky was too bright and
noisy. To solve this problem we set the lower cutoff to a higher value
(sky plus 1.5-2.0 times sigma) and decreased gamma (to 1.9).

<p>
<a name="problems"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 4.6 Possible problems</b><p>

Inherent to the nature of the algorithms described above we introduce
some problems to our color images. The most apparent three are
cropping, noisy residuals where stars were subtracted, and some strong
blue or green dots - again an artifact of star subtraction.

<p>

If one of the images used for color-composition is not centered well
in the field of the telescope, especially if portions of the galaxy
are missing in one band, color-composition is not possible over the
whole galaxy.  Only three images had this type of a problem (NGC 3556,
NGC 4731, and NGC 5985), and these had to be cropped, so that only
those portions are visible in the color image where composition was
successful. The rest of the picture is set to black.  The latter two
cases are hardly noticeable, only NGC 3556 is affected strongly.

<p>

all the images (see Frei: "<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=J96-06231&db_key=AST&high=33121f228514291">Semi-Automatic
Removal of foreground stars from images of galaxies</a>," in the
Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, vol. 108,
p. 624, 1996).  In some cases the removed star was very bright and
even careful cosmetic reconstruction of the underlying portions of the
galaxy could not fully get rid of the remainders. NGC 5792 shows one
example. Only 2-3 such residuals are apparent in the whole catalog,
with some others that are hardly noticeable.

<p>

<table align=right vspace=5 width=200 height=220 cellspacing=0

The semi-automatic star removal program first cleaned the frame that
later became our blue image, and subsequently processed the green and
the red images. The software was looking for bright stars first on the
blue image, and used the list of stars found on the blue plate
to process the green and red pictures as well. However, if there was a
strong red star that did not show up in the blue image, but became
more apparent in the green, or the red frame, our software took out
the peak in the green or the red frame only. In certain instances a
small blue residual may have remained in the blue frame, which -
unmatched in the green and red bands, and after strong gamma
correction and strong saturation of colors - may show up as a
relatively bright very saturated blue dot in the color
picture. Although we took extra care to redo the star removal in
questionable cases, some of our images may have this type of a
degradation.  Unfortunately, the very first image in our catalog, NGC
2403, which is a flocculent spiral, is the most likely candidate.
