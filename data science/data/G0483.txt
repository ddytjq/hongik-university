established that the 
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/ExpandUni.html">Universe is 
expanding</a>. Edwin Hubble made a plot of recession velocity vs distance
for galaxies that he had observed he found a straight line relationship. 
The slope of this line, known as the Hubble Parameter, H
<img src="./images/greek/approx.gif"> 
20 (km/s)/million l.y.,  has units of 1/time.  It is easy to see that, if the 
Universe is expanding at the present time, then at some point in the past,
all matter was once together. Thus, 1/H, called the <i>Hubble Time</i> is an 
estimate of the <a href="http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/darkmat/bbage.html">Age of 
the Universe</a>, about 15 billion years.
<p>
If we rewind the motion picture representing the history of the Universe, 
we can understand a great deal about its early state, just after the Big 
Bang. In its early stages the Universe was simpler than it has ever been.
It was very hot and in a state of <i>Thermal Equilibrium</i>, that is 
its temperature determined all its other properties. Just after the Big Bang,
temperatures were so high that particle pairs could be created purely out of 
the heat energy present. For example, a pair of thermal photons - which would 
be gamma-rays at these temperatures - might react to form an electron/positron 
pair:

</center><p>
During its early phases the Universe was <i>radiation dominated</i>, that is 
the photons dominated the energy and pressure of the Universe.  As the 
Universe expanded, it cooled, T <img src="./images/doodads/propto.gif"> 1/R, 
where R is some measure of the "scale of the Universe".

The net result of the early nuclear reactions
<a href="http://spectrum.lbl.gov/education/elements/early/early_a.html">
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</a> is to transform all of the neutrons, along with 
the necessary protons, into Helium nuclei plus traces of <sup>2</sup>H
(deuterium), <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>6</sup>Li, <sup>7</sup>Be.
<p>
<center><img src="./images/bb_nuc.gif"><br>
<font color ="blue">Nuclear Reactions in the Big Bang</font></center>
<p>
<i>
Why is nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang different from nucleosynthesis in stars?
</i> <br>
The answer lies in the particles present in the early Universe and the 
temperatures and densities present when nuclear reactions are occurring:
<ul>
<li> In the early Universe protons react with neutrons to form deuterium as a 
first step:
<center>
	p<sup>+</sup> + n <sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> 
	<sup>2</sup>H + <sub><img src="./images/doodads/gamma.gif"></sub>
</center>

The <i>Proton-Proton Chain</i> has as its first step the reaction of two 
protons:
<center>
p<sup>+</sup> + p<sup>+</sup>  <sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> 
<sup>2</sup>H + e<sup>+</sup> <sub><img src="./images/doodads/nue.gif"></sub>
</center>
which is much more difficult to accomplish because of the repulsive 
charges positive charges.  But there are no free neutrons in the centers of 
stars; they all got used up in the Big Bang (besides free neutrons decay).
So stars are left with the P-P Chain (or CNO Cycle).
<li>Stars continue with the 3-<img src="./images/doodads/alpha.gif"> Process 
and, depending 
upon the mass, other nuclear burning stages, but the Big Bang stops with 
Helium and traces of other low mass elements.  This is because the Universe
is expanding and the density decreasing as nuclear reactions are occurring.
By the time Helium fusion has occurred in the Big Bang the density is too low 
for the 3-<img src="./images/doodads/alpha.gif">, which requires the 
<i>simultaneous</i> collision of three helium nuclei.
</ul>
<p>
<font size=+2 color="burgundy">
<u>Evidence for the Big Bang</u></font>
<p>
What a wonderful mythology!  Is there any evidence beyond the hyperactive 
imaginations of Cosmologists that this really happened?
<ul>
<li>The expansion of the Universe suggests that some sort of explosion or "Big 
Bang" took place, but any decent theoretical astrophysicist can find a way 
to wiggle out of the need for a Big Bang.  (One theory proposed a number of 
years ago was called the Steady State Theory; some astrophysicists are still 
trying to redeem a version of the Steady State.)
<p>
<li>We do find that in most places in the Universe where we can measure the 
amount of helium that it amounts to about 10% compared with hydrogen's 90%.
The helium production in the early Universe is not very sensitive to the 
details of the calculation
<p>
<li><table><td valign=top><b>The strongest evidence that 
something like the Big Bang really happened is the
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/Footprints.html">Cosmic 
Background Radiation</a> predicted by Cosmologist George Gamov in 1948 and 
discovered by Arno Penzias &amp; Robert Wilson of Bell Labs in 1965. All those
<sub><img src="./images/doodads/gamma.gif"></sub>-rays described above are 
part of the 
<i>thermal radiation</i> present in the early Universe because it is hot.  
As the Universe expanded and cooled, the radiation field cooled along with it. 
When matter and radiation "decoupled" with the formation of atoms a million 
years after the Big Bang, the radiation had cooled to visible light.  Although 
the matter distribution has become complicated with the formation of galaxies 
&amp; stars since that time the light has simply continued to cool with the 
expansion.  Gamow predicted that the Universe should be filled with this 
"relic radiation left over" from the 
Big Bang. (Gamow calculated a temperature of 15K; Dicke &amp; Peebles at 
Princeton recalculated the value in 1963, predicting a Temperature near 3K.) 
Using the peculiar horn-shaped antenna shown in the picture to the right,
Penzias &amp; Wilson made the first glimpses of the Cosmic Background Light
quite unexpectedly.  Since their discovery the evidence has become stronger 
and stronger that we are seeing the light from the Big Bang.  Penzias &amp; 
Wilson received the <a href="http://sentef2.fi.uib.no/~ladi/Nobel95.html">Nobel
Prize in Physics</a> in 1978.

<p>
<li>Recall that about 1s after the Big Bang, before electron-positron 
annihilation caused reheating, neutrinos decoupled from the rest of the matter 
and radiation in the Universe.  There should be a <i>Cosmic Neutrino 
Background</i> with a characteristic temperature of about 2K.  These neutrinos 
are far too low in energy to be detected by current techniques, but there 
should be about 300 neutrinos/cm<sup>3</sup> around (about a factor of three 
less than the number of Cosmic Background photons and a billion more than the 
number of baryons).  If neutrinos have mass, the large number 
of Cosmic Neutrinos may have implications for the dark matter in the Universe.

Radiation temperature reflect small density fluctuations in the early Universe 
before matter and light parted company.  After decoupling, the density 
fluctuations could grow under gravity to form the seeds for galaxies and 
clusters.  The nature of these fluctuations agrees with current theories of 
the formation of structure in the Universe.  Future space missions such as
the <a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Microwave 
Anisotropy Probe (MAP)</a> have the potential of making detailed measurements 
of the structure of the early Universe at the time of recombination.
