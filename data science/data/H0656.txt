O. Wilson has never been afraid of thinking big. Though he		started with the small--ants, that is--he has, at each stage of		his career, turned to bigger and bolder things. First <I>The Insect Societies</I>, his classic look at the evolutionary forces shaping the baroque		social lives of insects. Then <I>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</I>, his best-known book, setting out the biological principles that		Wilson thinks underlie all animal societies. Then <I>On Human Nature</I>, his immensely controversial look at the role of genes in <I>our</I> behavior and culture. And now, several books, two Pulitzer Prizes		and one National Medal of Science later, <I>Consilience</I>, his most ambitious work yet.</P>		<P>As might be expected given his stature, <I>Consilience</I> has gotten a great deal of attention. While <I>The New York Review of Books </I>is supposed to take note, when's the last time a book sporting		a subtitle like &quot;The Unity of Knowledge&quot; got a four-page spread		in <I>Newsweek</I>? <I>Consilience</I>, not surprisingly, finds itself perched on the <I>New York Times </I>best-seller list.</P>		<P>The point of Wilson's new book is simple enough. All knowledge--from		the humanities through the social sciences to the natural sciences--can		be unified. Wilson calls this &quot;consilience,&quot; literally a &quot;jumping		together&quot; of knowledge by linking facts and theories at one level		with those at another. The natural sciences already show such		linkage--biology blurs into chemistry which blurs into physics.		It is time, Wilson thinks, for the humanities and social sciences		to join the party. Time for economists to worry about the biology		of behavior and for biologists to worry about the origins of art.		Such fusion will, he thinks, both invigorate the humanities and		change the face of the social sciences, giving the latter a long		overdue taste of progress. As you can probably already tell, Wilson's		consilience features a directionality. Pleading &quot;guilty, guilty&quot;		to charges of crass scientism and reductionism, Wilson believes		consilience will involve the collapse of at least some of the		social sciences into biology. Even the humanities will &quot;draw closer		to the sciences and partly fuse with them.&quot; Philosophy, &quot;the contemplation		of the unknown,&quot; seems in a particularly bad way, as the consilience		machinery will be set to &quot;turning as much philosophy as possible		into science.&quot; </P>		<P>But the payoff from all this is potentially huge. Our fragmented		intellectual landscape will meld into a single beautiful body		of knowledge. More important, consilience might provide the sort		of big-picture wisdom that's needed to save both liberal education		and the planet. And, last, a consilient science might even bring		absolute objective truth within human reach (a possibility we'll		get back to).</P>		<P>As might be expected given the grand scale of his mission, Wilson's		book covers a lot of ground. <I>Consilience</I> begins with a retrospective on the unity of knowledge, paying		special tribute to the Enlightenment and logical positivism, those		two great bursts of unification optimism. But most of the book		is given over to a link-by-link look at the chain of consilience:		the sciences, the mind, culture, human nature, the social sciences,		the arts, ethics, and the environment each get a chapter. At each		stage, Wilson highlights connections linking higher levels to		lower: the brain springs from genes, consciousness springs from		brains, and culture springs from conscious minds. In a few cases		he sketches connections that reach across several levels, as when		he suggests that the ubiquity of serpents in Amazonian art (as		well as in the drug-induced hallucinations of Amerindian mystics)		reflects an inborn fear of snakes that is likely common to all		Old World primates. In the end Wilson's lesson is that present		disciplinary boundaries are not reflections of real breaks in		nature but mere &quot;artifacts of scholarship&quot;. The great intellectual		challenge facing us is therefore clear: building links between		artificially disjoined disciplines. The future will belong to		synthesists. </P>		<P>There is much that is right about <I>Consilience</I>. The most immediately striking is the writing. Wilson possesses		an elegant, spare style that could stand to be widely emulated		even (or perhaps especially) by those who'll disagree with his		every sentence. Many will also be surprised by his cool tone.		Though his claims might be revolutionary, his rhetoric is reserved.		(The one exception involves his deft demolition of postmodernist		nonsense. Wilson has, it turns out, immersed himself in the obscurantist		scribblings of Derrida and company. The experience, to put it		delicately, did little to change his prior impressions.) Wilson		also does a good job of digging up interesting but obscure bits		of science, such as prosopagnosia, in which specific brain lesions		leave victims unable to recognize faces, but not other objects.		And I, for one, enjoyed his reflections on what makes for a superior		scientist. Though he never draws these thoughts together in a		single discussion, what he does say --championing fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants		intellectual daring--is worth saying. All in all, <I>Consilience</I> is a gentle, enjoyable read.</P>		<P>But the book is not without flaws. Indeed I believe <I>Consilience</I> suffers from two classes of problems, one fairly general and		the other specific. The general problems--vagueness and philosophical		naivet&eacute;--are, in the end, probably the more important. Indeed		they are problems that plague Wilson's whole approach.</P>		<P>Wilson's frustrating vagueness mars even his discussion of points		that lie at the heart of his project. This begins with his vision		of consilience itself. Sometimes consilience means something hard:		a reduction of all knowledge to a few laws of physics. This is		consilience in the strict sense of &quot;unity of knowledge.&quot; But at		other times consilience means something soft: the notion, say,		that economists and ecologists should put their heads together		on the environmental crisis (an idea that Wilson discusses at		considerable length). This is consilience in the weak pragmatic		sense of &quot;your discipline needs to talk to mine.&quot; But it's obvious		that you can buy the latter kind of consilience (who wouldn't?)		without the former. Obvious that you can think it wise to incorporate		measures of environmental health into traditional economic indices		without thinking this involves the collapse of a social science		into a natural one. This sort of ambiguity tends to work in Wilson's		favor. Consilience is a hazy target seen in a seductive soft focus		and anyone airing doubts about its stronger claims tends to get		greeted by indignant defenses of its weaker aspects (&quot;Surely you		don't think economists can ignore the environment?&quot;). </P>		<P>Wilson is also surprisingly vague about the <I>methods</I> that lead to consilience. He typically holds his approach up		as an unapologetically reductionist one. But after fifty pages		of such talk, he suddenly announces that emergent phenomena--qualitatively		new beasts not predictable from the behavior of their parts--might		also walk the earth, &quot;especially at the living cell and above.&quot;		One would think this an issue someone espousing the unity of knowledge		at book length would have fairly clear ideas about. After all,		emergent phenomena--if real--change everything. But Wilson then		reveals that there's not only consilience by reduction but a holistic		&quot;consilience by synthesis&quot; which works the other way round. By		the end it gets hard to distinguish consilience from the idea		that intellectual connections are good. Not an objectionable philosophy,		but not a particularly precise one either.</P>		<P>Ambiguity also haunts Wilson's description of the <I>results</I> of consilience, especially the relationship between art and science.		In some places he says a consilient science will do things like		uncover the biological basis of creativity--a strictly scientific		enterprise that stays off the toes of artists. But in other places		he suggests that science will help tell us why painting A is better		than painting B--a traditionally artsy enterprise. (Wilson believes		neurobiology will find innate rules that cause us to prefer some		visual art to others. The fact that twentieth-century art has		been virtually defined by the rise of styles that people at first		hated doesn't seem to bother him.) Finally, he suggests that science		should determine not only if art is &quot;steered by inborn rules of		mental development&quot; but if those rules are adaptive. But some		of these roles for science are far more plausible than others.		If I believe biology will shed light on creativity (plausible)		but that it will make negligible contributions to art interpretation		(more plausible), am I a consilience fan? </P>		<P>The second general problem plaguing Wilson's book is one of philosophical		naivet&eacute;. We scientists are, of course, notorious for thinking		all philosophical problems straightforward. Scientists tend to		swagger into town, confident that a bit of straight shooting will		set all aright. Though typically modest, Wilson slips into this		cowboy role all too easily. A number of philosophical problems--		mind-body, free will, the failure of logical positivism-- pop		up in the course of his book. And Wilson guns them down at a staggering		rate. Unfortunately, his solutions are often surprisingly superficial.		In the end it's hard to escape the conclusion that Wilson often		just doesn't <I>see</I> the problem. He sees half of it, or less than half of it, and		sets diligently to whittling away at some corner of it. When he		announces his solution--often in a one-liner--he seems mildly		astonished that no one previously saw so simple an answer. </P>		<P>Let me give an example. As a champion of unity of knowledge, Wilson		is anxious to explain away the demise of that last great unification		craze, logical positivism. The positivists believed that by formalizing		scientific language and by following a few formulaic guidelines		(<I>e.g</I>., verificationism) scientists could &quot;close in on objective truth.&quot;		But logical positivism crashed and burned. And Wilson thinks he		knows why: &quot;Its failure, or put more generously, its shortcoming,		was caused by ignorance of how the brain works. That in my opinion		is the whole story.&quot; But the good news, Wilson assures us, is		that neurobiology and artificial intelligence are coming to our		rescue. Once they reveal how the brain works--once they show us		how to correct the distortions our nervous systems impose upon		reality--&quot;the grail of objective truth&quot; might be ours.</P>		<P>It's hard to know where to start with this sort of argument. For		one thing, the idea that absolute objective knowledge can be built		on a foundation of brain sciences faces an obvious problem: our		knowledge of the brain must itself remain uncertain, tainted by		the very subjective distortion and outright error that Wilson		is trying to get rid of. For another, there's more standing between		science and the &quot;ultimate goal of objective truth&quot; than ignorance		of the brain's blueprints. Almost all scientific truths take the		form of universal propositions reached by induction and are therefore		permanently subject to doubt. As Russell said somewhere, induction		for a chicken means the farmer comes to feed him each morning.		But one morning the farmer comes and wrings his neck. The point		is that most scientific truths are <I>logically</I> fated to remain un-absolute. And none of this goes away no matter		how well you understand the hypothalamus. Unfortunately this is		not an isolated incident. Much of Wilson's book consists of such		superficially attractive--but ultimately just superficial-philosophical		talk.</P>		<P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">Bang for the Buck</FONT></B><FONT FACE="AGaramond Regular" SIZE="1"> </FONT></P>		<P>On to the specifics. Three particular problems seem to beset Wilson's		vision of the unity of knowledge: He overestimates the return		likely to result from connecting human culture to biology; he		underestimates the difficulty of getting consilience, even where		it would pay; and he neglects good reasons (having to do with		the likely limits of our minds) for thinking consilience may not		only be hard, but impossible. Let's consider these in turn.</P>		<P>Wilson spends much of his time on a single consilient link, that		hooking up culture to biology. Wilson believes, of course, that		genes influence human behavior. But he bends over backwards to		emphasize that he's not a naive genetic determinist. Instead he		leans heavily on a notion borrowed from developmental genetics:		genes lay down &quot;epigenetic rules&quot;--inherited regularities of development		that affect how an organism looks or behaves. &#131;These innate predispositions		don't determine your appearance or behavior, which may depend		on the environment (including cultural) in which you find yourself.		(For example, a genetic predisposition to some type of cancer		doesn't mean you'll get it. Your diet, sun exposure, etc. also		matter.) An epigenetic rule is therefore an innate bias and one		that could be weak. </P>		<P>But the trick, according to Wilson, is that these genetic predispositions		tend to trickle up, &quot;bias[ing] cultural evolution in one direction		as opposed to another, and thus connect[ing] the genes to culture.&quot;		That is, genes mean there is a human nature, and this nature affects		the culture we make. <I>Ergo</I>, social scientists, or anyone else who wants to understand culture,		had better know some biology.</P>		<P>I've never found this claim--the weak, non-genetic, determinist		version--particularly troubling. In principle biology more or		less has to predispose us to act in some ways and not others.		The point is perhaps best made in reverse. Imagine an organism,		even a smart one, whose biological make-up <I>doesn't</I> affect its behavior or culture. It's hard to do. An organism		that's six feet tall is unlikely to build cathedrals that are		six inches tall. An organism with no eyes is unlikely to write		bad poetry about azure skies.</P>		<P>But it's equally clear that there will be a spread in the strength		of epigenetic rules. Some phenomena that might interest social		scientists will involve epigenetic rules and some of these may		be strict (take grammar, for example). Other phenomena might involve		epigenetic connections that, while real, are weak (maybe human		cooperation) and others involve none at all (building with arches		<I>versus</I> posts and beams). In the first case there's some bang for the		buck in talking about genes. In the last there is not. In the		intermediate case, which might be common, it's just not clear		if vague talk of weak epigenetic predispositions gets us anywhere.</P>		<P>And getting somewhere is what it's all about. Scientists are in		the business of finding powerful explanations. Getting such explanations		hinges on distinguishing first-order effects, which matter, from		second- and third-order ones, which don't. The question is not		whether there's some formal connection between A and B or whether		our explanation of B properly descends to a lower level, fulfilling		some consilient ideal. The question is: does it work? does our		theory explain the interesting and important facts that need explaining?</P>		<P>But as genetic connections to a phenomenon grow weaker, their		explanatory power falls. That's simply what we <I>mean</I> by a weak genetic connection. In the case of culture, this decreasing		power shows up in insights that get trivial fast. To see this,		try making predictions about art or literature that follow from		biology. (You don't need any special training to do this; sociobiological		predictions rarely spring from technical arcana about DNA-binding		motifs or mutation-selection balance.) I performed this exercise		before reading Wilson's book, with the following results: Artists		will depict a lot of naked ladies (assuming our artist is male);		most love poems won't be addressed to one's sister (incest avoidance		is possibly genetic); painters won't use pigments that radiate		solely in the ultraviolet and infrared (invisible to us). As it		turns out, the last is remarkably close to Wilson's favorite example		of consilience. One can, it turns out, roughly predict the order		in which color words enter language from knowing how the cones		in our retina encode light as color. Not surprisingly, black,		white, red and green are standard ingredients in most languages,		while chartreuse kicks in later. While worth knowing, this seems		a fairly thin consilient accomplishment. The fact that our eyes		convert continuous wavelengths into fairly discrete colors is		an interesting piece of biology, but the fact that this affects		how we describe the world seems a bit obvious. (We'd all agree		that if dogs could speak they'd lack color words.) If this is		the stuff of consilience, we can hardly expect art critics to		flock to biology summer school.</P>		<P>The point isn't that these insights from biology are wrong. The		point is they're not insights. The leash connecting culture to		biology (to use one of Wilson's favorite images) may well be real,		but it gets stretched so thin that it's often just not worth worrying		about. </P>		<P>By saying this, I'm not saying anything unscientific. Biologists,		after all, ignore lower-level processes all the time and no one		grumbles about that. To see this, consider one of the most famous		of evolutionary arguments, Fisher's theory of why most species		have equal numbers of males and females<SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP>. Now if you're a big consilience fan, you might insist on some		explanation that dips down below biology, hooking up with chemistry		or physics (e.g., the X chromosome has about the same mass as		the Y, thus X- and Y-bearing sperm move at equal velocities through		fluids giving each an equal chance of fertilization). The real		explanation looks nothing like this. Instead Fisher saw that when		one sex is rare the average individual of that sex produces more		kids than the average individual of the common sex. Thus any innate		tendency to make more of the rare sex enjoys an advantage and		gets more common. A 50:50 ratio is the only stable equilibrium.		This argument has nothing to do with the nuts and bolts of chemistry		or physics. Indeed its great beauty lies in the fact that it is		gloriously independent of such details. It's not that these details--sperm,		DNA, quarks--aren't there. Of course they are. It's just that		<I>they aren't where the expanatory action is</I>. To insist on a physico-chemical explanation would be to miss		the real story, one told by abstract characters like &quot;fitness&quot;		and &quot;innate tendency&quot; who are unknown at lower levels.</P>		<P>The important point in all this is that we have to distinguish		between what we might call ontological consilience (higher levels		are <I>made</I> of lower levels) and epistemic consilience (higher levels are		<I>explained</I> by lower levels).<SUP><A HREF="#3">3</A></SUP> Fisher's theory doesn't deny the fact that genes are made of		DNA. But it doesn't depend on knowledge of this fact--which is		why he could offer it 23 years before anyone heard of Watson and		Crick.</P>		<P>Wilson tends to mix up these two kinds of consilience. This leads		him to suggest, for instance, that because consumers are made		of neurons with evolutionary histories, economics must pay more		attention to biology. Now it might be a good thing if economists		knew more biology, but the notion that powerful economic explanations		will reside at the biological level does not follow from the fact		that consumers are made of gooey parts.</P>		<P>The same confusion (in reverse) leads Wilson sometimes to conflate		talk of what things are made of with explanation. Here, for example,		is his discussion of how biology might explain creativity in the		arts:</P>		<P>And if during this process [of charting the brain] the creative		mind is to be understood, it will need collaboration between scientists		and humanities scholars. The collaboration, now in its early stages,		is likely to conclude that innovation is a concrete biological		process founded upon an intricacy of nerve circuitry and neurotransmitter		release.</P>		<P>Well <I>of course</I> it will. What else could creativity (or, for that matter, counting		to ten) be made of but nerve circuitry and neurotransmitters?		As a claim about the physical building blocks of creativity, Wilson's		claim is right enough. But as an explanation of anything, it leaves		a bit to be desired. One may as well predict that sex ratios are		likely to be founded upon atoms.</P>		<P>This tendency to pass off claims about what things are made of		as consilience has the unfortunate side-effect of encouraging		a confusion about the legitimacy of higher-level phenomena. When		Wilson &quot;predicts,&quot; for example, that ethical phenomena will also		turn out to be neural, it's unclear what interesting conclusion		he thinks follows from this fact. Have we here &quot;reduced&quot; ethics		to biology? Anyone who's tempted to answer yes should consider		one further &quot;prediction&quot;: Mathematical thoughts will also involve		neurons. You're free, of course, to conclude that ethical truths		are just biology but only at the considerable risk of arriving		at the same conclusion about &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;.</P>		<P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">Consilience: Harder than You Think</FONT></B><FONT FACE="AGaramond Regular" SIZE="2"> </FONT></P>		<P>Wilson spends a good deal of time on several problems that appear		so deep and so stubborn that their solution will surely require		new consilience. The most obvious of these is the mind. As Wilson		explains, mental phenomena pose two essentially different challenges,		the so-called easy and hard problems of consciousness. The easy		problem is the stuff of classical brain research: How does the		brain respond to stimuli, store memories, etc.? The hard problem		is much harder: How does the brain give rise to subjective feeling?		How, that is, does a few pounds of wrinkled grey tissue sitting		atop our necks make it possible for us to <I>feel</I> anything? </P>		<P>Wilson understands that consciousness represents a (and likely		<I>the</I>) critical link in his consilience project. For the mind sits		at that crucial nexus linking art, literature, aesthetics, and		religion--that range of enterprises concerned with human feeling--with		biology, the domain of neurons and ion channels. Any attempt to		map the range of humanities onto the domain of science inevitably		runs through (and up against) the mind. Wilson appreciates this,		calling consciousness the &quot;master unsolved problem,&quot; labeling		the mind &quot;supremely important to the consilience program,&quot; and		admitting that science's failure to &quot;deliver in the domain most		crucial to its promise, the physical basis of mind&quot; spelled the		end of Enlightenment optimism. He also understands that a consilient		science cannot repeat this failure. Mental life cannot be left		to philosophers and poets.</P>		<P>But Wilson grossly underestimates the difficulty posed by the		hard problem of consciousness and so grossly overestimates how		easily consilience will come here. Indeed, in perhaps the most		remarkable passage of the book, Wilson announces that he more		or less <I>has</I> the solution: &quot;Although it is the nature of philosophers to imagine		impasses and expatiate upon them at book length with schoolmasterish		dedication, the hard problem [of consciousness] is conceptually		easy to solve.&quot; Here's his solution. First we must admit there's		something special about consciousness: Someone who knew all there		was to know about the neurobiology of color vision but who was		color blind could not know what the subjective experience of &quot;blue&quot;		is like. But this incapacity, Wilson thinks, is beside the point.		Instead, he curiously maintains that the critical distinction		lies eleswhere, in an understanding of the proper roles of science		and art. Science, Wilson tells us, answers the question of &quot;who		can feel blue and other sensations and who cannot feel them, and		explains why that difference exists&quot;, while art &quot;transmits feelings		among persons of the same capacity.&quot;</P>		<P>And here's where the trouble starts: for the hard problem of consciousness		is nowhere to be found in this divvying up of turf between science		and art. Science's role gets reduced to pointing out facts like		people feel blue and rocks don't, and to explaining the basis		of this difference (presumably, people have brains and rocks don't).		But surely this doesn't <I>exhaust</I> the role of science. Just because one can point to several legitimate		scientific questions about subjectivity doesn't mean that these		are the <I>only</I> legitimate questions. Here for instance is another: Just how		does subjective feeling arise from brains anyway? The hard problem		of consciousness, to belabor the obvious, is also a perfectly		legitimate scientific question. And it doesn't become any less		so by pointing to other, easier, questions.</P>		<P>Wilson in effect introduces a subtle new species of eliminativism		about consciousness. He doesn't flatly deny the phenomenon the		way Daniel Dennett does. Rather he divides up the intellectual		turf in such a way that no one gets left holding the problem.		If you buy his argument, the problem goes away not because it's		been solved but because no one feels obliged to talk about it.		This is a strange &quot;solution&quot; for anyone to propose, but an especially		bizarre one coming from someone who claims to be unifying, not		partitioning, the intellectual landscape.</P>		<P>But it gets worse. For this is followed by a discussion of the		&quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that scientific fact and art &quot;can never		be translated into each other.&quot; As if to show that the artist's		feeling and the scientist's fact can be brought together, Wilson		has us imagine a fancy future science that lets us read out the		mental contents of an experimental subject from a neurobiological		printout. The subject reads a sad novel and we--reading this mind		script--follow the narrative and also feel sad, and so on. Now		I don't doubt that such a thing is possible. In fact, I know it		is. For this is just a high-tech version of what ordinary language		does. When you speak to me, you reveal something about your mental		state and I--given the technology in my head--know how to decode		it. If you tell me a sad story, we both feel sad. If you tell		me a joke, we both laugh. We have transmission of feeling. The		only difference between this transmission and Wilson's is that		it takes some man-made (not biological) technology to do Wilson's		kind. But the force of this point is completely unclear.</P>		<P>More important, science's big role here in the transmission of		feeling gets us absolutely <I>nowhere</I> with the hard problem of consciousness. For the problem is not		to explain if or how we can transmit subjective feeling, but how		subjective feeling is possible in the first place. Deciphering		some super-EEG is impressive but ultimately beside the point.</P>		<P>Wilson wraps up this section with a detour into how this futuristic		mind script might resemble Chinese calligraphy (complete with		a quote from a Sinologist). But while this display of erudition		is impressive, it is quite irrelevant. Too many readers will likely		walk away wowed by Wilson's wide knowledge but oblivious to the		fact that he didn't make a dent in the allegedly &quot;easy&quot; problem		of consciousness.</P>		<P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">Mission Impossible?</FONT></B><FONT FACE="AGaramond Regular" SIZE="2"> </FONT></P>		<P>The recalcitrance of the hard problem of consciousness combined		with our inability to even imagine what its solution would look		like suggest a possibility that might well pull the rug out from		under Wilson's whole program: Maybe consciousness is beyond us.		Maybe we are simply incapable of figuring it out. Indeed maybe		there are hosts of problems that lie beyond our intellectual grasp.</P>		<P>Although the modern version of this idea was first articulated		by Noam Chomsky, it has grown closely associated with the philosopher		Colin McGinn.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP> Despite McGinn's occupation, his argument is essentially scientific,		indeed evolutionary. It is this. Cat brains did not evolve to		penetrate the deepest truths about nature but to get cats more		or less intact from one day to the next. My cat Boris's brain		is not, therefore, infinitely adroit. It knows a lot about birds,		mice, and how other cats behave, but is hopelessly lost when it		comes to chess, the purpose of fax machines, or the multiplication		table. Similarly <I>our</I> brains didn't evolve to penetrate the deepest truths about nature		but to get us from one day to the next. We have therefore no reason		whatever for believing that we, <I>Homo sapiens</I>, have arrived at some acme of cognitive evolution, that our chimpish		brains are the best that brains can be. Instead it seems far more		natural to suppose that we, like every other species, are intellectually		good at some things and hopelessly bad at others. In the lingo,		we are likely &quot;cognitively open&quot; to some phenomena and theories,		but &quot;cognitively closed&quot; to other phenomena (that are real) and		theories (that are true).</P>		<P>This so-called &quot;mysterian&quot; position<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A></SUP> can and probably does lead to a conclusion diametrically opposite		Wilson's. True consilience, the seamless integration of all we		know from ineffable aesthetic preference to hard-as-nails physics,		may be extremely unlikely. It's not just that we will suffer quantitative		limits on our cognitive powers (we can't memorize 942,921 digits).		Rather, we may get hung up at key steps in our reductionist program,		understanding a great deal about phenomenon A and a great deal		about phenomenon B, but fated to perpetual cluelessness about		the nature of their connection.<SUP><A HREF="#6">6</A></SUP> Those brains of ours that Wilson reminds us were shaped in Paleolithic		savannas did not evolve to crack, say, the master problem of consciousness.		And consciousness is only the most obvious such problematic juncture.		(Another might be that connecting free will, the stuff of human		law, to physiochemical determinism, the stuff of natural law.)</P>		<P>Though McGinn and Chomsky don't say so, a case might even be made		that some, though certainly not all, of the borders between traditional		intellectual disciplines represent the natural stress lines between		our domains of cognitive competence. <I>I.e.</I>, our inability to think clearly about some phenomena might underlie		our tendency to draw boundaries where we do: the humanities to		one side (telling me how you feel) and the sciences to the other		(telling me that your brain does the feeling). If true, routine		feats of reduction may be systematically easier within than between		disciplines.</P>		<P>As an evolutionary biologist, I find it hard to see how something		like the mysterian view cannot be true. The alternative--boundless		percipience--seems downright unbiological. (And I'm certainly		not the only biologist to reach this conclusion.<SUP><A HREF="#7">7</A></SUP>) But the news is not all bad. For while science may be consigned		to permanent impotence over say, subjective feeling, it would		get handed a new and likely tractable problem: feeling out the		edges of our domains of cognitive capacity, a task first suggested		by Chomsky.</P>		<P>It is unfortunate that Wilson, though clearly aware of these mysterian		worries, does not discuss them at any length.<SUP><A HREF="#8">8</A></SUP> It would have been interesting to hear why he finds his consilient		scenario more plausible than one that takes our likely limitations		seriously. Or why he thinks such limits, while real, will have		surmountable effects on his program. I suspect, but obviously		don't know, that Wilson would argue that science has (thankfully)		always turned a deaf ear to such defeatist worries and that it		would be both foolish and irresponsible for scientists to give		up the good fight. And I agree. But the issue is not whether scientists		should or should not try to conquer consciousness, art, or free		will, but whether we have any grounds for expecting success--any		grounds, that is, for taking Wilson's quixotic vision of the unity		of knowledge seriously.</P>		<P>Be that as it may, I suspect the real reason Wilson favors his		consilient scenario isn't because he finds it more plausible but		because he finds it more attractive. For as he admits near the		start of his book, consilience isn't science, it is a philosophy,		a metaphysical view that he obviously finds both beautiful and		deeply satisfying. The irony, of course, is that Wilson's own		science of evolution gives every reason for questioning this metaphysic,		every reason, that is, for doubting whether our brains--jury-rigged		and riddled with blindspots--are the stuff from which certain		knowledge and seamless consilience can be obtained. </P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>		<HR NOSHADE SIZE="1" "2">		<SUP><A NAME="1"></A>1</SUP> Capote, <I>The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places</I> (New York: Random House, 1973). </P>		<P><SUP><A NAME="2"></A>2</SUP> R.
