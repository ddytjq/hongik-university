15

Associations of Motor Clubs</a> within the <a href="http://www.msauk.org/" OnMouseOver="window.status='The RACMSA';return true">MSA</a>.
The country is divided into six large regions and allocated to one of those.
The Regional Associations that fall within each of these larger regions
then fight it out amongst themselves to host the rally. Having decided
which Association will promote the rally, a club or two is then chosen
to actually run the event.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Traditionally the event has a strong `navigational'
flavour rather than a standard road rally flavour. The event was originally
the idea of Brian Ottridge (RAFMSA) as a means of pitting road rally crews
from all over the UK against each other since the loss of <i>Motoring News</i>
events make this no longer possible. There is no British Road Rally Championship
currently although the current trends in modern road rallying may make
this a growing possibility if only the MSA was sufficiently open-minded
to consider it with a view to wanting to make it happen.</font>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Having just returned from the IA I'm surprised
nobody has posted anything about it - so here is my 2 penny-worth!</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">If any of the organising team subscribe to
this, please accept a huge thank you for organising a fantastic event and
for being so welcoming.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">For those of you that missed it, the event
was about 150 miles of the most incredible roads I have ever rallied on
- I called enough 90's to last me until the year 2000! The action was non-stop
with 'usual' code boards replaced by intermediate regularity controls,
where lots of time was lost by all. The navigation was pitched about right
for the roads with a few variations from the normal stuff but all explained.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The results were handed out on computer produced
sheets during the event at various controls and the provisional results
posted before most had finished breakfast - other organisers please note
it is possible to do it!</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Congratulations to the winning teams - ANICC
'B' team beating off the ANICC 'A' team into second place. The LCAMC team
finished third and first mainland team. Congratulations also to Mike and
Cath - they so nearly won but a second place is still very impressive over
there - believe me! Unfortunately, we didn't manage to negotiate one of
the 90's but thanks to one of the Scottish team members who stopped and
pulled us out of the hedge we managed to go on and finish the event.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The trip home was even more entertaining,
with all ferries to Holyhead cancelled because of the weather forcing us
into an overnight stay in Dublin before the long trip home on Sunday.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'm sure all that made the journey will think
it worthwhile and for those that didn't - you missed something!</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thanks again to Drew and his team</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mark Mark Goodman</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Behalf of Frazer Graham and my self (car
4) and the other members of the ANECCC team I can only echo Mark's views.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The organisers had simplified the navigation
presentations ( comapared to the '92 event) and the hours halt allowed
us to see results and swap stories!. Howeverthe roads were still brilliant!!
( i belive we used 3 stges from next yearsUlster Raly) and the Ordnance
survey of NI seem to have a sense of humour by missing out the odd bend
or three.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thanks to Drew and his team for another first
class event. Roll on the next one.</font></dt>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Judging by the description, the 1990 IARR
will have been Hawick &amp; Border CC's Teviotdale Rally. The infamous
overlap was caused by two editions of sheets 73 and 74, where they used
different alignments of the national grid. The white in question is the
old road running parallel to the A68 just south of the river Lauder; on
one alignment of the grid, a certain vertical line crosses the current
A68, and on the other it cuts the white. Standard local knowledge in the
Borders. Been there, dropped it ... :( This is no more with the advent
of the new 73 B and 74 B1 editions.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here are some more comments by Nigel Mollett:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second one was run the following year
in Scotland. Start in Hawick. Can't remember much coz we missed a TC on
a white which was on a overlapped portion of the map - it appeared on one
map but not on the other. The organisers had said at the start that one
map took priority over the other in cases of overlaps. A bit sneaky in
my opinion! I think the LCAMC won again.</font>

Brian Otridge. Started in Peterborough. 13 association teams ran (with
1,2 or 3 crews). LCAMC came 1st association. ACSMC came a close second
by only 9 minutes. ACSMC provided each of their 3 crews with 50 quid towards
expenses! ACSMC crews included Me and Bernie Marsden, and Terry Schraider
and Chas Davies. I can't remember who the other crew was but I don't think
it was a WCC pairing. The winners were from Scotland (and they complained
that the navigation was too easy!).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Comment of the rally before the event came
from Terry Schraider - "Usually there are half a dozen possible winners
on an event. This time, almost anyone could win it!"</font>
