 <CITE>Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder
 characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). The disease may develop due to
 reactivation of the measles virus or an inappropriate immune response to the measles virus.
 SSPE usually develops 2 to 10 years after the original viral attack. Initial symptoms may
 include memory loss, irritability, seizures, involuntary muscle movements, and/or behavioral
 changes, leading to neurological deterioration.

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To better understand B-cell activation in MS by analyzing
the immunoglobulin (Ig)G heavy chain variable region (VH) repertoire found in
MS brains and comparing it with brain VH sequences in individuals with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)--a chronic encephalitis produced by measles
virus (MV)-and characterized by an antigen-driven oligoclonal IgG response to
MV antigens. BACKGROUND: The specificity of oligoclonal IgG in MS CSF and
plaques, and their relevance to the pathogenesis of MS is unknown. METHODS:
Nested PCR was used to amplify and sequence the rearranged IgG heavy-chain VH
repertoire in plaques of three acute MS brains and in three SSPE brains. A
representative population of VH sequences from each tissue was aligned to the
known 51 functional VH germline segments. From this the authors determined the
closest VH family germline segment, and the degree and location of somatic
mutations for each unique IgG. RESULTS: As expected for an antigen-driven
response against MV antigens, most VH sequences from the SSPE brains were
mutated extensively compared with their closest germline segments. Furthermore,
SSPE VH sequences accumulated replacement mutations preferentially in the
complementary-determining regions (CDRs) relative to framework regions-features
normally observed during antigen-driven selection. A comparison of VH family
and germline usage also demonstrated that each SSPE brain had its own unique
IgG response. When the authors compared the VH response in MS plaques with
SSPE, MS VH sequences were also mutated extensively, displayed a preferential
accumulation of replacement mutations in CDRs, and were unique in each MS
brain. CONCLUSION: The presence of an antigen-driven response in MS, rather
than a nonconventional mechanism of B-cell activation, warrants additional
analysis of the specificity of IgG in MS brain and CSF.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) binding sites of the CD46 gene were sequenced in
patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and in controls. There
were 3 novel polymorphisms, including C/T at nucleotide position 38 (C/T38),
G/A at position 176 (G/A176), and C/T at position 453 (C/T453), at allele
frequencies of.97:.03, .99:.01, and.97:.03, respectively. The G/A176
polymorphism causes an Arg/Gln amino acid change within the essential binding
sites of MV, whereas the C/A38 polymorphism causes a Ser/Phe change outside the
MV binding sites. The C/T453 polymorphism does not produce an amino acid
change. Two of the 40 SSPE patients and 2 of the 32 controls had both C/T38 and
C/T453 polymorphisms in heterozygous patterns. One control subject, but no SSPE
patients, had the G/A176 polymorphism in a heterozygous pattern. Thus, it is
not likely that CD46 gene alteration has a role as a host susceptibility factor
in the development of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  It has been reported that measles virus may be present in the
intestine of patients with Crohn's disease. Additionally, a new syndrome has
been reported in children with autism who exhibited developmental regression
and gastrointestinal symptoms (autistic enterocolitis), in some cases soon
after MMR vaccine. It is not known whether the virus, if confirmed to be
present in these patients, derives from either wild strains or vaccine strains.
In order to characterize the strains that may be present, we have carried out
the detection of measles genomic RNA in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) in
eight patients with Crohn's disease, three patients with ulcerative colitis,
and nine children with autistic enterocolitis. As controls, we examined healthy
children and patients with SSPE, SLE, HIV-1 (a total of eight cases). RNA was
purified from PBMC by Ficoll-paque, followed by reverse transcription using
AMV; cDNAs were subjected to nested PCR for detection of specific regions of
the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) gene regions. Positive samples were
sequenced directly, in nucleotides 8393-8676 (H region) or 5325-5465 (from
noncoding F to coding F region). One of eight patients with Crohn disease, one
of three patients with ulcerative colitis, and three of nine children with
autism, were positive. Controls were all negative. The sequences obtained from
the patients with Crohn's disease shared the characteristics with wild-strain
virus. The sequences obtained from the patients with ulcerative colitis and
children with autism were consistent with being vaccine strains. The results
were concordant with the exposure history of the patients. Persistence of
measles virus was confirmed in PBMC in some patients with chronic intestinal
inflammation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Slow course case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is reported.
The onset was at the age of 16 years and death followed after 5 years. He was
observed during nine successive hospitalizations and the authors describe the
changing clinical symptomatology parallelly with successive EEG records and
brain MR imaging evolution. Successive phases of the disease were associated
with hyperintense changes in T2-weighted.images, and were situated initially in
occipital lobes, and involved later on periventricular areas and finally the
whole white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. Subcortical brain atrophy
developed parallelly.<p>

ABSTRACT:  INTRODUCTION: The interferons (IFN) have had considerable effect on
the course of relapses and the natural course of the disability of patients
with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effects of IFN in other neurological
disorders are little known. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature on the
experimental and clinical applications of the IFN in disorders of the nervous
system excluding MS. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed studies of the applications of
the IFN in viral diseases (experimental and human rabies, herpes zoster, herpes
virus, non-herpetic meningoencephalitic viruses, HTLV-I myelopathy, arbovirus
in animals, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy); supposedly viral diseases (Reye's syndrome), continuous
partial epilepsy (Kojewnikoff's syndrome); prion diseases (Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease); degenerative-hereditary diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Sturge-Weber-Dimitri syndrome);
immuno-allergic disorders (experimental myasthenia gravis, chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy-CIDP-); Landry-Guillain-Barre-Strohl syndrome,
polyneuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammapathy; tumour disorders
(benign and malignant primary tumours of the brain, metastatic tumours,
meningeal carcinomatosis, extra-intracranial haemangiomas, meningiomas), and
other causes (cuban epidemic neuropathy, neuro-Beccet). CONCLUSIONS: Disorders
of the nervous system in which IFN may be used in a clinical trial include:
herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections, HTLV-I myelopathy; subacute
sclerosing leukoencephalopathy, continuous partial epilepsy (Kojewnicoff's
syndrome), intra-extracranial haemangiomas, CIDP, polyneuropathy associated
with IgM gamma monoclonal disorder, malignant primary tumours, recurrent
meningiomas, some cerebral metastases, Behcet's disease and schizophrenia.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which
is associated with persistent measles virus (MV) infection in the brain, little
infectious virus can be recovered despite the presence of viral RNA and
protein. Based on studies of brain tissue from SSPE patients and our work with
MV-infected NSE-CD46(+) mice, which express the measles receptor CD46 on
neurons, several lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of viral spread
in the central nervous system differs from that in nonneuronal cells. To
examine this alternate mechanism of viral spread, as well as the basis for the
loss of normal transmission mechanisms, infection and spread of MV Edmonston
was evaluated in primary CD46(+) neurons from transgenic mice and
differentiated human NT2 neurons. As expected, unlike that between fibroblasts,
viral spread between neurons occurred in the absence of syncytium formation and
with minimal extracellular virus. Electron microscopy analysis showed that
viral budding did not occur from the neuronal surface, although nucleocapsids
were present in the cytoplasm and aligned at the cell membrane. We observed
many examples of nucleocapsids present in the neuronal processes and aligned at
presynaptic neuronal membranes. Cocultures of CD46(+) and CD46(-) neurons
showed that cell contact but not CD46 expression is required for MV spread
between neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that the neuronal
environment prevents the normal mechanisms of MV spread between neurons at the
level of viral assembly but allows an alternate, CD46-independent mechanism of
viral transmission, possibly through the synapse.<p>

ABSTRACT:  This article reports a typical case of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE). The patient contracted measles as an infant during the
1989 to 1991 United States measles epidemic. At 4 1/2 years of age, he
developed behavioral changes and quickly progressed through the typical
clinical stages of SSPE. His EEG was characteristic. Serum and CSF measles
immunoglobulin G were markedly elevated. He remains alive but is vegetative. To
our knowledge, this is the first case of SSPE stemming from the 1989 to 1991
measles epidemic. Because infants--the group at highest risk to develop
SSPE--were most severely affected by this measles outbreak, other cases of SSPE
stemming from this epidemic may occur.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In central nervous system (CNS) infectious and inflammatory diseases
of known cause, oligoclonal bands represent antibody directed against the
causative agent. To determine whether disease-relevant antibodies can be cloned
from diseased brain, we prepared an antibody phage display library from the
brain of a human with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a chronic
encephalitis caused by measles virus, and selected the library against SSPE
brain sections. Antibodies that were retrieved reacted strongly with measles
virus cell extracts by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and were specific for
the measles virus nucleocapsid protein. These antibodies immunostained cells in
different SSPE brains but not in control brain. Our data provide the first
demonstration that diseased brain can be used to select in situ for antibodies
directed against the causative agent of disease and point to the potential
usefulness of this approach in identifying relevant antibodies in chronic CNS
or systemic inflammatory diseases of unknown cause.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A follow-up study was carried out of 16 SSPE patients two years
after completion of 6-month treatment with Antineoplaston. The study was based
on an inquiry sent to the families of the patients and on control examinations
at the clinic. In the period of follow-up 6 patients died, all had the downhill
type of disease course and their mean survival was 18 months. Out of the
remaining 10 patients 4 are in stationary condition and the remaining ones had
minimal worsening. A more detailed clinical analysis showed that half the
patients were in contact with and general orientation in the environment, but
impairment of motor functions made difficult in most cases self-care and
self-dependent functioning. All patients had evident changes in brain MRI. The
survival time of the patients has been as yet from 2.5 to 5.5 years (mean 3.9
years). The results of the treatment with Antineoplaston AS2-1 + isoprinosine
are comparable with those observed during isoprinosine alone treatment but
significantly worse than those after administration of Propionibacterium
granulosum with isoprinosine. This suggests that Antineoplaston AS2-1 fails to
modify importantly the natural course of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 14-year-old boy presented with history of deterioration of
scholastic performance, altered behaviour, difficulty in walking and repeated
falls since last 2-3 months. He had history of delayed milestones and at 11
months developed febrile rashes. On investigations, MRI showed compensated
hydrocephalus with aqueductal stenosis. EEG suggested subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE). CSF was positive for measles antibody titre. This case
of aqueductal stenosis with SSPE is very interesting for its diagnostic
dilemma.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is associated with
inflammatory infiltration, neuronal loss, and demyelination. The pathogenesis
of these changes is unclear. We examined DNA fragmentation and Bcl-2 expression
in brain biopsies of nineteen SSPE patients to investigate the role of
apoptosis in tissue damage. DNA fragmentation was present in oligodendroglia,
and, in tissues with neuronal loss, in neurons. Reactive astrocytes had no DNA
fragmentation, but strong Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest apoptosis as
one of the mechanisms for oligodendroglial and neuronal death in SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Following the introduction of vaccinations against measles in 1975
supplemented in recent years with booster vaccinations at the age of 6 years
the epidemiological situation with respect to measles and SSPE has been
gradually improving, particularly recently. In the paper discussion is
presented on the question in what degree the present epidemiological situation
of measles, the epidemiological supervision and vaccinations against measles in
Poland meet the operative aim of measles and, consequently, SSPE elimination,
as recommended by the WHO Regional Bureau. Attention is called to incomplete
reliability of measles diagnosis based on clinical manifestations, economic
difficulties in conducting serological investigations (detection of IgM
antibodies to measles) necessary for measles confirmation, and shortcomings in
vaccination organization.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report a boy with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who
exhibited parkinsonian symptoms four months after onset. The symptoms improved
after administration of levodopa. One year after onset, bilateral symmetric
lesions appeared in the substantia nigra and the putamen, as observed using
magnetic resonance imaging. After a one-year interval, the lesions migrated to
the bilateral caudate and the cerebellar dentate nuclei. The series of
migratory legions, each of which was connected by axonal pathways originating
from the substantia nigra, suggests axonal spread of the SSPE virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The yfhP, yfhQ (mutY homologue), yfhS and yfhR (oxidoreductase
homologue) genes, which are located upstream of the sspE locus, have been
identified in the Bacillus subtilis genome. Transcriptional analysis showed
that yfhP, yfhQ and yfhR are transcribed during the exponential growth phase,
and sspE is monocistronically transcribed in the late sporulation phase and
co-transcribed with yfhQ and/or yfhR during exponential growth. However, SspE
was not translated during this period. Northern blot and primer extension
analyses indicated that yfhS is transcribed by E sigma E during sporulation. No
significant difference between wild-type and yfhS mutant strains was found in
the rate of sporulation or germination, the heat tolerance of spores or the
transcription of the sspE locus during sporulation. The transcription of the
yfhP and yfhQ-yfhR-sspE loci increased 2.5- and 5.3-fold in a yfhP-deficient
strain compared to the wild-type strain at t-2 (2 h before initiation of
sporulation). In addition, transcription corresponding to the yfhR-sspE loci
increased more than twofold with maximum values observed at t-1.5. These
results suggest that YfhP may act as a negative regulator for the transcription
of yfhQ, yfhR, sspE and yfhP.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report eight patients with adult-onset subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE), of which, four were treated with oral isoprinosine and
four with intraventricular alpha-interferon plus oral isoprinosine. One of the
four patients treated with oral isoprinosine died within two months, and the
disease progressed in three patients. Of the four patients treated with oral
isoprinosine plus intraventricular alpha-interferon, one showed mild
progression, one remission, and the remaining two showed stabilization. The
group of patients is relatively small, but our results suggest that treatment
with oral isoprinosine plus alpha-interferon is effective for SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Two archival cases diagnosed 20 years ago on routine
neuropathological methods as Encephalitis Necroticans Acuta (ENA) were
investigated in EM and by immunohistochemical methods. The previous diagnosis
was confirmed only in one case because Herpes simplex virus was found. In the
second case the intracellular inclusions visible in ME corresponded to Measles
Virus thus previous diagnosis was changed to SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is an inflammatory
neurodegenerative disease related to the persistence of measles virus. Although
its frequency is declining because of measles eradication, we still have some
cases being diagnosed. With the aim to describe epidemiological aspects of SSPE
in Brazil, we sent a protocol to Child Neurologists around the country, 48
patients were registered, 27 (56%) were from the southeast region, 34 (71%)
were male and 35 (73%) white, 27 (56%) had measles, 9 (19%) had measles and
were also immunized, 7 (14%) received only immunization, 1 patient had a
probable neonatal form. Mean time between first symptoms and diagnosis was 12
months (22 started with myoclonus or tonic-clonic seizures, 7 (14%) with
behavioral disturbances); 36 patients (75%) had EEG with pseudoperiodic
complexes. Follow up performed in 28 (58%) patients showed: 12 died, 2 had
complete remission and the others had variable neurological disability. Our
data shows endemic regions in the country, a high incidence of
post-immunization SSPE and a delay between first symptom and diagnosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The presence of increased IgG in the brains of humans with
infectious and inflammatory CNS diseases of unknown etiology such as multiple
sclerosis may be a clue to the cause of disease. For example, the intrathecally
synthesized oligoclonal bands (OGBs) in diseases such as subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) or cryptococcal meningitis have been shown to represent
Ab directed against the causative agents, measles virus (MV) or Cryptococcus
neoformans, respectively. Using SSPE as a model system, we have developed a
PCR-based strategy to analyze the repertoire of IgG V region sequences
expressed in SSPE brain. We observed abnormal expression of germline V
segments, overrepresentation of particular sequences that correspond to the
oligoclonal bands, and substantial somatic mutation of most clones from the
germline, which, taken together, constitute features of Ag-driven selection in
the IgG response. Using the most abundant or most highly mutated gamma H chain
and kappa or lambda L chain sequences in various combinations, we constructed
functional Abs in IgG mammalian expression vectors. Three Abs specifically
stained MV-infected cells. One Ab also stained cells transfected with the MV
nucleoprotein, and a second Ab stained cells transfected with the MV-fusion
protein. This technique demonstrates that functional Abs produced from putative
disease-relevant IgG sequences can be used to recognize their corresponding
Ags.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare progressive
neurologic disorder. A 9-year-old boy was seen who had progressive
neurocognitive decline, myoclonic jerking of the extremities, and an abnormal
result of an electroencephalogram (EEG). Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed
multifocal subretinal lesions. The diagnosis of SSPE was made on the basis of
the clinical examination and elevated serum and spinal fluid measles titer. We
describe subretinal lesions in a patient with SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An efficient and novel method for the identification of toxic
compounds in industrial wastewater was developed. In the first step, the
samples collected were tested for toxicity using the recently developed
ToxAlert 10 system based upon luminescence inhibition of freeze-dried Vibrio
fischeri. In the second step, sequential solid-phase extraction (SSPE) and
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for compound identification
were employed to isolate and identify compounds in the waters. Average
recoveries ranging from 72 to 95% were obtained using the SSPE methodology for
ubiquitous analytes such as poly(ethylene glycol)s, nonylphenol and alcohol
polyethoxylates, phenols, linear alkylbenzenesulfonates, and benzene- and
naphthalenesulfonates. In the third step, all the extracts obtained after SSPE
followed by LC/MS identification were tested again with the ToxAlert system.
The procedure was applied to influent and effluent samples of a sewage
treatment plant (STP) and to a raw tannery effluent that constitutes the main
type of influent in the receiving waters of the STP. This method has shown
that, despite the complexity of the untreated tannery wastewaters with an
average total organic carbon (TOC) value of 1960 mg of C/L, the biological
treatment of the STP eliminates compounds that inhibit luminiscence of V.
fischeri. In the final step, the chemical toxicity of the tentatively
identified chemicals was tested to identify the toxicants in the waters.
Comparison of the toxicities of the sample, the extracts, and individual
components has shown that diverse classes of pollutants were responsible for
toxicity, as all fractions of toxic samples gave significant bioluminescence
inhibition values. Toxicity of the two intermediate-polarity SSPE fractions was
attributed to alcohol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylates,
bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, and linear alkylbenzenesulfonates. In the most
nonpolar and most polar fractions, identification of the compounds responsible
for toxicity was unclear. By the toxicity-based fractionation, followed by
LC/MS methodology, it was feasible to identify between 1.4 and 7.5% of the TOC,
thus expanding the number of toxicants identified in these complex wastewaters
as compared to those identified by conventional gas chromatography/mass
spectrometric (GC/MS) methods. When artificial water samples were reconstituted
using similar concentrations of the chemicals detected in the wastewaters,
nonsynergetic toxicity effects were observed for all analytes with the
exception of 2,6-naphthalenedisulfonate (2,6-NPS), which promoted the
bioluminescence inhibition. The toxicity-directed identification was successful
for the STP's samples and showed 1400 times higher toxicity for the raw tannery
wastewaters as compared to the mixed industrial and domestic wastewaters by
applying the Weibull model.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) infections normally cause an acute self limiting
disease which is resumed by a virus-specific immune response and leads to the
establishment of a lifelong immunity. Complications associated with acute
measles can, on rare occasions, involve the central nervous system (CNS). These
are postinfectious measles encephalitis which develops soon after infection,
and, months to years after the acute disease, measles inclusion body
encephalitis (MIBE) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) which are
based on a persistent MV infection of brain cells. Before the advent of HIV,
SSPE was the best studied slow viral infection of the CNS, and particular
restrictions of MV gene expression as well as MV interactions with neural cells
have revealed important insights into the pathogenesis of persistent viral CNS
infections. MV CNS complication do, however, not large contribute to the high
rate of mortality seen in association with acute measles worldwide. The latter
is due to a virus-induced suppression of immune functions which favors the
establishment of opportunistic infections. Mechanisms underlying MV-mediated
immunosuppression are not well understood. Recent studies have indicated that
MV-induced disruption of immune functions may be multifactorial including the
interference with cytokine synthesis, the induction of soluble inhibitory
factors or apoptosis and negative signalling to T cells by the viral
glycoproteins expressed on the surface of infected cells, particularly
dendritic cells.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Sequence analysis of 285 nucleotides located on the variable part of
the N gene was undertaken on measles virus (MV) samples collected from acutely
infected patients in Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, and Russia.
Two distinct genotypes (C2 and D6) have circulated in Germany between 1993 and
1996. Isolates of genotype C2 were related to strains reported in Germany
before 1993. This genotype was also found in the Czech Republic in 1992 and in
Denmark in 1997. The occurrence of genotype D6 in Germany is described below
for the first time. In 1998, this genotype was identified in Poland. Genotypes
C2 and D6 were also reported in Spain and in the United Kingdom between 1992
and 1996. Therefore, it is concluded that these genotypes are widely
distributed over Europe. The analysis of the isolates from Russia revealed that
genotype A was present in 1988 in the European part of the country and in 1996
in Siberia. An isolate identified in 1997 in Siberia belonged to genotype D6,
which had never been found previously in Russia. We also analysed MV obtained
from a case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in 1995 in Turkey. A
comparison of this sequence with published sequences implied that this SSPE
case was associated with a new genetic lineage of MV.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The purpose of the study was the assessment of humoral response
markers in 20 patients with SSPE in phase I, II and III of the disease during
immunomodulating treatment. In the CSF IgG levels were determined by
nephalometric method, with its share in the total protein level, and with
determination of the local IgG synthesis in CNS by Reiber method, 24-hour IgG
synthesis by Tourtellotte-Boce method, IgG index by Link-Tibbling method and
albumin index. Oligoclonal IgG was determined by isoelectrofocusing. All
mathematical tests indicating IgG synthesis in CSF were abnormal in all cases,
and also in all cases oligoclonal IgG was found (type 3 of electrophoresis
separation pattern). The results point to far reaching changes of the humoral
immune response in SSPE persisting also during immunomodulating treatment
independently of disease phase and duration. In only 10% of cases abnormal
values of the albumin index suggested damage to the blood-brain barrier.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have developed a strategy to identify the disease-relevant
antigens in a chronic inflammatory CNS disease exhibiting intrathecally
expressed oligoclonal IgG. Using subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a
chronic inflammatory measles virus infection of the brain as a model system, we
constructed a phage display antibody Fab library from the amplified products of
IgG expressed in the brain. Selection of the library against measles
virus-infected cell lysates yielded four distinct Fabs which, by ELISA and by
immunostaining, reacted specifically with measles virus-infected cells. Three
Fabs immunoprecipitated a 72 kDa protein from infected cell cultures
corresponding to the measles virus phosphoprotein. The fourth Fab
immunoprecipitated and recognized by immunoblotting a 60 kDa protein
corresponding to the measles virus nucleoprotein. The results demonstrate that
functional antibodies from an inflammatory CNS disease can be expressed in
bacteria and used to identify disease-relevant antigens. This approach could be
applied to chronic inflammatory CNS diseases of unknown cause such as multiple
sclerosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Two sibling viruses of the subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) virus Osaka-2 strain were isolated from a small biopsy specimen of the
brain of an SSPE patient just before intraventricular interferon treatment by
cocultivation with two different cell lines, Vero cells or B95a cells (Ogura et
al, 1997). Both the virus-infected cells were found to be indistinguishable
from each other in defective production of cell-free virus and in defective
expression of the matrix (M) protein. The sequence analysis of the M genes
predicted that they were translatable due to a lack of alteration of the
translational start and stop codons for the proteins. A different pattern of
the M monocistronic transcripts, however, was observed in a Northern blot
analysis of the infected cells. This different pattern was confirmed further by
a primer extension analysis. The undetectable expressions of the M proteins in
the sibling virus-infected cells are most probably different in their molecular
mechanisms. All these results indicate the possibility that the two different,
replicable variants existed at Jabbour stage III of the disease's progression
in a very small portion of the brain, where no lesion had yet been recognized
by a magnetic resonance imaging.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The authors report a case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in
a child who had measles during the neonatal period. At 3 years, 6 months of
age, over a period of a few weeks, the patient lost the ability to sit unaided
as a result of progressive truncal ataxia, without apparent cognitive changes,
simulating acute cerebellar ataxia. His symptoms improved in 1 month, and he
was able to walk again with support, but mental alteration and periodic mild
head nodding on awakening followed. His illness was diagnosed as subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis on the basis of the elevated titers of measles
antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid. Measles infection before 1 year of age
is a risk factor of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, but reports about
patients with neonatal measles infection are rare. Immaturity of the brain at
the time of measles infection may not only be a risk factor but may also
influence the clinical course of the disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Measles virus has been implicated in the
etiology of both inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is caused by
atypical measles infection. This study investigated the patterns of infection
that are risks for SSPE, early infection and a close temporal relationship
between measles and another infection, as potential risks for IBD. METHODS: The
data are from 7019 members of a nationally representative 1970 British Cohort
Study. The ages of five childhood infections were recorded before onset of IBD
symptoms. Diagnoses of IBD and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), as a
control disease, were identified by age 26 years. RESULTS: Mumps infection
before age 2 years was a risk for ulcerative colitis (odds ratio, 25.12; 95%
confidence interval, 6. 35-99.36). Measles and mumps infections in the same
year of life were significantly associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease, with odds ratios of 7.47 (2.42-23.06) and 4.27 (1.24-14.46), but not
with IDDM. These relationships are independent of each other as well as sex,
social class at birth, household crowding in childhood, and family history of
IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical paramyxovirus infections in childhood may be risk
factors for later IBD.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In Okinawa, there were ten cases (7 male and 3 female) of subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) from 1970 to 1996. All cases had a history of
measles and none had received measles vaccination. The incidence of SSPE in
Okinawa was 0.31 per million in 1970-1996. Being higher than other districts in
Japan. Two cases contracted measles in 1973 and other three in 1990, showing a
tendency to cluster.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The aim of this study is a clinical and electroencelographic
analysis of those SSPE patients who suffered epileptic seizures in course of
the disease. The material is based on an analysis of a computed database
including 1180 case histories from multiple hospitalizations of 248 SSPE
patients (141 males, 107 females) in years 1978-1995. The analysis was made
using computer system EPI-INFO 6. The average age of SSPE onset was 12.3 +/-
4.5 (range 4-27.5). 74.2% of patients developed the disease before the age of
15. Epileptic seizures occurred in 43.5% (N = 108) of all SSPE patients in
different stages of the disease. In 47 patients (M-21; F-26) they were observed
among first SSPE symptoms, in 41 of those the seizures had the form of GTCS.
Epileptic seizures were more frequent in patients with SSPE onset before the
age of 15 (50.5%) than in patients with later onset (23.4%). More frequent
occurrence of epileptic seizures and epileptiform changes in EEG in children
under 15 can be associated with specificity of developmental age: immaturity of
nervous and endocrine system and decreased convulsant threshold.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The main trends are described in the studies of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis conducted in Poland or abroad with participation of Polish
scientists. The history of these studies began in the years 1957-1959 with the
works of Wender and Osetowska and ends presently at the end of our century with
extinction of SSPE as a result of consistently conducted obligatory
vaccinations against measles. The studies of Polish authors involved the
problems of clinical diagnosis using immunological, electrophysiological and
neurological imaging methods. Neuropathological problems were also studied
extensively. Parallely with similar studies in the foremost foreign centres
trials of SSPE treatment were undertaken in Poland, in recent years by means of
intracerebroventricular administration of interferons. An original Polish
method was the treatment with inducers of endogenous interferons. After the
introduction of vaccinations against measles epidemiological studies repeated
in the whole country were introduced for the assessment of the results of this
preventive measure. These studies are regarded as model ones at international
level.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The Fr/V and Oc/V sibling viruses of the Osaka-1 strain of the
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) virus were defective in cell-free
virus production. By radioimmunoprecipitation assay, the matrix (M) protein was
not detected in cells persistently infected with the Osaka-1 strain. This
undetectable expression was consistent with the selective reduction of antibody
response to the M protein in the patient from whom the Osaka-1 strain was
isolated. The sequence of the M gene, however, predicted that the protein could
be synthesized because the translational start and stop codons for the protein
were not altered. Northern blot hybridization demonstrated the selective defect
of the monocistronic mRNAs for the M protein and the phosphoprotein (P)
together with the dominant presence of the P-M bicistronic mRNA. This absence
of the M mRNA was further confirmed by primer extension analysis. Therefore,
the undetectable expression of the M protein in the infected cells was proved
to be caused by a transcriptional defect. The two sibling viruses, isolated
from remote portions of an SSPE brain, were indistinguishable in their viral
characters, including the M gene sequences, which indicates the possibility of
clonal expansion of the strain in the brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In an autopsy study the distribution of measles virus (MV) in the
central nervous system (CNS) of 18 measles-infected children (13 HIV
seropositive, 5 HIV seronegative), in Abidjan, Ivory Coast was examined using
immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Of these children 17 died from
measles giant cell pneumonia. In 3 of the 13 HIV-seropositive patients MV
antigens and genomic RNA was detected in the CNS. One of these positive
patients had an MV encephalitis with abundant virus throughout most of the CNS.
MV was not detected in the CNS of any of the 5 HIV-seronegative patients. These
findings, albeit in a small number of cases, would suggest there may be an
increased susceptibility to infection of the CNS with MV in HIV-positive
children. In this respect entry and growth of MV in the CNS in HIV-seropositive
individuals may be similar to the occurrence of measles inclusion body
encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, comparison of the
HIV-MV encephalitis patient with two patients with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) demonstrated a paucity of virus in neuronal processes in
the HIV-MV encephalitis. Unlike in SSPE, MV maturation by budding through the
plasma membrane may occur, thereby minimizing build up of and intracellular
movement of incomplete virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In Israel, SSPE has been shown to be much more frequent among
Sephardic Jews and Arabs than among Ashkenazic Jews. In the present study, we
tried to explore environmental factors that may be of etiological importance
and explain these differences in prevalence. The study is a case-control one,
which includes 95 patients and 2 groups of controls, with 95 people in each.
The general population controls were group-matched to the case group by sex,
age, and ethnic origin. The family controls consisted of the sibling closest in
age to each patient. A statistically significant positive correlation was found
between risk of SSPE and early measles infection, large family, overcrowding in
the home, older age of the mother, higher birth order, fewer years of schooling
of the parents, fewer cultural activities, and rural place of birth. All these
factors are interpreted as contributing to a higher risk of early measles
infections, which thus may well be the main risk factor for SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles viruses isolated from brain cells of patients with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) have numerous mutations, especially in the
matrix protein (M) gene. To find whether the M genes of these SSPE viruses were
mutated randomly or in a pattern, we sequenced this gene from three strains of
defective measles virus isolated in Osaka, Japan. We could deduce the sequence
of the possible progenitor measles virus for each patient by comparison of the
isolate with measles viruses prevailing at roughly the same time and place as
the primary infection. Biased hypermutation affected the M genes of all three
SSPE viruses, although the molecular mechanisms for the mutations might be
various. Replacements of U with C in the plus strand accounted for 76% of all
mutations in two of the strains, but in the other strain, replacements of A
with G accounted for 52% of the mutations, and the U residues were unchanged.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A highly sensitive measles-specific RT-PCR-nested PCR system was
established, which consistently amplified measles virus genome sequence from
control samples containing as little as 5.5 x 10(-3) pfu per reaction. This
method failed to detect the presence of measles virus in 93 colonoscopic
biopsies and 31 peripheral blood lymphocyte preparations, examined and obtained
from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and noninflammatory
controls. All patients had detectable levels of serum neutralization antibody
against measles virus. Each biopsy was estimated to have about one million
cells, based on the amplification of the beta actin gene. The assay was
calibrated by use of a known number of lymphocytes. The method applied was able
to amplify measles virus RNA from a nucleic acid mixture equivalent to 18 cells
derived from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) brain material. The
level of measles RNA present, if any, in the biopsies is therefore at least
50,000-fold less than in SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In two patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) of
10 and 25 months duration we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry the presence
of measles-virus nucleocapsid antigen (MVNA) in CD68+ cells and astrocytes of
brain tissues. In both cases, CD68+ hematogenous monocyte/ macrophages and
perivascular microglial cells (Mphi) were found infiltrating the brain
parenchyma, and often partially or completely invested by perivascular reactive
astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Mphi with
cytoplasmic MVNA were often seen in the Virchow-Robin spaces and in close
association with perivascular astrocytes, which often also contained MVNA+
intracytoplasmic inclusions. Reactive astrocytosis was more severe in the
patient with long-standing illness, and a correspondingly elevated number of
strongly GFAP+ MVNA+ or MVNA- perivascular binucleated astrocytes was observed.
An uptake of MVNA+ cell debris by reactive astrocytes was evident in areas of
white matter displaying extensive demyelination and necrosis. Taken together,
these observations seem to indicate that the brain infiltration by Mphi
carrying measles virus could represent one pathway of virus entry and
dissemination in the central nervous system. Virus transfer to perivascular
astrocytes via cell-to-cell contacts with infected macrophages is also
suggested.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 17-year-old male presented with confusion following a mild head
injury. Repeated CT scans of the head were normal. There was a 3 year history
of decreased vision, associated with a focal pigmentary retinopathy. On
assessment he demonstrated visual agnosia and early dementia. An MRI scan
showed symmetrical demyelination of the white matter, particularly of the
occipital lobes. The diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
was confirmed by the typical EEG findings and the presence of measles
antibodies in the CSF. The head injury was the precipitating factor which led
to a diagnosis of SSPE. This disease should be considered in young patients who
have persisting cognitive dysfunction out of keeping with the severity of the
initial trauma. A focal pigmentary retinopathy, especially with macular
involvement, should also raise the possibility of SSPE, despite the absence of
neurological symptoms initially. We report the longest interval to date between
the visual symptoms and onset of neurological signs of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Subacute measles encephalitis (SME), or measles
inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), is a rare central nervous system (CNS)
complication following infection by the measles (rubeola) virus. It usually
occurs in young patients with defective cellular immunity from either
congenital or acquired causes. In the United States, with the resurgence of
measles infection and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, subacute
measles encephalitis should be added to the differential diagnosis in acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients presenting with unexplained CNS
manifestations. CASE: A 2-year-old, HIV-positive, white male was admitted for
generalized convulsive seizures. Vaccination was described as "up to date."
Despite treatment with anticonvulsive drugs, the child continued to develop
frequent partial and generalized seizures. Cephalic computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hypodense area in the right
parietotemporal cortex without an associated mass effect. Fine needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the affected area showed neuronal reduction,
degeneration with eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions, perivascular
lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and gliosis. Electron microscopy of the
intranuclear inclusions revealed fine, fibrillar, tubular nucleocapsids,
consistent with the measles virus. CONCLUSION: Acute measles encephalitis
(AME), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), and SME are the three CNS
syndromes associated with measles infection. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) antibody titres against measles virus are usually high and helpful in the
diagnosis of AME and SSPE. In SME, neither serum nor CSF antibody titres
against measles are high. Therefore, FNAB is necessary for a definitive
diagnosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report a 25-year-old female who developed clinical and
electroencephalographic (EEG) features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) at the age of 17 years. After almost 17 months of progressive
neurological deterioration to a level where she was bedridden and incapable of
self-care (Risk and Haddad stage 3a), she experienced a substantial spontaneous
clinical and EEG remission (stage 4c) which she has maintained for the last 8
years. The measles antibody titer in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), however,
progressively increased during follow-up. There are only very few patients with
well documented diagnosis of SSPE who have maintained such a prolonged
remission. The age at onset of SSPE of &gt; or = 12 years, disappearance of
periodic complexes and a tendency for normalization of the background activity
in the EEG, and a progressive increase in the measles antibody titer in the CSF
appears to predict a favourable outcome of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A patient with SSPE who had prominent diffuse white matter
hypodensities on CT scan indicating central white matter demyelination and
nerve conduction abnormalities suggestive of peripheral neuropathy is reported.
Diagnosis was established by demonstration of elevated CSF measles antibody
titers and presence of virus antigen and nucleocapsid in peripheral nerve. To
our knowledge, this is the first report of demonstration of measles virus
nucleocapsides and antigen in the peripheral nerve in SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The single sspE genes coding for gamma-type small, acid-soluble
spore proteins (SASP) of three round-spore-forming bacteria, Bacillus
aminovorans, Sporosarcina halophila and S. ureae, have been cloned and
sequenced. While the deduced amino acid sequences of these three gamma-type
SASP show clear homology to those from six Bacillus species that do not form
round spores, there are no residues conserved completely among the 9 sequences
known. In addition, the 139 residue B. aminovorans protein is 35 residues
larger than any other while the 60 residue S. halophila protein is one of the
smallest. These data suggest that the sspE genes have been under little
selective pressure in recent evolutionary time.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We studied the effects of two antiviral agents, human
interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and ribavirin, on subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) virus infections in hamsters. By intracranial
administration, IFN-alpha alone improved the survival of infected hamsters by
20% at a dose of 6 x 10(4) IU/kg every other day for 10 days. When the dose of
IFN-alpha was increased incrementally to 6 x 10(6) IU/kg, the survival rate
increased by 70% in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of IFN-alpha and
ribavirin had a synergic inhibitory effect on the replication of SSPE virus in
cell culture. Combination of IFN-alpha (at a dose of 6 x 10(5) IU/kg) with
ribavirin (at a dose of 1 mg/kg) completely prevented mortality. This was
significantly better than either IFN-alpha or ribavirin monotherapy (p &lt;
0.05). Under the conditions used, IFN-alpha did not enhance the toxicity of
ribavirin in hamsters. Intraventricular administration of high dose IFN-alpha
and ribavirin may have potential usefulness in the treatment of patients with
SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report an autopsy-proven case of SSPE in which the course was
rapidly progressive, leading to death in 2 months. The patient was admitted for
investigation of visual symptoms. His examination revealed complete right
homonymous hemianopia and myoclonic jerks in the right half of the body. EEG
showed high voltage periodic slow-wave discharges that were often associated
with jerks. Measles antibody was positive in serum and CSF. MRI showed
hyperintensity in the white matter of the occipital poles. The patient became
completely blind and had jerks in all four limbs. His condition continued to
deteriorate and within 3 weeks he reached a state of deep coma. The myoclonic
jerks became less marked and gradually completely ceased. The EEG showed
diffuse slow activity without periodic complexes. The patient died
approximately 2 months from onset of disease. Brain autopsy revealed severe
neuronal loss with abundant inclusion bodies in the remaining neuronal and
oligodendroglial nuclei, which was compatible with SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The cytoplasmic tail of the measles virus (MV) fusion (F) protein is
often altered in viruses which spread through the brain of patients suffering
from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). We transferred the coding
regions of F tails from SSPE viruses in an MV genomic cDNA. Similarly, we
constructed and transferred mutated tail-encoding regions of the other viral
glycoprotein hemagglutinin (H) gene. From the mutated genomic cDNAs, we
achieved rescue of viruses that harbor different alterations of the F tail,
deletions in the membrane-distal half of the H tail, and combinations of these
mutations. Viruses with alterations in any of the tails spread rapidly through
the monolayer via enhanced cell-cell fusion. Double-tail mutants had even
higher fusion competence but slightly decreased infectivity. Analysis of the
protein composition of released mutant viral particles indicated that the tails
are necessary for accurate virus envelope assembly and suggested a direct F
tail-matrix (M) protein interaction. Since even tail-altered glycoproteins
colocalized with M protein in intracellular patches, additional interactions
may exist. We conclude that in MV infections, including SSPE, the glycoprotein
tails are involved not only in virus envelope assembly but also in the control
of virus-induced cell fusion.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The EEG of a 12-year-old girl with stage II subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE), who had also suffered from a non-progressive mental
retardation of unknown aetiology since early childhood, revealed periodic
generalised stereotyped fast wave bursts synchronous with myoclonic jerks. The
background activity was nearly normal. The diagnosis of SSPE was established by
raised serum and measles antibody titres, raised CSF IgG, and brain biopsy.
This rare type of periodic complex has only once been described in the
literature, again in a mentally retarded child who had developed SSPE. We
suggest a mechanism of origin of this type of periodic complex drawn from
observations in these two cases, and discuss its significance.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is mainly thought of as a
disorder of childhood and adolescence and may not be readily recognized when
presenting later in life. Prior reports have suggested that adult-onset SSPE
may have atypical features. We have added two cases to the existing literature
on adult-onset SSPE, compared them with a more classic juvenile presentation,
and extensively reviewed those reports that were published after the
etiological link with the measles virus had been established. Adult-onset SSPE
patients present at a mean age of 25.4 years (range 20-35 years). They have a
higher proportion of either negative history of measles exposure or
undocumented history by the reporting authors. Those with available history of
measles exposure tend to have it either earlier (younger than 3 years old) or
later (after 9 years) than the usual childhood measles infection. Where the
primary infection is known, unusually long measles-to-SSPE intervals have been
documented, ranging from 14 to 22 years. None of the cases followed measles
vaccination. Visual symptomatology was very frequent, with 8 of the 13 cases
reviewed having a purely ophthalmological presentation; only 2 patients
presented with behavioral changes. Although the course of the disease was
progressive and fatal in the majority, there appeared to be a higher rate of
spontaneous remission as compared with childhood-onset SSPE. Myoclonus, spastic
hemiparesis, bradykinesia, and rigidity were the predominant motor
manifestations. Neuropathology revealed cortical and subcortical gray matter
involvement preferentially of the occipital lobes, thalamus, and putamen. The
importance of recognizing the spectrum of potential presentations of SSPE and
providing an early diagnosis will increase as more effective treatments become
available.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A tentative treatment with Antineoplaston AS2-1 was carried out in a
group of 16 patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Most
patients were in phase II of SSPE (after Jabbour) with mean disease duration
6.4 months. Their age ranged from 13 to 28 years. They were given for 6 months
15 capsules of Antineoplaston AS2-1 and 6 tablets of isoprinosine daily.
Despite that treatment progression was observed of the disturbances of higher
nervous functions, less so of motor functions. The treatment had no effect on
MRI results, EEG and antimeasles antibodies levels. No adverse effects were
observed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Data was collected about 49 newly diagnosed cases of SSPE in the
years 1993-1995 in Poland. In the analyzed period of time a falling of tendency
the incidence of SSPE was maintained. Overall incidence--0.42 per million
population, was lower than the incidence in years 1990-1992, when it was 0.72.
The tendency of a shift towards older age group was maintained--the peak
incidence was observed among 19 year olds, as opposed to 15 year olds in the
previous analyzed time period. The authors explain the dropping SSPE incidence
in Poland with a drop in measales incidence, which is a consequence of growing
measles vaccine coverage rates. The influence of a big measles epidemic which
occurred in 1989-1990 on a potential rise in number of SSPE cases has not been
noted, but further observations are needed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Computer-assisted analysis was done of database containing 1180
records of 249 patients with SSPE hospitalized repeatedly at the I Dept. of
Neurology using the EPI INFO 6 computer system recommended by the WHO. Boys
were slightly prevalent in these cases (58%). The results of the analysis
showed a falling incidence of SSPE among children born after 1976 (increased
mean age of onset and death with successive years and hospitalization period,
but without correlation between the mean age at onset and the birth year,
decreased number of patients born after 1978 and absence of new admissions of
those born after 1984). The falling incidence of SSPE can be a result of the
introduction in 1976 of routine measles vaccination. 80.5% of the patients had
measles, and 70.5% had it in the first two years of life (mean age to onset
2.34 +/- 2.32). Only 29 patients (11.6%) had had measles vaccination, and 15 of
them (6%) had had measles.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Immunoglobulin (Ig) G was purified from soluble and membrane
fractions of postmortem subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) brain,
multiple sclerosis (MS) brain plaque-periplaque white matter, and normal human
brain (NHB) white matter. After homogenization in 0.32 M sucrose and removal of
cell debris and nuclei by low-speed centrifugation, soluble and crude membrane
fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation. After removal of sucrose by
dialysis, IgG was isolated from the soluble fraction by protein A affinity
chromatography. IgG was obtained from the membrane fraction by elution at low
pH and purification from the eluate by protein A chromatography. Whereas very
little IgG was in NHB white matter, significant levels of IgG were recovered
from both SSPE and MS brain. Both immunocytochemical staining of measles
virus-infected cells in tissue culture and protein immunoblotting of
virus-infected cell lysates showed that the IgG from SSPE brain contained
activity specific for measles virus protein. The abundance, purity and
functional activity of IgG extracted from SSPE and MS brain indicate that IgG
extracted from the brain of humans with an inflammatory disease of unknown
etiology can be used to identify its corresponding antigen.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We describe a 3-year-old boy with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) who died 4 months after its onset. His initial symptoms
were drowsiness and left hemiplegia. He became comatose in 10 days, and
developed a decortical posture after 45 days. He suffered from multiple
cerebral hemorrhage and infarction 3 months later. Oligodendrocytes were
positively stained by immunocytochemical stain with a complement-fixing measles
antibody. Light microscopy revealed glial nodules, perivascular cuffing and
reactive gliosis. Small arteries showed intimal thickening with resultant
occlusion and occasional recanalization. These findings suggested vascular
involvement in SSPE. This case illustrates the difference between the fulminant
and chronic forms of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In this study we investigated pathological changes of the expression
of the measles virus (MV) receptor, CD46, in subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) brains. We analyzed CD46 expression in lesions of brain
specimens from five SSPE patients in comparison to uninfected regions of the
same brains and to normal human brains. The correlation between CD46 and MV
infection, in individual cells in SSPE brains, was analyzed by double-staining
procedures using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and in situ hybridization to
detect MV-specific mRNAs. We found that CD46 was expressed at relatively low
levels by neurons and astrocytes in normal brains in comparison to
neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines. Within heavily infected (MV-positive)
brain lesions of all five SSPE cases, CD46 was either not detected or was
expressed to a lesser degree by neural cells, irrespective of whether MV
antigens were detectable or not. In contrast, normal levels of CD46 were found
in SSPE brain tissue distant from the lesion. Using in situ hybridization,
mRNAs of both MV nucleocapsid and MV hemagglutinin (MV-H) were detected in all
SSPE lesions, while no or only small amounts of MV-H protein were detected.
MV-infected neurons were never found to express CD46. Although a strict
correlation between levels of the MV-H protein and the absence CD46 could not
be seen, these findings suggest that the CD46 expression is reduced by the MV
infection in lesions of SSPE brains.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: We measured measles-specific IgA in matched pairs of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sera of patients with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE), multiple sclerosis (MS), other central nervous system
(CNS) infectious diseases (INF) and other neurological diseases (OND) by using
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CSF and sera from 23
patients with SSPE, 15 with MS, 14 with INF, and 15 with OND were included in
the study. RESULTS: The ratios of measles-specific IgA in CSF to serum were
increased in SSPE patients compared to patients with MS, INF or OND.
CONCLUSION: The data indicate a local production of measles-specific IgA in the
CNS of SSPE patients.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus can give three different forms of infections in the
central nervous system. These are acute postinfectious encephalitis, acute
progressive infectious encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). The postinfectious acute disease is interpreted to reflect an
autoimmune reaction. The acute progressive form of brain disease, also referred
to as inclusion body encephalitis, reflects a direct attack by the virus under
conditions of yielding cellmediated immunity. The late progressive form of
encephalitis (SSPE) has been extensively analyzed. Recent molecular genetic
studies have unravelled a range of mechanisms by which a defective expression
of either the matrix, the fusion, or the hemagglutinin proteins may lead to
viral persistence in brain cells under conditions not allowing identification
by immune surveillance mechanisms. Many aspects of virus-cell interactions have
been examined by use of explant cultures of neuronal cells of human and animal
origin. Some of the findings are reviewed. Experimental animals, in particular
rodents, have been used to establish systems in which phenomena, pivotal to the
evolution of acute as well as persistent measles virus infections in the brain,
can be studied. A wide range of potentially important mechanisms has been
highlighted and is discussed. More recently, mice with genetic defects in
immune functions were used to evaluate consequences as to initiation and
dissemination of virus infection in the brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P),
matrix (M), fusion (F), and large protein (L) genes were partly determined for
19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan
(nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L:
10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980. The
phylogenetic trees of these strains drawn for respective genes were very
similar to each other and revealed that all the wild strains were classified
chronologically into 3 subgroups, those isolated in 1984, 1984-1989, and
1990-1994. The SSPE strain was classified into the subgroup of 1984.
Phylogenetic tree analyses including other strains in the world revealed that
Japanese strains in 1984 were classified into a distinct lineage which might
correlate with the European strains from late 1970s to mid 1980s. Japanese
strains from 1984 to 1989 were almost identical to those of the United States
isolated from 1989 to 1992, and Japanese strains in 1990s were related closely
to some of the MV strains isolated in 1994 in the United States. Genetic
recombination among the MV genes seemed not to have occurred.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus has been isolated with
difficulty from brains of infected patients. More strains are needed for the
study of the pathogenesis of this virus. To make the isolation more efficient,
we selected portions to be examined from the brains of three patients with
reference to findings of repeated magnetic resonance and computed tomographic
imaging. Three cell lines susceptible to measles virus field strains were used.
In all three cases viruses were isolated most effectively from recent lesions
and with Vero cells. Our results suggested that these imaging methods and Vero
cells could be used for improvement in the efficiency of isolation of this
virus from patient brains.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: In 1994, first published reports described cystic
fibrosis patients who experienced a then unknown complication-ileocecal and
colonic stenoses with submucosal proliferation requiring surgical intervention.
To investigate a suspected correlation between increased intestinal wall
diameter and high doses of pancreatic enzymes, we carried out a prospective
study in our CF-outpatient clinic. METHODS: By ultrasound analysis we measured
the intestinal wall diameter in 201 patients. One hundred ninety-three patients
treated with pancreatic enzymes had pancreatic insufficiency. Eight patients
showed normal pancreatic function, seven of them had never been treated with
pancreatic enzymes. The control group included 12 healthy children. Measuring
points were the distal ileum, cecum, ascending, and descending colon.
Measurements were made by the longitudinal and cross sectional cut. The
following aspects of the patients' history were recorded (a) current type of
pancreatic enzyme medication; (b) total dosage per day (with reference to
lipase units); (c) duration of therapy with standard-strength pancreatic enzyme
(SSPE) preparations (&lt; or = 10,000 lipase units per capsule) and HSPE
preparations (&gt; or = 20,000 lipase units per capsule); (d) gastrointestinal
complication (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, meconium ileus, abdominal
surgery, intussusception), diabetes mellitus, and hepatobiliary complications.
RESULTS: The intestinal wall diameter in patients receiving HSPE therapy was
greater (with prominent submucosal layer) than that in patients receiving SSPE
therapy or in patients with pancreatic sufficiency. Healthy subjects had the
smallest intestinal wall diameter. There was no correlation between patient
history and increased intestinal wall thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound
detects characteristic ileocecal wall lesions in the majority of cystic
fibrosis patients on pancreatic enzymes. These lesions may lead to
significantly increased ileocecal wall thickness, which is correlated but not
restricted to HSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The extent of apoptotic cell death was examined in central nervous
system (CNS) tissues from three cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). Apoptosis was demonstrated by in situ end-labelling of DNA in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Measles virus and cell types
were labelled by immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization.
Furthermore, bcl-2 expression in SSPE was examined by immunohistochemistry. All
three cases exhibited varying degrees of apoptosis in all CNS areas studied.
Brain tissue from a non-neurological control case did not show any significant
apoptosis. Characterization of cell types demonstrated neurons,
oligodendrocytes, lymphocytes and microglia undergoing apoptosis. A linear
relationship could not be established between virus burden and the extent of
apoptosis in any particular area. Virus-negative cells were observed which were
undergoing apoptosis. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in SSPE was confined to the
infiltrating cell population. These results suggest that apoptosis of various
cell types may contribute to the neuropathogenesis of measles virus infection
in the human CNS, either as a direct effect of viral infection or by
cytokine-mediated responses.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have cloned and sequenced a 24.5 kb region of the Bacillus
subtilis 168 chromosome spanning the sspE and katA genes. The region contains a
ribosomal RNA operon, rrnD, a tRNA gene set, trnD and 17 ORFs, 16 with putative
ribosome-binding sites. Four of the ORFs (ORF2, ORF14, ORF16 and ORF17) match
to known B. subtilis genes (sspE, thiA, senS and katA). Eight of the remaining
ORF products show similarities with proteins present in the databases,
including an ATP-binding transport protein, a glutamate-1-semialdehyde
aminotransferase, a thiol-specific antioxidant protein, a mitomycin radical
oxidase and a ferric uptake regulation protein.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An 8 year old girl presented with progressive change of personality
and spastic ataxia since 4 weeks. A year before she had developed focal
grand-mal-seizures; at this time laboratory and radiologic findings were
normal. The EEG on admission demonstrated marked changes with partially focal,
partially generalized hypersynchronic activity, but no SSPE-typical
Radermecker-complexes. There were no cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a
slightly increased level of protein and a normal glucose. Isoelectric focusing
showed predominantly measles-specific oligoclonal IgG bands in the CSF. In the
magnetic resonance tomography multiple focal white matter lesions in the basal
ganglia as well as in cortical and occipitoparietal regions could be seen. At
the age of two the girl had suffered from measles, the child didn't receive any
vaccination. The combination of history, CSF-, MRI-results and EEG lead to the
diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). After 3 months the
clinical and radiological abnormalities had markedly increased. On the
background of this history SSPE should be considered as differential diagnosis
in patients with changes of personality.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have examined the in situ transcription of leukaemia inhibitory
factor (LIF) in brain tissue from 3 cases of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) and in 2 non-neurological control brains. This has been
compared with expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and
tumour necrosis factor beta (TNF beta) in the same tissues. All of the
cytokines in the study were expressed in cells in the inflammatory infiltrate
as well as in glial cells. LIF mRNA was also found to be expressed in neurons,
in foci where these cells were also virally infected. No hybridization was
found with any of the probes in areas of SSPE brain, which were negative for
measles virus RNA or in the non-neurological control cases, although expression
was demonstrated in the latter by use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). Differentiated, cultured human neuronal cells were also
positive, by RT-PCR, for LIF. This is the first demonstration of LIF expression

ABSTRACT:  AIMS: To determine the specificity of persistent measles virus
infection in intestinal samples from Crohn's disease patients using
quantitative immunogold electron microscopy. To compare the results with
samples from ulcerative colitis, a granulomatous inflammatory control
(tuberculous lymphadenitis), and a positive control. METHODS: Formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease was
reprocessed and stained with antimeasles nucleocaspid protein primary antibody
followed by 10 nm gold conjugated secondary antibody. Tissue samples were taken
from granulomatous and non-granulomatous areas of the intestine. Intestinal
samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, tuberculous lymphadenitis, or
acute mesenteric ischaemia were similarly processed. Brain tissue from a
patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) was used as the
positive control. Duplicate sections of all tissues were processed without the
primary antibody. Stained specimens were examined by electron microscopy.
RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients, 8/9 foci of granulomatous inflammation
and 0/4 foci of non-specific inflammation were positive for measles virus. Of
controls, 0/5 non-inflamed intestinal tissues, 1/8 tuberculous tissues, 1/5
ulcerative colitis tissues, and 1/1 SSPE tissues were positive. Gold grain
counts per nuclear field-of-view in both Crohn's disease granulomas (43.29) and
SSPE (36.94) were significantly higher than in tissues from patients with
ulcerative colitis (13.52) or tuberculous lymphadenitis (15.875), and
nongranulomatous areas of Crohn's disease (4.89) (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p
= 0.0006, respectively), with no significant difference between Crohn's disease
and SSPE (p &gt; 0.1). In both SSPE and Crohn's disease staining was confined
to a small population of cells exhibiting characteristic cytopathology.
CONCLUSION: These data support a role for measles virus in the aetiology of
Crohn's disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare infectious
central nervous system (CNS) disease with a poor prognosis. We reported on the
case of an adolescent girl with SSPE and characteristic periodic
electroencephalographic (EEG) complexes. Her neurological deficits including
generalized myoclonic seizures improved after intraventricular interferon (IFN)
treatment. However, unusual EEG patterns consisting of bisynchronous occipital
spikes preceding periodic complexes developed in follow-up EEGs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  This is a case report of a 10-year-old boy with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE). He initially developed visual disturbance and macular
degenerative changes of the right eye at the age of 8 years, followed by
chorioretinitis of the left eye, and his neurological symptoms deteriorated
rapidly from the age of 10 years. He was diagnosed as having SSPE, as judged on
cerebrospinal fluid examination for measles virus RNA by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the second stage of
Jabbour's classification on admission. Although high intensity lesions were
observed in the right occipital and temporal lobes, especially around the optic
radiation, on T2-weighted brain MRI before the start of intrathecal
interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy, they had disappeared at about two months
after the treatment. Chorioretinitis (and/or macular degeneration) should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of SSPE, permitting early IFN
therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a persistent viral
infection of the central nervous system due to a defective measles virus.
Beginning with progressive cognitive malfunctioning, myoclonus and other less
specific neurologic signs and symptoms, it usually evolves to a vegetative,
decorticated state and death. Disease course and characteristics can be highly
variable. Since the widespread measles vaccination in the Western countries
started in the late seventies and early eighties, the incidence of SSPE has
dropped significantly. Also adult onset is more frequently seen which changes
the field of differential diagnosis. In this article 3 atypical cases of SSPE
are described with peculiarities such as adult onset, pronounced extrapyramidal
involvement, remission and prolonged disease course. Common features of the
disease are emphasized to enable accurate diagnosis which is based on clinical
features, presence of high titers of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSE)
measles antibodies, MRI and EEG.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In this review of the therapy of infectious diseases and immune
mediated nervous system diseases, we summarized the latest reports of antiviral
drugs, immunosuppressants, immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory agents.
Those include, acyclovir, vidarabine for herpes simplex encephalitis,
ganciclovir for cytomegaro virus infection, inosine pranobex for SSPE, steroid
therapy, interferon, plasma exchange and high-dose intravenous gamma globulin
therapy for HTLV-I associated myelopathy, and multiple sclerosis. Diagnostic
application of the PCR and the newly developed neuroimaging techniques, like
diffusion weighted MRI, high speed MRI, and SPECT, we now being introduced to
enable early recognition of viral infection of the CNS. And since speed of
spread of HIV infection through the world, we are needed specific treatment for
HIV infection, and various studies including genetic therapy is going on
today.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP) is a slow virus infection
of the central nervous system. PRP was first reported in 1974, and fewer than
20 cases have been reported since then. All patients were male who were between
the ages of 8 and 21 years at onset, and most had signs of congenital rubella
syndrome. Although PRP may exhibit clinical features resembling SSPE, the age
at onset is much older and the clinical course is more benign. The main
neurological features of PRP are dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and seizures.
Increases in antirubella antibody titer and IgG are found in the CSF and
diffuse atrophy of the brain with ventricular dilatation may be found on MRI.
The pathomechanism of PRP remains unclarified.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is one of the most
important slow virus infection caused by measles virus in human. It have passed
over 20 years since measles virus was found in the brain of SSPE patients.
However, definite etiological mechanism is still unknown. In Japan, number of
SSPE patients are gradually decreasing, but over 5 patients are reported every
year. Recently, the age of onset of SSPE became higher, incubation period from
measles to SSPE onset became to be more prolonged, and serum measles antibody
titers became lower than before. From typical clinical findings, serum and CSF
measles antibody titers and periodic complex high voltage slow waves with
suppression burst, SSPE is suggested. It is not so difficult to make diagnosis.
As the differential diagnosis, epilepsy, brain tumor, metabolic diseases, or
psychological disorders are mentioned. Treatment for SSPE is still
undetermined. At present, it is thought that combined treatment of oral
inosinpranobex (isoprinosine) and intratechal or intraventricular interferon
(IFN) administration is the most effective.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Most of viral encephalitis may demonstrate no specific change on CT
and MR images. Brain swelling, edema, abnormal density (CT) and abnormal
intensity (MR) can be detected in herpes simplex encephalitis and enterovirus
encephalitis (coxsackie, echo, polio). The common finding on CT and MRI in
patients with HIV encephalopathy are atrophy, leukomalacia. Progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) shows multifocal oval or round white
matter T2-hyperintensities on MR images. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) may present slight changes in the subcortical and periventricular white
matter, as well as basal ganglia. Progressive disorder makes widespread T1-low,
T2-high intensity area and atrophy. MRI of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
(ADEM) shows multifocal subcortical hyper intense foci on T2-weighted studies.
The deep white matter, brainstem, thalamus and cerebellum can be affected. Most
of ADEM lesions resolve. Imaging findings of acute lymphocytic meningitis by
echovirus and coxsackievirus are usually normal.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are the major slow virus infections of
humans. SSPE is caused by mutant measles virus after long persistence in the
brain. Its pathogenesis is discussed, based on accumulating data on molecular
properties on measles virus prevalent in the field as well as recent
identification of measles virus receptor. Current situation on the therapy of
SSPE is also described. PML is caused by the infection of oligodendroglia with
persisting JC virus. Its pathogenesis is discussed based on the molecular
properties of the archetype and PML type of JC virus, and on the recent
findings on the involvement of JC virus T antigen in demyelination. Increase in
the incidence of PML in patients with AIDS is discussed in view of the
interactions between HIV and JC virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We describe a young urban boy with atypically fulminant subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). He had measles at 3 years of age despite
receiving measles immunization in infancy. The literature describing acute SSPE
is reviewed and summarized. This report reiterates the need to include SSPE as
a diagnostic possibility in acute encephalopathic processes. The dismal
prognosis of SSPE further emphasizes the need for measles vaccination and
revaccination of all children who are initially immunized at an age of less
than 15 months.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The implied aetiological association of measles virus with Crohn's
disease would be supported by detection of an immune response to infected cells
in affected tissues. This study sought to detect and characterise in situ
immune responses to measles virus in both acutely and persistently infected
tissues, and in particular, Crohn's granulomata. Tissue sections from patients
with Crohn's disease (n = 17), tuberculosis (n = 9), acute intestinal ischaemia
(n = 5), acute measles pneumonitis (n = 2), acute measles appendicitis (n = 1),
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE; n = 1), and measles inclusion body
encephalitis (MIBE; n = 1), were examined. Single and double
immunohistochemical labelling was performed to identify both cytotoxic
lymphocytes (CD8, TIA, perforin, Leu 7, CD45RO, CD45RA) and macrophages (KP1).
The relationship of these cells to measles infected cells was examined by
double immunolabelling with antimeasles virus nucleoprotein antibody. In both
acute measles appendicitis and SSPE, CD8+/TIA cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL)
targeted infected cells. In the cases of Crohn's disease (13/17), MIBE, fatal
pneumonitis, and one tuberculous granuloma, that were positive for measles
virus, infected cells appeared to be targeted by macrophages rather than CTL.
CTL in both tuberculous and Crohn's granulomata were similar in their
peripheral distribution, number, and phenotype. The data suggest that
measles-specific CTL responses may be attenuated in Crohn's disease compared
with acute measles appendicitis and SSPE, and secondly, that an abnormal
macrophage response to persistent measles virus infection of the intestine may
result in granulomatous inflammation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We treated 22 patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) and oral inosiplex
between 1986 and 1991. The follow-up for 56 to 108 months demonstrates a higher
survival rate in these patients compared with those who did not receive
alpha-IFN. However, eight of 11 patients whose condition improved after
alpha-IFN treatment and five of five patients whose condition stabilized after
alpha-IFN experienced neurologic deterioration 6 to 90 months after treatment;
three of 11 and four of five died. The use of inosiplex did not influence the
prognosis. Re-administration of the same regimen was not effective in one
patient. Treatment-induced remissions in SSPE can be temporary, analogous to
spontaneous remissions. Longer treatment with higher doses, or combinations of
drugs, may be required.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis
factor [TNF]-alpha, and IL-6) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(sICAM-1) were measured in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples
from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), multiple
sclerosis (MS), or other neurologic diseases (OND) by ELISA. IL-1beta was
significantly increased in CSF of the SSPE group compared with levels in the MS
or OND group. IL-1beta CSF/serum ratios were higher in the SSPE than in the MS
or OND group. TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were similar in the 3 groups. CSF
sICAM-1 was higher in the SSPE group than in the MS or OND group. sICAM-1
CSF/serum ratios were higher in the SSPE than the OND group. The increased
CSF/serum ratios of IL-1beta and sICAM-1 in SSPE indicate synthesis of IL-1beta
and sICAM-1 in the central nervous system and may be important in the
pathogenesis of disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A previously healthy 8-year-old girl began to experience nightmares,
soon followed by sleeplessness and perceptual abnormalities including visual
hallucinations. She also complained that she had been attacked and possibly
assaulted sexually. Physical investigations were considered to have provided no
relevant abnormality and psychiatric enquiries were begun directed towards
possible sexual abuse. However, the child's mental and physical state continued
to deteriorate and evidence of a progressive organic process was then obtained
from past school reports, review of the initial EEG findings and further EEG
investigations. The latter in particular indicated a diagnosis of SSPE which
was confirmed immunologically. Treatment was ineffective and the child died 7
months after the onset of the illness. The details of the psychological changes
at the onset of SSPE are ill-defined. This case illustrates that they can
include psychotic phenomena but also that the basic nature of the disorder may
be misconstrued as psychological depending on the circumstances.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Plaque-periplaque areas from MS brain tissue were explanted and
propagated in tissue culture. The same in vitro techniques that successfully
rescued measles virus from SSPE brain, papovavirus from PML brain, and HSV from
normal human trigeminal ganglia, were applied. MS brain cells were also
inoculated into chimpanzees, multiple rodent species, and embryonated hens
eggs. No neurologic disease developed in experimentally infected animals, and
no cytopathic effect was observed in explanted cells, or after cocultivation or
fusion of MS brain cells with indicator cells. Further analysis of explanted
and cocultivated cells by indirect immunofluorescence with various antiviral
antisera prepared against viruses associated with post-infectious
encephalomyelitis, as well as antisera to other ubiquitous viruses, failed to
detect viral antigen. Finally, attempts to detect a latent enveloped virus in
MS brain cells by 'superinfecting' MS brain cells in culture with vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) did not reveal a VSV non-neutralizable fraction.
Nevertheless, since oligoclonal bands (OGBs) in the CSF of patients with
chronic infectious diseases of the CNS are directed against the causative
agent, it is likely that OGBs in MS CSF are antibody directed against the agent
or antigen that triggered disease. Although the relevant antibody may be scarce
relative to irrelevant antibody in MS CSF, and only small amounts of an
MS-specific antigen may be present in brain, this report provides a rationale
for strategies proposed in our companion report by Owens et al which will allow
detection of an MS-specific antigen or its cognate RNA in brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The nucleotide sequence of a 9444-bp segment around the 78 degrees
region of the Bacillus subtilis (Bs) chromosome has been determined. Nine
putative orfs were identified. The deduced amino acid sequences of the products
of two of them (yfiJ and yfiK) exhibit high similarity to those of a sensor
protein, DegS, and a transcriptional regulatory protein, DegU, of Bs,
respectively. Three of them (yfiL, yfiM and yfiN) seem to be ABC transporter
genes. One orf (designated as lipB), the closest to the sspE among the nine
orfs, is the second lipase gene in Bs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a neurodegenerative
disease caused by a persistent "slow virus infection" with a mutated measles
virus, is endemic in much of the developing world. Its incidence will increase
in the USA, not only in immigrants, but also because of the 1988-1990 measles
epidemic. This report reviews the pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory
diagnosis, and future perspectives in treatment and prevention.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, slow
virus infection of the brain, caused by the measles virus, attacking children
and young adults. We investigated 15 patients with SSPE by MRI, with 5 normal
and 10 pathological results. In the early period, lesions were in the grey
matter and subcortical white matter. They were asymmetrical and had a
predilection for the posterior parts of the hemispheres. Later, high-signal
changes in deep white matter and severe cerebral atrophy were observed.
Parenchymal lesions significantly correlated with the duration of disease. A
significant relationship between MRI findings and clinical stage was observed
in the 1st year of the disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report a 15 year old girl with a childhood hemiplegia, who
developed a recent progressive intellectual decline associated with elevated
globulins and measles antibody titres in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating a
diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The magnetic resonance
imaging revealed left hemispheric atrophy concordant with a long-standing right
hemiplegia, and electroencephalography exhibited lateralized periodic complexes
(PCs) over the right hemisphere concordant with left-sided myoclonic jerks. The
modification of PCs in our patient due to preexisting damaged cerebral
hemisphere illustrate that a fairly functional cortex and subcortical white
matter are needed for the expression of the PCs of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Recently, scientists interested in diseases of the human brain have
paid much attention to the endothelin group of peptides. Under normal
conditions they are found in some types of neurons and in endothelial cells of
microvessels but not in glial cells. This review focuses on the endothelin
peptides and their involvement in various brain diseases. Particular attention
is paid to their expression in reactive astrocytes seen in many pathological
conditions of the human brain. Endothelin-1 is a very potent vasoconstrictor
which may be involved in the vasospasm occurring in subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Intracerebral injection or application to cerebral arteries in animals will
cause a focal necrosis, apparently due to severe vasoconstriction. Reactive
astrocytes occurring in cases with infarcts, lacunae, Alzheimer's disease,
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) express endothelin-like immunoreactivity. Astrocytes in
vitro may produce, store and release endothelins. To some extent astrocytes
grown in vitro mimic reactive astrocytes in vivo since in cultures astrocytes
are removed from their natural environment which may trigger reactive
responses. Therefore, in vivo reactive astrocytes may produce, store and
release endothelins just as in vitro. If endothelins are released from reactive
astrocytes they may act as mitogens and may influence microcirculation by
inducing vasoconstriction of intracerebral arterioles. In such ways endothelins
may contribute to the final lesions seen in cases with infarcts, lacunae,
traumatic conditions, Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory diseases of the
brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The nucleotide sequence of a 27830-bp DNA segment in the 79
degrees-81 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis genome has been determined.
This region contains 29 complete ORFs including the sspE gene, which encodes a
small acid-soluble spore protein gamma and locates on the one side terminal of
our assigned region. A homology search for the products deduced from the 29
ORFs revealed that nine of them exhibit significant similarity to known
proteins, e.g. proteins involved in an iron uptake system, a multidrug
resistance protein, a chloramphenicol resistance protein, epoxide hydrolase,
adenine glycosylase, and a glucose-1-dehydrogenase homolog.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The ribavirin concentration in hamster brains was measured by a
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system and a bioassay system.
When ribavirin was administered intracranially at a dosage of 10 mg/kg of body
weight per day for 10 days, a dosage which results in 100% survival of hamsters
infected with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) virus and which
inhibits the replication of SSPE virus in hamster brains, the ribavirin
concentration in the brains estimated by HPLC and bioassay was kept higher than
50 micrograms/g for 10 days. The effective concentration in vivo corresponds to
the concentration at which ribavirin completely inhibits the replication of
SSPE virus in vitro. The maximal tolerable ribavirin concentration for hamsters
was calculated to be 150 micrograms/g. Although ribavirin shows toxicity to the
animals at a relatively low concentration (250 to 400 micrograms/g),
intrathecal or intraventricular administration of ribavirin should be explored
for potential use in the treatment of patients with SSPE, while the ribavirin
concentration in cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue should be monitored.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We determined the nucleotide sequences of the coding region for the
M gene in seven strains of measles virus (MV) that were isolated in Japan
between 1984 and 1993. The mutation found among the seven differed from those
of laboratory strains. Many of these mutations were the same as those that are
characteristic of SSPE viruses. Thus, we suggest that the mutations that have
been considered specific to SSPE virus are in fact consensus among prevailing
MV.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We studied the value of long video-split electroencephalographic
monitoring (VSEEG) in detecting myoclonus in nearly SSPE and evaluated the
natural history and outcome-affecting factors. The 32 newly diagnosed patients
had VSEEG to detect myoclonus and its correlations with EEG periodic complexes.
Disease progression was monitored by a special "outcome score'; the chi-square
test and multi-variable statistics analysed the outcome score in relation to
different variables, such as age at onset, sex, duration of symptoms at
presentation, CSF measles antibody titre, type and interval between periodic
complexes (EEG discharges). Myoclonus or atonia occurred in all patients and
was time-related to the EEG periodic complexes; in 32% of patients, myoclonus
or atonia were not clinically evident. The EEG periodic complexes were of 3
types: Type I (16 patients) periodic giant delta waves; Type II (10 patients)
periodic giant delta waves intermixed with rapid spikes or fast activity; and
Type III (6 patients), long spike-wave discharges interrupted by giant delta
waves. Outcome score was associated with symptoms duration (P &lt; 0.01) and
EEG periodic complexes (P &lt; 0.05). Symptom duration was inversely related to
final outcome (multi-variable analysis). Long VSEEG monitoring greatly improves
early diagnosis and detection of subtle atonia or segmental myoclonus.
Prognostic factors were the type of EEG periodic complexes and duration of
symptoms at presentation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Demyelination is a pathological feature that is characteristic of
many diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including multiple sclerosis
(MS), sub-acute sclerosing panencephalomyelitis (SSPE), metachromatic
leukodystrophy and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. While demyelination is a
pathological end-point that is common to all of these diseases, the cellular
and molecular mechanisms responsible for this pathology are very different .
These range from genetic defects that affect lipid metabolism in the
leukodystrophies, cytopathic effects of viral infection in SSPE to the action
of immunological effector mechanisms in MS and the viral encephalopathies.
Irrespective of the initial cause of myelin degradation, many of these
disorders are associated with some degree of CNS inflammation, as indicated by
the local activation of microglia, recruitment of macrophages or the
intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin. Many of these phenomena are now being
duplicated in animal models, providing not only new insights into the
pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases , but also unexpected
interrelationships between the immune response in the CNS and the pathogenesis
of diseases such as Alzheimers disease and HIV encephalopathy. Autoimmune
mediated models of inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease have proved
particularly valuable in this respect as they allow the effects of defined
immune effector mechanisms to be studied in the absence of CNS infection.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have studied the relationship between measles virus and the
accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau (PHF-tau) in nine cases of
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). By assessing the presence of viral
intranuclear inclusions and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in each case, we
found no correlation between presence and amount of measles virus and the
numbers of neurons containing PHF-tau. Immunohistochemical double labeling in a
case with long duration of disease and severe histopathologic change revealed
no strict colocalization of measles virus antigen and PHF-tau throughout
different brain regions. In areas containing both antigens, most neurons
carrying measles virus did not have a tangle and vice versa, eventhough some
colocalization beyond that expected by chance was observed in specific cortical
areas. These results indicate that, although secondary to viral infection, NFT
formation in SSPE is not restricted to cells carrying viral antigen.
Conversely, measles virus infected cells do not necessarily accumulate PHF-tau.
This lack of colocalization at the cellular level, throughout different brain
areas and among different cases suggests that the formation of NFT in SSPE is
not directly induced by the infectious agent. The formation of NFT in this
disease appears to be elicited through a specific type of tissue damage and,
thus, to be an epiphenomenon. This pathogenetic detail may be of interest for
our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in the
pathogenesis of other more frequent neurodegenerative diseases with
cytoskeletal pathology.<p>

ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: To evaluate the progression of CT and MR changes of the
brain in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) as a basis for assessing
the effects of different types of therapy. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with
SSPE were examined, 44 with MR imaging and 42 with CT of the brain on one or
more occasions. A total of 92 MR and 67 CT studies were performed. RESULTS:
Correlation between the clinical status and the MR findings in admission was
poor. Of 20 patients with clinically advanced disease, only 8 had marked MR
abnormalities; 6 had normal or almost normal findings on MR examinations. Two
of 4 patients with clinically mild disease had advanced MR changes. The
progression of the MR findings appeared to follow a constant pattern. The
earliest pathologic finding was focal, high-T2-intensity white matter changes;
later atrophic changes followed. The atrophy lagged behind the white matter
changes and was thus mild when white matter changes were moderate or severe. In
the most advanced stage, when the patient was in a neurovegetative state, an
almost total loss of white matter had usually taken place. At this stage, the
corpus callosum was also thin. Basal ganglia changes, usually involving the
putamina, were seen in one third of patients and cortical gray matter changes
were seen in one fourth of patients examined with MR imaging. In 2 of 20
patients, MR changes regressed in parallel with clinical improvement following
therapy, but in 5 patients clinical improvement was accompanied by progression
of MR changes. CONCLUSION: The progress of MR abnormalities seen in patients
with SSPE seems to follow a constant pattern, but the severity of MR changes
does not always correlate well with the clinical findings. Caution must
therefore be used when evaluating the effects of therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
amplification with labeled-probe hybridization (in situ RT-PCR/LPH) was used to
detect measles virus RNA within formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue
sections from a patient who died with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). Many more infected neurons and oligodendrocytes were detected by in
situ RT-PCR/LPH than by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization alone.
In addition, infection of vascular endothelial cells was demonstrated only by
in situ RT-PCR/LPH. The observation that many cells contained only a few copies
of viral RNA without detectable antigen is consistent with a persistent viral
infection of the central nervous system. In situ RT-PCR/LPH, combining the
sensitivity of PCR with the tissue localization of in situ hybridization,
should prove useful in further studies to detect nucleic acids in situ in the
central nervous system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The distribution of measles virus (MV) antigen and genomic RNA in
the central nervous system (CNS) in 10 cases of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) was determined using optimized immunocytochemistry and
in situ hybridization techniques. As in previous reports neurons and
oligodendrocytes were found to be the most frequently infected cells. It was
confirmed that MV infection in neuronal processes was predominantly dendritic
but there was also some evidence suggestive of occasional axonal involvement, a
finding confirmed by electron microscopy. In addition MV genomic RNA was
detected in neuronal processes, in some cases in the absence of demonstrable MV
antigen. The relationship between myelin destruction and oligodendrocytic
infection suggested that the demyelination may be solely the result of virus
infection. A possible correlation between viral distribution and form and the
clinical duration of disease was examined. Viral antigen and genome were
equally abundant in the cerebral cortex in most short duration cases (&lt;6
months). However, in two of these cases viral RNA but not antigen was detected
in the spinal cord. In long duration cases (&gt;36 months) viral RNA was
abundant in all areas of the CNS examined, frequently in the absence of
demonstrable antigen. These findings may suggest viral spread in a
cephalo-caudal direction, probably by transneuronal spread.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Lack of major histocompatibility class I antigens on neurons has
been implicated as a possible mechanism for viral persistence in the brain
since these antigens are required for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte recognition of
infected cells. In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), measles virus
(MV) persists in neurons, resulting in a fatal chronic infection. MHC class I
mRNA expression was examined in formalin-fixed brain tissue from 6 SSPE
patients by in situ hybridization. In addition MHC class I protein expression
in MV-infected neurons was examined in experimental Subacute Measles
Encephalitis (SME) by double immunohistochemistry. MHC class I mRNA expression
was found to be upregulated in SSPE tissues studied, and in 5 out of 6 cases
the expression was definitively seen on neurons. The percentage of neurons
expressing MHC class I mRNA ranged between 20 to 84% in infected areas. There
was no correlation between the degree of infection and expression of MHC class
I molecules on neurons. Importantly, the number of neurons co-expressing MHC
class I and MV antigens was markedly low, varying between 2 to 8%. Similar
results were obtained in SME where 20 to 30% of the neurons expressed MHC class
I but &lt;8% co-expressed MHC class I and MV antigens. Perivascular
infiltrating cells in the infected regions in SME expressed IFNgamma
immunoreactivity. The results suggest that MV may not be directly involved in
the induction of MHC class I on neurons and that cytokines such as IFNgamma may
play an important role. Furthermore, the paucity of neurons co-expressing MHC
class I and MV antigens in SSPE and SME suggests that such cells are either
rapidly cleared by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), or, alternatively, lack of
co-expression of MHC class I on MV infected neurons favors MV persistence in
these cells by escaping CTL recognition.<p>

ABSTRACT:  I reported an experience of my family which had a child with a
severe chronic neurological disease (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE)
and activities of private groups to support children with intractable diseases
and their families in Japan. Home care system for these handicapped children is
very important and meaningful to increase "quality of life" of them and their
families. However, their families have to have a lot of physical, psychological
and economical stress to perform it. We cannot say that the present supporting
system in medical and welfare fields in Japan is sufficient yet. Japan Welfare
of Children and Families Association is a foundation to support children with
intractable diseases and their families. This Association has done telephone
counselling for their families, symposium for the care of them, summer camp for
these children and publishing newsletters. However, it is very difficult to
gather volunteers and donations as compared with those in other countries. The
reason is not only the differences of culture or religion, but also the tax
system. In Japan, a donation to a private non-profit group is not tax-free
unlike the United States or other countries. We have to do many things to
support these children and their families.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) had largely disappeared
from the United States because of nearly universal measles vaccination, but it
has reemerged in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two
children with SSPE are described. The first was HIV positive and presented with
seizures and encephalopathy at the age of 21 months. The second developed
myoclonus and dementia at age 4 years; she was not infected with HIV, but her
mother had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging
findings were nonspecific and could have been compatible with HIV
encephalopathy. Electroencephalography was characteristic of SSPE, showing
high-voltage, periodic slow-wave complexes and background slowing. The
diagnosis of SSPE was confirmed by brain biopsy or high measles antibody titers
in the cerebrospinal fluid.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We compared the intracellular processing of the fusion (F)
glycoproteins of an acute measles virus (MV) Nagahata strain and its relative
Biken strain that caused subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), Nagahata
strain synthesizes a precursor F0 which acquires three asparagine (N)-linked
oligosaccharide chains sequentially in 1 h. One oligosaccharide chain on the
partially glycosylated F0 is less accessible to
endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo-H) but becomes accessible as the
protein becomes fully glycosylated, suggesting a protein conformational change.
Biken strain SSPE virus synthesizes a similarly glycosylated F0. However, one
oligosaccharide chain on the Biken F0 remains less accessible to endo-H even
after the protein is fully glycosylated. The Nagahata F0 is cleaved into the F1
and F2 subunits with a half life of 1 h. The Biken F0 is cleaved with a half
life of 4 h. We cloned the F genes of Nagahata and Biken strains and showed by
transfection that the defect causing delayed cleavage of F0 resides in the
Biken F gene. Sequence analysis predicts a mutation in the cleavage recognition
sequence, a truncated carboxyl-terminus, and multiple mutations in F1 of the
Biken F protein. Expression of chimeric F genes showed the mutated cleavage
recognition sequence and the carboxyl-terminal truncation do not delay cleavage
of F0. Instead, delayed F0 cleavage is due to multiple mutations in the
extracellular domain of F1, and four amino acid substitutions near the
transmembrane region impair endo-H access to the oligosaccharide chain. These
results provide detailed information on the normal maturation process of the F
protein of MV and additional clues to the mechanisms of MV persistence in the
CNS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  It has been postulated that the cellular double-stranded (ds) RNA
adenosine deaminase enzyme is responsible for biased hypermutation during
persistent SSPE measles infections in humans. As a test of this hypothesis we
studied the effect of negative-strand RNA virus infection on enzyme activity.
The adenosine deaminase activity was found in nuclear extracts of both
uninfected CV-1 and A549 cells and in cytoplasmic extracts of A549, but not
CV-1, cells. During measles or Sendai virus infection of either CV-1 or A549
cells the adenosine deaminase activity in the nucleus remained fairly constant
up to 24 h post infection, and there was no apparent re-partitioning of the
enzyme between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Transcription complexes of Sendai
virus in vitro or measles virus in vivo did not serve as substrates for the
enzyme. These data suggest that even though some portion of the adenosine
deaminase enzyme may be present in the cytoplasm of at least some cells during
virus infection, modification of the viral RNAs by this enzyme, if it occurs at
all, must be at a very low level not directly detectable by biochemical
analysis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  By means of RT-PCR, a portion of measles virus (MV) mRNA encoding
nucleoprotein (NP) could be detected in 11 (18%) of 61 brain tissue samples
obtained from administrative autopsy cases, who apparently had not suffered
from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)-like central nervous system
disorders. Most of the brain-derived NP sequences showed significant
asynonymous nucleotide substitutions when compared with wild-type MV isolates
and SSPE virus. Our present results suggest that MV commonly persists in the
human brain without causing apparent clinical symptoms, probably due to
decreased virus replication.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 20-year-old man who had developed involuntary movement of his left
hand and memorial disturbance visited our hospital in December, 1991. On
admission, myoclonus, dementia and speech disturbance were recognized. He was
diagnosed as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) based on a high titer
of serum anti-measles antibody (1/256), serum anti-measles-IgG antibody (&gt;
1/4,800) and typical EEG fiding of periodic synchronus discharge (PSD). Inosine
pranobex was administrated orally (4,800mg per day). Serial cranial magnetic
resonance imagings (MRI) were taken since January, 1992 to June, 1994. No
abnormal finding was demonstrated until April 16, 1992 in MRI, but 123I-IMP
SPECT detected decreased accumulation in parietal to occipital lobes on early
image in February 5, 1992. Marked high signal area on T2 weighted image in
right temporal lobe and parieto-occipital lobe were firstly demonstrated in
June 22, 1992 on MRI. These high signal lesions alternated the areas and
locations, but the changes were not related to his clinical symptom. These
findings may suggest ischemic changes after demyelination. His symptoms have
been improving gradually since June, 1994. To our knowledge, 42 cases of
adult-onset SSPE were reported so far (5 were in Japan). This case is the first
report in the world on adult-onset SSPE serially observed with MRI and SPECT
since early stage.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) RNA is present in endothelial cells (Ec) in brain
tissue from cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and relatively
high titres of infectious virus are produced in human cerebral Ec in vitro.
Infection of Ec at the blood-brain barrier could therefore provide the
opportunity for entry of virus to the CNS. Adhesion of syngeneic splenocytes to
MV infected murine (Balb/c) cerebral Ec is found to be upregulated. Increased
expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, following virus infection at the
blood-brain-barrier, may be an important mechanism in inducing inflammatory
infiltration of the CNS in SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A total of 72 EEGs from 57 patients with SSPE were studied. The EEG
studies in SSPE revealed periodic high amplitude complexes in all except one.
Besides periodic complexes, we found several atypical EEG findings including
frontal rhythmic delta activity in intervals between periodic complexes,
electrodecremental periods following EEG complexes, diffuse sharp waves and
sharp-and-slow-wave complexes over frontal regions, and focal abnormalities,
such as sharp wave and sharp and slow wave foci, which have been rarely
reported previously. We also described a new finding characterized by high
amplitude generalized rhythmic sharp wave activity following periodic complexes
in one patient.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The authors summarize the results of the fifth stage of
epidemiological investigation on SSPE. The first stage covered the years
1971-1976, the next stages covered the periods: 1977-1983; 1984-1986;
1987-1989. In the period 1990-1993 data on 95 patients with SSPE were obtained.
Morbidity rates continued to show a decreasing tendency (from 0.8 to 0.6 per
1,000,000 population) in the years 1990-1993, being lower the median morbidity
(amounting to 0.98) in 1985-1989. Morbidity rates continued to shift towards
older age groups: while the peak morbidity (25.7%) in the years 1990-1992 was
noted in the 14-15 age range, in 1993 the peak (28.6%) was found in the age
group of 16 to 19 years.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In biopsic material collected from the frontal cortex of 6 patients
with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and 5 patients with posterior
fossa tumors, we estimated the neuronal and synaptic numerical densities as
well as the mean volume of the neurons from layers II and III. The thickness of
these layers was also determined. The evaluation of the layer's thickness
suggested that there was no difference in the shrinkage in SSPE as compared to
controls. No differences were found between the neuronal numerical densities
and the neuronal soma sizes from SSPE and controls. Conversely the synaptic
numerical density was reduced in SSPE. Given the maintenance of the neuronal
numerical density in the frontal cortex of patients with SSPE, the presence of
a decreased density of synapses must be regarded as a consequence of the
dendritic and axonal degeneration that we previously described in this
condition. It must then be borne in mind that SSPE's functional and behavioral
changes might spring from alterations of the frontal cortex neuronal
circuitry.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Both neurons and oligodendroglia are preferentially infected in
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Massive argyrophilic and
tau-positive glial fibrillary tangles (GFT) were found in oligodendroglia in
two autopsy cases of SSPE with neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). GFT shared common
phosphorylated tau-epitopes with NFT, but were negative for ubiquitin. Electron
microscopically, GFT consisted of compact bundles of irregularly woven tubules.
Thus, GFT in SSPE differed from NFT showing regular constriction of tubules and
from GFT in some other cytoskeletal disorders in which GFT reportedly consisted
of straight tubules.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report the use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aequorea
victoria to visualize cell-specific gene expression and protein subcellular
localization during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Sporangia bearing the
gene (gfp) for the green fluorescent protein fused to genes under the control
of the sporulation transcription factor sigma F exhibited a forespore-specific
pattern of fluorescence. Forespore-specific fluorescence could be detected with
fusions to promoters that are utilized with low (csfB) and high (sspE-2G)
efficiency by sigma F-containing RNA polymerase. Conversely, a mother
cell-specific pattern of fluorescence was observed in sporangia bearing a
transcriptional fusion of gfp to a spore coat protein gene (cotE) under the
control of sigma E and an in-frame fusion to a regulatory gene (gerE) under the
control of sigma K. An in-frame fusion of gfp to cotE demonstrated that GFP can
also be used to visualize protein subcellular localization. In sporangia
producing the CotE-GFP fusion protein, fluorescence was found to localize
around the developing spore, and this localization was dependent upon SpoIVA, a
morphogenetic protein known to determine proper localization of CotE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  It was shown previously that spores and vegetative cells of Bacillus
sphaericus (Bf) and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) are very sensitive
to osmotic variations. Since spore osmotolerance has been associated with their
SASP (small acid soluble spore proteins) content coded by ssp genes,
hybridization assays were performed with sspE and sspA genes from B. subtilis
as probes and showed that Bti and Bf strains could lack an sspE-like gene. The
B. subtilis sspE gene was then introduced into Bti 4Q2 strain; spores were
obtained and showed a 65 to 650 times higher level of osmotolerance to NaCl,
without affecting other important properties: hypoosmotic resistance in
vegetative cells, spore UV resistance, and larvicidal activity against diptera
larvae.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Recent effective treatments for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) are oral inosiplex and intrathecal interferon therapy. The former seems
to be effective for life expectancy but not for neurological disability, and
the latter is a debating antiviral treatment although favorable reports are
increasing. A 12 year-10 month-old boy with SSPE was presented as a successful
case of prolonged effectiveness in both neurological symptoms and life
expectancy. There are no significant side effects by the 200 weeks treatment of
intrathecal alpha-interferon of large dose (6 million unit/dose/week) and
ordinary dose of inosiplex (100 mg/kg/day). Neurological disability index
(Dyken) improved from 70% to 10%; speech and higher cerebral functions improved
from aphasia and almost vegetative states to verbal communicable level; motor
dysfunction from bedridden to wheel chair level; and myoclonic and other
seizures were controlled. Laboratory data also improved; periodic synchronized
discharge (PSD) and other paroxysmal discharges disappeared and alpha activity
that had once disappeared in the background activity of active stages
reappeared in the EEGs. Measles antibodies in serum and CSF improved, and
oligoclonal bands disappeared. However diffuse brain atrophy remained on
neuroimaging. Long-term intrathecal large dose treatment with alpha-interferon
is effective and safe. It should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made,
and a trial of large-dose and long-term therapy may be worthy even for more
advanced cases irrespective of progress of neuroimages.<p>

persistently infected with measles/SSPE virus (C6/SSPE cells). Transfected Vero
cells infected with MV showed a drastically reduced yield of infectious virus
(90-99.99%). In plaque assays, plaque numbers and plaque size were
significantly reduced compared with untransfected Vero cells. With an unrelated
control virus, VSV, no effects were seen in the transfected Vero cells,
underlining the specificity for MV. Following stable transfection with MV
antisense vectors, C6 rat glioma cells, which are normally suitable to
establish persistently MV-infected lines, can no longer be infected with the
virus. In this case also, VSV infection was not influenced. Furthermore,
antisense transfection of already persistently infected C6/SSPE cells leads to
a loss of MV-specific immunofluorescence, concomitant with a disappearance of
viral RNA. Single cell clones from the antisense-transfected C6/SSPE cells
appear to be totally free of virus in cocultivation with Vero cells, suggesting
that they are really cured. The effectiveness of even low amounts of antisense
sequences suggests that they are good candidates for antisense oligonucleotide
therapy in tissue culture and might eventually also be useful for in vivo
application.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether exposure to a measles epidemic in
utero or in infancy is a risk factor for the development of Crohn's disease,
and to determine whether such an association can be found in individuals with
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a condition in which early
infection with measles is known to be of aetiological importance. METHODS: A
postal questionnaire was sent to 16,875 members of two national inflammatory
bowel disease patient support groups. A control group was composed of friends
or neighbours. Birth data were compared with the dates of measles epidemics and
six possible periods of susceptibility were examined. Birth data from a
national register of patients with SSPE were analysed similarly. Previously
identified risk factors were also examined. RESULTS: The answers from 2522
members and 2379 controls were analysed. We found no evidence of an association
between the development of Crohn's disease and exposure to a measles epidemic.
The birth dates of both groups were distributed normally throughout the year.
No other early risk factor for the development of inflammatory bowel disease
was detected. Exposure to a measles epidemic before the age of 1 year did not
emerge as a risk factor for SSPE. CONCLUSION: These data contradict reports
from a recent study in central Sweden, but relatively early exposure to measles
in childhood may still be a risk factor for the development of Crohn's
disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Persistent infections of C6 rat astrocytoma cells with measles
(subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [SSPE]) virus (C6/SSPE cells) or canine
distemper virus (C6/CDV cells) cause a loss of endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding to
its specific receptors (ETRA type) and subsequent ET-1-induced Ca2+ signaling.
It was the aim of this study to investigate the underlying mechanism of this
phenomenon in more detail. By using an RNase protection assay, it was found
that ETRA mRNA disappears, whereas other cellular mRNA species, e.g.,
beta-actin mRNA, were not influenced. The data show that the loss of the ET-1
signaling pathway in C6/SSPE and C6/CDV cells is due to a receptor
downregulation at the transcriptional level.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The characteristic disease features of measles--fever and rash--are
associated with the immune response to infection and are coincident with virus
clearance. MV-specific antibody and CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are generated
and contribute to virus clearance and protection from reinfection. During this
same phase of immune activation immunologic abnormalities are also apparent.
There is a generalized suppression of cellular immune responses that may
contribute to increased susceptibility to other infections. Autoimmune disease
may appear in the form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. If
virus-specific immune responses are inadequate infection may progress with
pulmonary or CNS manifestations, but without a rash. The pathogenesis of the
rare disease SSPE, that occurs many years after primary infection is not clear,
but immune responses show increased antibody to measles and cellular immune
responses similar to those seen after uncomplicated infection.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A simple and sensitive method for the detection of measles virus
genome was developed, amplifying the regions encoding the nucleocapsid (N)
protein and hemagglutinin (H) protein of measles virus by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We examined a variety of
measles patients: 28 patients with natural infection, 4 with measles
encephalitis and 1 with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). In 28
patients with natural measles infection a single step PCR amplifying the N
region resulted in a high detection rate for all plasma samples (28/28) within
3 days of the onset of rash and 80% (20/25) even on day 7 of the onset of rash
and later. Within 3 days of the onset of rash, 24/25 (96.0%) of nasopharyngeal
secretions (NPS) and 27/28 (96.4%) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were positive for the N region PCR and the positivity rate of PCR decreased in
NPS and PBMC after 7 days of the rash. In acute measles infection, measles
genome was detected in all cell fractions, CD4, CD8, B cells, and
monocytes/macrophages by the H gene nested PCR. Measles genome was also
detected from cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) in patients with measles encephalitis,
SSPE, and acute measles by the H gene nested PCR. PCR products of the N and H
regions were sequenced and we confirmed the presence of measles genome. Based
on the sequence data, chronological sequence differences were observed over the
past 10 years. The sequences obtained from the SSPE patient were closely
related to those of the wild viruses that were circulating at the time when the
patient initially acquired measles. RT-PCR for NPS, PBMC, CSF, and plasma
provides a useful method for the diagnosis of measles and molecular
epidemiological study in addition to virus isolation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The nucleotide sequences of the large protein (L) gene derived from
two wild-type measles viruses (MV) and two SSPE brain-derived viruses have been
determined. All sequences have single large open reading frames encoding 2183
amino acid residues. The deduced L proteins are well conserved and the proposed
functional domains which have been identified for rhabdo- and paramyxoviruses
are completely conserved in all strains. The degree of variability of L
proteins is the lowest of all structural proteins of MV, reflecting its role in
virus reproduction and persistence. Biased hypermutation was not observed in
the L genes derived from SSPE brain tissue. None of the nucleotide changes can
be associated with the attenuated phenotype of the Edmonston vaccine viruses.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: A primary ocular manifestation of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis is known and can progress to severe visual deterioration. The
rare occurrence of the disease makes diagnosis often difficult. CASE REPORT:
The lethal clinical course of a patient with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) is presented. The disease manifested itself with severe
ophthalmic symptoms preceding clinical and neurological signs and leading to
bilateral blindness. The dramatic drop of visual acuity was due to a unilateral
and later in the course bilateral pigmentepitheliopathy of the posterior pole.
Inflammatory signs of retinal vasculature or inner retinal layers were detected
neither clinically nor by fluoresceine angiography. A typical blockage of
background fluorescence was demonstrated in fluoresceine and indocyanine
angiography. Within two weeks after initial symptoms optic atrophy developed in
both eyes. CONCLUSION: The primary lesion of retinal pigment epithelium and
outer retinal layer were the prominent findings in this case. The presence of
an outer retinitis of the posterior pole should alert the physician to the
possibility of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The nucleotide sequence encoding the C terminus of the nucleocapsid
protein of measles virus (MV) is the most variable in the genome. The sequence
of this region is reported for 21 new MV strains and for virus RNA obtained
from cases of subacute panencephalitis (SSPE) tissue. The nucleotide sequence
of a total of 65 MV strains has been analysed using the CLUSTAL program to
determine the relationships between the strains. An unrooted tree shows that
eight different genotypes can be discerned amongst the sequences analysed so
far. The data show that the C-terminal coding sequence of the nucleocapsid
gene, although highly variable between strains, is stable in a given strain and
does not appear to diverge in tissue culture. It therefore provides a good
'signature' sequence for specific genotypes. The sequence of this region can be
used to discriminate new imported viruses from old 'endemic' strains of MV in a
geographical area. The different genotypes are not geographically restricted
although some appear to be the mainly 'endemic' types in large areas of the
world. In global terms there appears to be at least four cocirculating
genotypes of MV. The low level of divergence in the Edmonston lineage group
isolated before 1970 indicates that some isolates are probably laboratory
contaminants. This applies to some SSPE isolates such as the Halle, Mantooth
and Horta-Barbosa strains as well as some wild-type isolates from that
period.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In 25 patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in various
phases of the disease CT and NMR imaging of the brain were done at the same
times and the findings were related to clinical symptomatology. NMR imaging, in
contrast to CT imaging, demonstrated even very small brain changes in the
initial stage. The inflammatory-demyelinizing process begins in SSPE as a rule
in the white matter of the occipital lobes, and only later in appears in the
vicinity of the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. Spreading of
subcortical changes in the occipital lobes and their later penetration into the
parietal lobes causes the development of ideatory apraxia frequent in these
cases, and involvement of the cortex of the occipital lobes leads to visual
agnosia. The paresis of extremities in later stages not always are correlated
with greater intensity of changes in the contralateral cerebral with greater
intensity of changes in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Hydrocephalus
developing after longer duration of the disease is an expression of
postinflammatory brain atrophy and not of disturbances in cerebrospinal fluid
absorption.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Neurofibrillary tangle formation, a cardinal characteristic of
Alzheimer's disease, is also a feature of several other neurodegenerative
disorders, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). In the present
study the association of measles virus genome with neurofibrillary tangle
formation has been studied in five cases of SSPE, using in situ hybridization
(measles genome) and immunocytochemistry (tau, ubiquitin and beta/A4 amyloid).
In two cases with duration of disease less than one year, neurofibrillary
tangle formation was not observed. However, in those cases in which the disease
was of several years duration, numerous tau- and ubiquitin-positive
neurofibrillary tangles were demonstrated. In the two cases of longest
duration, double-labelling techniques demonstrated the frequent association of
neurofibrillary tangle formation with neuronal measles virus genome positivity.
Immunocytochemistry for beta/A4 amyloid failed to demonstrate amyloid in any of
the five cases. These findings support the hypothesis that neurofibrillary
tangle formation can occur independently of amyloid formation and that this
mechanism may operate in both Alzheimer's disease and in virally-induced
disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An early increase in activity of biotinidase in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) during the course of acute Staphylococcus aureus meningitis in a
subject with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is reported. A possible
role of CSF biotinidase in the hydrolysis of specific opioid neuropeptides
during acute inflammatory processes involving the CSF-central nervous system
compartment is suggested.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is related to "defective"
measles virus or vaccination, though an association with parainfluenza viruses
has been reported. SSPE is characterized by a slow, erratic course and elevated
cerebrospinal fluid measles titers. An immunocompetent, vaccinated infant, with
onset of symptoms in parainfluenza virus season and a catastrophic course is
described. Cerebrospinal fluid titers were negative, but postmortem brain had
typical SSPE lesions. Patient brain-derived RNA, subjected to reverse
transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction yielded polymerase chain
reaction products with measles virus but not parainfluenza virus genes. The
sequenced fragment revealed multiple mutations, typical for SSPE. SSPE can thus
present in infants, with short latency and no cerebrospinal fluid antibodies.
Viral genomic analysis may be diagnostic, permitting early therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In order to investigate the expression of endothelin-like
immunoreactivity in astrocytes of viral infections of the human brain the
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method and a polyclonal antiserum were used.
Autopsy material was obtained from 5 cases of herpes simplex encephalitis, two
of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and two of subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). All the 5 herpes simplex encephalitis cases
presented groups of immunoreactive astrocytes around necrotic, inflammatory
lesions. The PML cases exhibited a large number of immunoreactive astrocytes in
and around lesions of the white matter. The cases of SSPE disclosed numerous,
markedly stained fibrillary immunoreactive astrocytes; they were most abundant
in degenerated regions of the white matter. The processes and peripheral
cytoplasm of giant astrocytes in the PML cases contained immunoreactive
material but the perinuclear region was devoid of such material. In the herpes
simplex and the SSPE cases immunoreactivity was present throughout the
cytoplasm and processes of reactive fibrillary astrocytes. Many nerve cells in
the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and pons of control cases
exhibited endothelin-like immunoreactivity but this occurred in only
exceptional astrocytes of control cases. Endothelin-like immunoreactivity was
not present in the oligodendrocytes and vascular endothelial cells of controls
and cases of virus infection. The expression of endothelin-like
immunoreactivity in astrocytes in human viral diseases reflects probably an
increased intracellular content of endothelin. If this peptide is released from
such astrocytes, it may act as a mitogen and by inducing constriction of
arterioles it may influence the microcirculation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The analysis of disease courses and survival times of 132 cases of
SSPE treated by various methods in the I Department of Neurology, Institute of
Psychiatry and Neurology, in years 1980-1989 is reported. Follow-up data were
obtained during control examinations of patients or from an inquiry answered by
parents or doctors at the place of residence of the patients. In the treatment
all patients were given immunomodulating drugs. About 25% of the patients were
treated with isoprinosine, in the remaining groups other drugs active on the
immune system were added: TFX, alpha interferon (intraventricularly through a
Rickham chamber), beta interferon (through lumbar tap) or Propionibacterium
granulosum strain K 14 vaccine as an inductor of endogenous interferon. The
reference group comprised 22 patients who had not been systematically treated
for various reasons. The statistical analysis of the clinical courses showed
that early begun immunomodulatory treatment increases the number of cases with
remissions in the group of patients with the subacute form of the disease. In
primarily acute cases no effect of the treatment was noted. The best results
were obtained using Propionibacterium granulosum vaccine and treating with
interferons. The survival times were shortest in the group not treated
systematically.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We analyzed frozen brain specimens from three patients with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) for the presence of interleukin (IL)-1 beta,
IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin (LT), and interferon
(IFN)-gamma using immunocytochemical techniques. We detected these cytokines in
SSPE brain lesions demonstrating extensive cellular infiltrates, demyelination,
and gliosis. Double-label immunocytochemistry, using cell-specific markers,
showed that positive immunoreactivity for these cytokines was present on both
infiltrating cells and resident brain cells. We also found IL-6, TNF, and
IFN-gamma at lower levels in brain tissue from a patient with progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In contrast, normal control brain sections
showed no reactivity for any of the cytokines. These findings indicate that
IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, TNT, LT, and IFN-gamma may be produced in SSPE lesions
and may be involved in the lesion pathogenesis of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The immunomodulatory action of inosiplex, a drug frequently used in
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), varies according to its dose and
the subjects' immune status. In order to assess its effect in children and
adolescents with SSPE, inosiplex (25-50 mg/kg/day) was given to 9 patients aged
7-17 years. Their clinical and immunologic status was evaluated before and
after 2 months' treatment. Lymphocyte mitogenic response decreased in 6 cases.
These patients were clinically stable or improving during this period. Changes
in cytotoxicity (increased in 5/6 patients) and suppressor cell function
(increased in 4/8 and decreased in 4/8) were not significant nor associated
with any particular clinical course. Our results suggest that inosiplex at this
dose is more likely to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in SSPE and this is
not due to advancing disease. Longer follow-up of clinical and laboratory
findings seems to be indicated in therapeutic trials in SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In the cerebrospinal fluid of two groups of patients with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), the determinations of LTB4 and LTC4
leukotriene concentrations were performed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). In the
first group of 10 patients with chronic SSPE (from 2 to 11 years), the LTB4 and
LTC4 levels were 94.8 +/- 17.0 and 97.4 +/- 16.8 pg/ml respectively, and were
significantly higher than those in six patients with discopathy, epilepsy and
headache (p &lt; 0.01). In the second group of 10 patients with beginning SSPE
(disease duration from 1 to 11 months) LTB4 level was lower (was not different
from that in the control group), while LTC4 concentration was 97.6 +/- 10.8
pg/ml and again was significantly raised. Higher LTB4 and LTC4 levels in the
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with SSPE indicate that these compounds
participate in chronic inflammatory reaction around cerebral veins.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The immune function as well as anti-measles virus antibody level
were investigated with 111 children in Karachi who were classified into high-,
middle- and low-income groups. No difference in the blood cell counts or the
biochemical data among three groups indicates no marked difference in the
general health conditions among them. In the low-income group, levels of IgG,
IgA and anti-measles virus antibody were significantly higher than those in the
other two groups. Although 30% of children of the low-income group kept
extremely high levels of immunoglobulin, no significant correlation was
observed between IgG levels and anti-measles virus antibody levels. In the
high-income group, the level of IgM was significantly lower and the incidence
of anti-measles virus antibody-negative children was high (7/38; 18.4%). These
antibody-negative children kept lower immunoglobulin levels although they were
over four years old. These results suggest that the living environmental
conditions of these different socioeconomic groups vary greatly and hygienic
conditions must influence the chance of encountering infectious pathogens
including measles virus. The relation between living environment and risk of
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in child population of Krachi is
discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Between 1989 and 1992 (to October), 65 patients of subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis were referred to the Virology Laboratory of the
National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi, from the major hospitals of
Delhi. The cases were mainly residents of Delhi, but a few were from states
bordering Delhi. The age group of affected cases ranged from 2 to 24 years. The
disease (SSPE) was six times more common in males than in females. All but four
patients below 3 years of age gave a past history of measles. No patient had
history of measles vaccination. The titres of haemagglutination inhibition
antibodies (HAI) to measles virus in serum of SSPE patients ranged from 1:8 to
1:2048 and in CSF it ranged from 1:4 to 1:64, while in the control group it
ranged from 1:2 to 1:256 in serum and nil in CSF. The geometric mean titres in
serum was 10-fold higher in serum and four-fold higher in CSF from SSPE cases
as compared to control.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The immunohistochemical detection of multidrug resistance (MDR1)
gene products and their mRNA within brain tumor cells has already been
described by Fojo et al. 1987. 63 specimens of astrocytomas and glioblastomas
were analysed in the present study (Grading type 1 to 4) by means of the
monoclonal antibody JSB1. The endothelial cells were positive only in
astrocytic tumors with a grading of 1. Increasing tumor grading resulted in
more positive immunological reactions in tumor cells. The most impressive
reaction could be found in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (G3 and G4).
Overexpression of this P-glycoprotein, a plasma membrane component of a
relative molecular mass of 170 kDa was not only found in tumor cells of
anaplastic astrocytomas, but also in endothelial cells and some non-neoplastic
brain diseases. Positive immunological reactions in protoplasmatic astrocytes
could be demonstrated in cases of phenylketonuria (1/1), tuberculous
leptomeningitis (2/2), SSPE (3/4), X-ray necrosis (1/1) and necrotizing viral
encephalitis (1/4). According to this, it seems that astrocytes are able to
express P-glycoprotein under the influence of some special metabolic
conditions. This underlines the detoxicating function of reactive astrocytes
within the total number of cells in the CNS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A method for quantitating specific anti-viral antibodies in serum
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is established using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Quantitated antibody levels are used to determine intrathecal
specific IgG synthesis rate for the particular antibody. Measles virus was used
as a model for validating this quantitative technique: a mutated form of
measles virus is a cause of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and
there is a possibility that measles virus is related to the cause of multiple
sclerosis (MS). Matched serum and CSF samples were assayed. Concentration of
anti-measles IgG was determined and intrathecal measles-specific IgG synthesis
rate was calculated. For the SSPE samples, measles-specific IgG synthesis rate
was elevated and comprised &gt; 20% of the total intrathecal IgG synthesis
rate; these results are consistent with the literature. The ELISA method can be
performed routinely, providing a quick, simple, reproducible means of
quantitating specific antibody concentrations, with sensitivity greater than 1
nanogram per milliliter. With this method, quantitation of IgG antibodies to
any other viral antigen can be reliably and precisely determined.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Intraventricular interferon (IFN) administration has been shown to
improve the course of SSPE. However, in 2 patients treated with
intraventricular IFN-alpha-2a over a long period, we observed the appearance of
clinical and EMG signs suggestive of upper and lower motor neuron pathology.
These signs improved slightly in one patient after the discontinuation of IFN.
It is suggested that this poly-peptide may act on specific kinds of nervous
cells which selectively suffer together in various well-known neurological
diseases.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 12-year-old girl with fulminant subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) without myoclonic jerk and periodic EEG complexes is
reported. She presented with blurred vision, fell into a coma after 2 weeks and
died within 4 months. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) disclosed high intensity
lesions in the lateral geniculate bodies, when the patient initially complained
of blurred vision. Reviewing the cases of fulminant SSPE in the literature,
more than half of the patients showed blurred vision or visual agnosia as an
initial symptom. Most of those patients were female and rapidly deteriorated to
a comatose state within 2 weeks. Based on the MRI study of the present patient,
we speculate that the initial visual impairment in such patients can be
attributed to the involvement of the lateral geniculate body.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The antiviral activity of ribavirin was studied in hamsters infected
with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) virus. Ribavirn did not improve
the survival of infected hamsters when administered intraperitoneally at the
maximal nonlethal dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 10 days. However, when administered
intracranially, ribavirin improved the survival of infected hamsters in a
dose-dependent manner. The 50% effective dose was calculated to be 1.4
mg/kg/day, and the selectivity index, based on the ratio of the 50% lethally
toxic dose (31 mg/kg/day) to the 50% effective dose, was 22. When begun 12 h,
but not 36 h, postinfection, ribavirin at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day completely
prevented mortality and inhibited the replication of SSPE virus in brains of
infected hamsters. Intrathecal or intraventricular administration of ribavirin
should be explored for potential use in the treatment of patients with SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a very rare but lethal
disease caused by measles viruses (MV) persisting in the human central nervous
system (CNS) is characterized by lack of viral budding, reduced expression of
the viral envelope proteins and spread of MV genomes through the CNS despite
massive immune responses. The five major MV genes from several SSPE cases were
cloned and sequenced, the two transmembrane envelope glycoproteins
hemagglutinin (H) and fusion protein (F) were expressed and their maturation,
cellular localization and functionality analyzed. We conclude that 1) mutations
in the MV genes arise not only individually, by errors of the MV polymerase,
but also in clusters as hypermutations, presumably due to RNA
unwinding/modifying activity altering accidentally formed double-stranded RNA
regions, 2) MVs spread in SSPE brains after clonal selection, 3) the MV matrix
(M) gene is most heavily mutated and dispensable, 4) the two genes encoding
envelope transmembrane proteins give rise to functional but altered proteins
(typically F is heavily altered in its cytoplasmic domain), 5) H protein is
transported poorly to the cell surface, 6) F and H proteins maintain tightly
interdepending fusion functions, presumably to allow local cell fusion and MV
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) spread through the CNS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Evidence is presented showing that the brain cells of patients with
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) contain mutant measles (MV) genomes
having the characteristics of 5' copy-back defective interfering (DI) RNAs.
Using a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification specific for copy-back
DIs, abundant, discrete cDNAs representing different-sized MV defective RNA
species were generated from each SSPE brain. The defective genomes were cloned
in two portions. The most common of these defective species were sequenced,
confirming their MV genome origin and 5' copy-back nature. We deduced that the
minimum DI stem length of these species was 95 nucleotides, further delimiting
the prerequisite 5' regulatory region sequences specifying MV genomic
replication/encapsidation functions. This calculation assumes a precise
copy-back mechanism and complete complementarity of the panhandle structure.
Since the SSPE-derived viral genome encodes dysfunctional viral envelope
proteins, we hypothesize that SSPE brains may lack the high degree of selective
pressure encountered in tissue culture MV infections. This allows for the
coexistence of numerous replication-competent defective particles in each SSPE
brain. A role for viral defective particles as modulators of this persistent
measles virus infection of humans is proposed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Electroencephalography plays a very important role in the diagnosis
and course monitoring of epilepsy. The EEG is also able to give decisive clues
in diseases other than epilepsy. It is important to know these specific EEG
patterns which may assume a key role in the diagnosis of rare neuropediatric
diseases. Familiarity with such specific patterns will allow to select only
specific investigations for diagnostic confirmation. We report six guiding EEG
patterns and the associated disorders: 1. Re-build up phenomena for Moyamoya
syndrome. 2. High amplitude alpha-beta activity for lissencephaly type I. 3.
Positive spikes during low frequency photostimulation for late infantile
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. 4. Periodic high amplitude discharges for
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). 5. Burst suppression pattern in
non-asphyctic mature newborns for Ohtahara syndrome, non ketotic
hyperglycinemia or molybden cofactor deficiency. 6. High amplitude 3-4 HZ
activity with small spikes for Angelman syndrome.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) was
treated with an intraventricular alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) through an Ommaya
reservoir. A 17-year-old boy, who had a history of measles exposure at age 1,
showed forgetfulness, difficulties in calculation, reading and writing. Two
months later he developed generalized convulsions and myoclonic spasms. He was
admitted to the National Saigata Hospital in May 20, 1992. On admission,
anti-measles antibody titer in the CSF was 1:16 by complement-fixation method.
His EEG revealed a periodic synchronous discharge. Therefore, the diagnosis of
SSPE was confirmed. An Ommaya reservoir was implanted on July 7, 1992, and an
intraventricular administration of INF-alpha was begun after two weeks. The
dose of INF-alpha was gradually increased from 1.0 x 10(6) IU/m2 to 2.0 x 10(6)
IU/m2 twice a week. Fever, vomiting and anorexia were developed when the
INF-alpha injection was first started. When he received a total dose of 8.0 x
10(6) IU, he became bed ridden for remarkable lethargy. The lethargy was
continued for about 10 days despite the therapy was interrupted, and then he
gradually became alert. The frequency of myoclonus became more frequent and
mentality got worse, so the treatment with INF-alpha was tried again in
decreasing the dose to 1.0 x 10(6) IU/m2 twice a week. However, be became
drowsy again after he received a total of 7.5 x 10(6) IU. With intramuscular or
intravenous administrations of the high doses of INF-alpha (&gt; or = 1.0 x
10(7) IU), significant neurological abnormalities were reported to
occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

ABSTRACT:  Twenty cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) occurring
over an 18-year period in Wales are described and used as the basis for a
comparison of measles infection, vaccination rates and the incidence of SSPE in
England and Wales. Rates of measles infection were higher in Wales in all age
groups, and fewer Welsh children were vaccinated, which maintained a high risk
of SSPE per case of measles. Following vaccination, there was a more pronounced
change in the age distribution of measles infection in Wales than in England,
and it is proposed that one contribution to the high frequency of SSPE in the
1980s was the reservoir of measles in unvaccinated 2-4-year-olds, acting as a
source of infection for children aged &lt; 2 years, in whom the risk of SSPE
following measles is known to be higher than in other groups.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) cores extracted from virions of wild-type
(Edmonston strain) measles virus (MV) or obtained from MV-infected cells (cRNP)
were shown to be capable of transcribing RNA in vitro but at relatively low
efficiency. The tightly bound matrix (M) protein could be effectively removed
from virion RNP (vRNP) and from cRNP by exposure to buffers of high ionic
strength (0.5 to 1.0 M KCl) but only at pH 8.0 or higher. The vRNP and cRNP
cores complexed with M protein exhibited markedly reduced transcriptional
activity at increasing concentrations, whereas vRNP and cRNP cores free of M
protein exhibited linear and substantially higher transcriptional activity;
these data suggest that M protein is the endogenous inhibitor of MV RNP
transcription. M-gene cDNA clones derived from three strains of wild-type (wt)
MV and 10 clones from mRNAs isolated from the brain tissue of patients who had
died from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and from measles inclusion
body encephalitis (MIBE) were recloned in the pTM-1 expression vector driven by
the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase expressed by a coinfecting vaccinia virus
recombinant. All 10 mutant SSPE and MIBE clones expressed in vitro and in vivo
M proteins that reacted with monospecific anti-M polyclonal antibody and
migrated on polyacrylamide gels to positions identical to or only slightly
different from those of the M proteins expressed by wt MV clones. When
reconstituted with cRNP cores, the three expressed wt M proteins and 6 of the
10 mutant-expressed M proteins showed equivalent capacity to down-regulate MV
transcription. Three of the M proteins from SSPE clones and one from the MIBE
clone showed little or no capacity to down-regulate transcription when
reconstituted with cRNP cores. The only plausible explanations for loss of
transcription inhibition activity by the four SSPE/MIBE M proteins were
exceedingly high degrees of hypermutations leading to U--&gt;C transitions and
cloning-corrected mutations in the initiator codon (ATG--&gt;ACG) of the four M
genes. However, only the hypermutated M protein expressed by the MIBE cDNA
clone exhibited virtually no capacity to bind cRNP cores in a reconstitution
assay. These experiments provide some preliminary data to support the
hypothesis that MV encephalitis may result from certain selective mutations in
the M gene.<p>
