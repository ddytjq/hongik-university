 We were going to call this tutorial &quot;Reverse Phase
      HPLC for Proteomics&quot; but we
      decided to exercise some restraint.&nbsp; We decided to write this tutorial because reverse phase chromatography is the
      most common form of chromatography used in LC/MS applications.&nbsp; This tutorial is basically targeted
      to students and those that are new to reverse phase chromatography, HPLC, and
      LC/MS.&nbsp;
      The tutorial addresses RP HPLC of peptides and proteins but the
      principles described can be applied toward the chromatography of any compound.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p><b><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></b></p>
      <p>The message of this tutorial is that reverse phase HPLC is
      simple.&nbsp; Compounds stick to reverse
      phase HPLC columns in high aqueous mobile phase and are eluted from RP
      HPLC columns with&nbsp; high organic mobile phase.&nbsp; In RP HPLC
      compounds are separated based on their hydrophobic character.&nbsp; Peptides can be separated by running a linear gradient of the organic
      solvent.&nbsp; I often tell my fellow researchers to run the 60/60
      gradient when chromatographing an unknown.&nbsp; The 60/60 gradient means
      that the gradient starts at near 100% aqueous and ramps to 60% organic
      solvent in 60 minutes.&nbsp; The majority of peptides (10 to 30 amino acid
      residues in length) will elute by the
      time the gradient reaches 30% organic.&nbsp; To learn some of the simple
      principles of RP HPLC please read on.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In most cases the HPLC you intend to use must be able to pump and mix two solvents.&nbsp; This can be accomplished with one pump and a
      proportioning valve or by using two separate pumps.&nbsp; Generally the pumping
      configuration is an aspect of the instrumentation that is transparent to
      the user.&nbsp; Reverse phase chromatography can also be performed in a purely
      isocratic mode where the solvent conditions are held constant, this form
      of reverse phase chromatography can be carried out with a single pump.&nbsp;
      Isocratic methods are used most often in a QC environment in which a single analyte has been extensively characterized
      and the compound is being run to confirm it's identity and to look
      for closely related degradation products.&nbsp; If

          <li>Since columns are tubular, column
            dimensions usually take the following format, internal diameter X
            length (4.6mm X 250mm).&nbsp; As a mass spectroscopist you will
            encounter columns ranging in internal diameter from 0.050 to 4.6 mm
            or even larger if you are performing large scale preparative
            chromatography.&nbsp; For mass spectrometry a short reverse phase column will work nearly as well as a
            longer column and this is an important fact because shorter columns are generally
            cheaper and generate less back pressure.&nbsp; Why is less back
            pressure important?&nbsp; If a column runs at low pressure it allows
            the user more flexibility to adjust the flow rate.&nbsp; Sometimes
            shorter columns are used to do fast chromatography at higher than
            normal flow rates.&nbsp; In
            terms of length we
            routinely run 100 mm columns, however 50 mm or 30 mm columns may be
            adequate
            for many LC/MS separation needs.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The most common columns are packed with silica particles.&nbsp; The beads or particles are generally characterized by particle
            and pore size.&nbsp; Particle sizes generally&nbsp;range between 3 and 50 microns, with 5 µm particles being the most
            popular for peptides.&nbsp; Larger particles will generate less system pressure
            and smaller particles will generate more pressure. The smaller
            particles generally give higher separation efficiencies.&nbsp; The
            particle pore size is measured in angstroms and generally range between 100-1000
            angstroms.&nbsp; 300 angstroms is the most popular pore size for
            proteins and peptides and&nbsp; 100 angstroms is the most common for
            small molecules.&nbsp; Silica is the most common particle
            material.&nbsp; Since silica dissolves at high pH it is not recommended
            to use solvents that exceed pH 7.&nbsp; However, recently some manufactures
            have introduced silica based technology that is more resistant to
            high pH, it is important to take note of the manufactures suggested
            use recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition the combination of high
            temperature and extremes of pH can be especially damaging to silica.<br>

          </li>
          <li>&nbsp;The stationary phase is generally made up of&nbsp; hydrophobic alkyl chains ( -CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
            ) that interact with the analyte.&nbsp; There are three common chain
            lengths, C4, C8, and C18.&nbsp; C4 is generally used for proteins and C18
            is generally used to capture peptides or small molecules.&nbsp; The
            idea here is that the larger protein molecule will likely have more hydrophobic
            moieties to interact with the column and thus a shorter chain length
            is more appropriate.&nbsp; Peptides are smaller and need the more
            hydrophobic longer chain lengths to be captured, so C8 and C18 are
            used for peptides or small molecules.&nbsp; Here is an interesting
            note: Observations have been made that C8 columns are actually
            better for capturing smaller hydrophilic peptides, the theory here
            is that the longer C18 chains lay down during the early aqueous
            period of the gradient and the more hydrophilic peptides are not
            captured.&nbsp; We use C8 routinely for all peptide work and this
            particular alkyl chain length works equally well if not better than
            C18 for all peptides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

      <p>The reverse phase solvents are by convention installed on the HPLC channels
      <b>
      A</b> and <b>B</b>.&nbsp; The <b>A</b> solvent by convention is the aqueous solvent
      (water) and the <b>B</b> solvent by convention is the organic solvent (acetonitrile,
      methanol, propanol).&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It is important to follow this convention since the terms <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are
      commonly used to refer to the aqueous and organic solvents respectively.&nbsp; The
      <b> A</b>
      solvent is generally HPLC grade water with 0.1% acid.&nbsp; The <b> B</b> solvent
      is generally an HPLC grade organic solvent such as acetonitrile or
      methanol with 0.1% acid.&nbsp; The acid is used to the improve the
      chromatographic peak shape and to provide a source of protons in reverse phase
      LC/MS.&nbsp; The acids most commonly used are formic acid, triflouroacetic acid,
      and acetic acid.&nbsp; A
      0.1% v/v solution is made by adding 1ml of acid per liter of solvent.&nbsp; Triflouroacetic acid has
      been reported to suppress MS ionization and often mass spectroscopists&nbsp;
      lower the percentage of TFA to 0.05 or even 0.02% without significant loss in
      chromatographic efficiency.&nbsp; Some MS people add a small percentage of
      heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA, <a href="http://www.michrom.com/from_mbr/abrf98_final.pdf">pdf</a>
      from <a href="http://www.michrom.com">Michrom</a>) to acetic acid solvents or low TFA containing
      solvents to help improve peak shape.&nbsp; Since modern mass spectrometers
      are very sensitive it is important not to use plastic pipette tips when
      adding acid to the mobile phase, always use glass.&nbsp; In our work we use acetonitrile as our
      organic solvent.&nbsp;
      We have heard that the best electrospray solvent is 30% methanol, 35 mM
      acetic acid.&nbsp; We commonly use this solvent system for ESI MS
      infusion, but have found that acetic acid is an inferior acid for
      chromatographic peak shape.&nbsp; Our preferred HPLC grade water, acetonitrile
      and methanol is purchased from <a href="http://www.bandj.com/Home.html"> Burdick and Jackson</a>.&nbsp; Our preferred
      <a href="http://www.piercenet.com/Products/ViewFam.cfm?fam=02040623">TFA</a>

      <p>When chromatographing an unknown we normally use the following
      simple gradient to learn about the hydrophobic character of the
      unknown compound.&nbsp; The % <b>A</b> in the gradient described below in
      implied.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">We call this the 60/60 gradient, because we run
    from near 0% B to 60% B in 60
    minutes.&nbsp; Through experience we have noted that 90% of all peptides will elute from a C18 reverse phase
    column by 30% acetonitrile.&nbsp; There may be a few really hydrophobic
    peptides that elute later that is why we take the gradient to 60% B.&nbsp;
    You may even want to run this gradient to 80% at least once to see if you
    are getting everything off of the column.&nbsp; You may ask why don't we start the
    gradient at 0% B?&nbsp; As we talked about before, in 0% organic and in high aqueous, the very
    hydrophobic, long C18 alkyl chains in an effort to get away
    from the high aqueous environment mat down on the particle.&nbsp; When these alkyl chains
    mat down they are inefficient at capturing
    the analyte so chromatographers in the know start the gradient with some
    small % of organic, 2-5%.</p>

    <p align="left"><b><u><a name="Flow Rate">Flow Rate</a></u></b></p>
    <p align="left">It is important to use the correct flow rate for your HPLC
    column.&nbsp; Below is a table with standard flow rates for easy
    reference.&nbsp; If you are running a column with a different diameter than
    those shown in the table please review the <a href="http://www.ionsource.com/Card/linvelocity/linvol.htm">maintaining
    linear velocity</a> page to learn how to calculate the appropriate flow rate

    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="inj.jpg" width="22" height="39">The
    sample is normally reconstituted in the <b> A</b> solvent to maximize binding to the
    column.&nbsp;
    The sample should not be dissolved in an organic solvent or it may not stick
    to the stationary phase.&nbsp; The sample should not be dissolved in
    detergent containing solutions.&nbsp; Some detergents may bind
    to reverse phase columns and modify them irreversibly.&nbsp; In addition
    detergents preferentially ionize in electrospray mass spectrometry and can
    obscure the detection or suppress the ionization of the analyte.</p>

    <p align="left"><b><u><a name="Optimizing the Separation">Optimizing the Separation</a></u></b></p>

    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="rphplc3.gif" width="239" height="155"><br>
    Once you have a separation you may want to optimize it.&nbsp; You may wish
    to shallow out the
    gradient to improve the separation, or you may wish to shorten the run time.&nbsp;
    Taking the illustration above one can see that all of the peptides are out
    by 40 minutes.&nbsp; This does not mean that we can change this 80 min run into
    a 40 min run, but there is room for improvement.&nbsp; The first step in the
    optimization is to determine the %B at which the last peak elutes.&nbsp; If you look at the blue gradient
    line you might guess that the last peak elutes near 40%B but this would be incorrect.&nbsp;
    All HPLC systems have a gradient delay.&nbsp; The gradient delay is the time
    between when the software tells the pumps to start pumping at a certain
    mobile phase composition and the time it takes for that solvent composition
    to reach the column and have an effect.&nbsp; A good guess for a gradient
    delay is 10 minutes.&nbsp; This would mean that our guess for the final
    mobile phase composition for the 40 min peak would be approximately
    30%B.&nbsp; To observe the gradient delay time look at the illustration
    above and observe that the baseline returns to the starting conditions at 70
    minutes and not at 60.1 minutes when our pumps have gone back to 2% B.&nbsp; One must take care to avoid having the
    last peak elute on the &quot;equilibration cliff&quot;, (at 70 min. in this
    example).&nbsp; This can be avoided by ending the gradient at a %<b>B</b>
    that is slightly higher than that required by the last component.</p>

    <p align="left">Based on the separation shown at the top of this section one
    could rewrite the gradient to look like this:</p>

    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="rphplc6.gif" width="140" height="125"><br>
    This would make the gradient shallower and possibly give a better peak separation.&nbsp; To shorten the run time one could rewrite the gradient to look like this:</p>

    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="rphplc7.gif" width="140" height="125"><br>
    This last change would cut 30 min. from the analysis time.&nbsp; Shorter
    analysis times are always better for work efficiency.&nbsp; With every
    minute you can cut from the HPLC method without sacrificing your
    chromatographic goals you will be rewarded with better work efficiency. With
    this change the last peak
    would most likely still elute at 40 minutes and the peptide separation would
    essentially remain the same as in the initial 60/60 analysis.</p>

    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

    <img border="0" src="rphplc9.gif" width="240" height="125"></p>

    <p align="left">The column must be equilibrated, re-equilibrated to the
    initial high aqueous solvent composition before another analysis can be
    performed.&nbsp; Normally this re-equilibration is stuck onto the end of the
    gradient.&nbsp; How much equilibration time is enough?&nbsp; As a rule of
    thumb we give 20 minutes.&nbsp; In reality it depends on the column length,
    flow rate and the hydrophobicity of your peptides.&nbsp; Some chromatographers use
    10 minutes as their standard equilibration time.&nbsp; You should determine
    this parameter experimentally, the criteria will be, does my
    analyte really stick to the column and chromatograph appropriately and
    reproducibly with subsequent analyses.&nbsp;If you choose to do this part of the method development you will undoubtedly
    be rewarded with improved chromatography and better cycle time.</p>

    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left"><b><a name="Should I Control Column Temperature?">Should I
    Control Column Temperature?</a></b></p>

    <p align="left">Yes.&nbsp; Scientists are control freaks.&nbsp; If you can
    control a variable, control it!&nbsp; Actually if you are performing automated
    analyses over a long period of time peak retention times can drift with
    changing ambient temperature.&nbsp; It is common for many companies and
    institutions shut down the air conditioning at night to save money, which
    could result in shifting peak retention times due to dramatic changes in
    ambient temperature.&nbsp;
    Many HPLCs provide the option to control column compartment
    temperature.&nbsp; If your HPLC does not have this capability a heated
    column jacket can be purchased from many suppliers.&nbsp; The most common
    running temperature is <b>40°C</b>, this places the column compartment well
    above even the most extreme ambient temperature fluctuations.&nbsp; In
    addition to maintaining constant temperature, temperature can be used to
    influence the chromatographic separation.&nbsp; No chromatographic study is
    complete without a temperature study.&nbsp; In our experience higher
    temperature is better, peaks will be sharper and elute earlier. It is not
    too uncommon to perform chromatography at 60°C and some daredevils even go
    to 80°C.&nbsp; Remember though that higher temperature will lead to a
    shorter column lifetime and some columns may not be able to tolerate
    60°C.&nbsp; Consult the manufactures recommendations when experimenting
    with high temperature. After your runs are complete for the day it is
    advised that you turn off your column heater since high temperature leads to
    stationary phase deterioration.</p>

    <p align="left"><b><a name="Preparing for the First Run of the Day">Preparing
    for the First Run of the Day</a></b></p>

    <p align="left">One observation is that if you start up a reverse phase
    analysis from a dead stop with a column that has perhaps been sitting in
    high aqueous conditions for up to 10 hours the analysis will give
    irreproducible results.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom has it, you want to first
    flush the column with the highest % organic of your method for at least 3
    column volumes and then bring it back to the equilibrating condition.&nbsp;
    This practice&nbsp; may have the advantage of getting you to standard
    equilibration conditions faster and it will also clean your column. &nbsp; A better alternative is to make
    the first run a blank run (or &quot;preparation run&quot;) and then the next run can be your real analysis.&nbsp; We prefer the second option
    because it should get you to the standard starting conditions more
    accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, often,&nbsp; if we are in a hurry and the
    first option is quicker, well.....</p>

    <p align="left">We store our columns in 50/50 methanol/water without any
    acid.&nbsp; If you are using a salt, unlikely in LC/MS, wash your entire
    system, solvent bottles, HPLC, solvent lines, and column, into a non-salt
    containing solvent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Salt may precipitate out and plug your HPLC
    or column or may cause corrosion.&nbsp; Usually we flush with pure water
    first then leave the system in 50/50 methanol: water.&nbsp; Some salts may
    precipitate out in high organic so an initial water wash is advised.&nbsp;
    The 50/50 methanol:water solution helps to stop bacterial growth which can muck
    up your system.&nbsp; Take care of your HPLC, it's the right thing to do!</p>
