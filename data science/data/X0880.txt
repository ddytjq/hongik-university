              <p><small><small>This new four video set on advanced basketball
              skills comes to us from Coaches Don Meyer and Jerry Krause.&nbsp;
              Don Meyer is one of only 17 coaches to amass 700 wins at the
              college level and is </small> </small><small><small>renown</small></small><small><small>
              around the country as one of the
              games best teachers.&nbsp; In fact some call him the coach's
              coach.&nbsp; Jerry Krause, Head of the NABC Research Committee, a former Head Coach at Eastern
              Washington, and now part of the coaching staff at Gonzaga, is one
              of the game's best educational minds.&nbsp; Together they have
              published over 30 books and video making them one of coaching's
              most recognized names.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new 4-video set was
              created as the advanced part of an 18 video set covering all
              basketball skills.&nbsp;&nbsp; Titled Advanced Basketball Skills
              this set is meant to demonstrate that some basketball fundamentals
              can be taught to youth clear up to the NBA level with
              success.&nbsp; While this particular 4-video series is probably
              more </small></small><small><small>apropos</small></small><small><small>
              for the high school, college and pro coach the drills and
              instructional keys can be used at the youth level as well.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small><img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/catch_your_players.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">This first video in the series is titled
              Basketball &amp; Body Control.&nbsp; It is the longest of the four
              videos and covers are variety of skills including stance,
              footwork, moving with and without the ball, moving with the
              dribble, getting open and using on and off ball screens.&nbsp; <i>Basketball and Body Control</i> narrows your attention down to the
              critical details body balance and footwork in each of these skill
              areas.&nbsp; It is rich in teaching ideas, and useful coaching
              terminology designed to simplify how you teach and what to coach
              in these basic fundamental areas.</small></small></p>
              <h3><small><small><font color="#FF8000">Learning to Teach A Skill
              the Correct Way</font></small></small></h3>
              <p><small><small>This video, and each of the others in the series
              begins with a 7 minute introduction by Don Meyer on how to improve
              your teaching methods to become a better coach.&nbsp; In this
              section he teaches that a coach's job is to increase the rate of
              the learner, and to correct bad habits that inhibit a player's
              development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also covers the steps for how to
              correctly teach a skill including how to properly introduce it,
              using key terminology to simplify the learning process, the
              demonstration, the importance of immediate and proper practice,
              and how to correct skills.&nbsp; For coaches who haven't had much
              experience in teaching methodology this is a valuable sequence and
              accurately shows the proper way to teaching basketball skills.&nbsp;
              Coach Meyer is enjoyable to watch and he is full of many good
              ideas, coaching keys, and quotes.&nbsp; One we liked was
              &quot;catch your players in the act of doing something
              good.&quot;&nbsp; As coaches we often fall into the trap of only
              focusing on the mistakes and creating a &quot;negative&quot;
              learning environment.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>Normally a video of this length might bog down
              and lose some effectiveness along the way, but that isn't the case
              with this introductory volume in the <i>Advanced Basketball Skills</i>
              series by Coach Meyer and Coach Krause.&nbsp; Following the
              important message on how
              to teach skills you are brought quickly into a fundamental theme of this
              video and which is carried through each of the videos in the whole
              series.&nbsp; That is, how to play quick, with balance, and
              proper footwork.&nbsp; Coach Meyer states &quot;all fundamentals
              are based on footwork and body control&quot; which is so obviously
              true, and so unfortunately neglected by many coaching in their
              teaching stations.</small></small></p>
              <h3><font size="1" color="#FF8000">It All Starts with Proper
              Drills</font></h3>
              <p><small><small>To meet their objective Coaches Meyer and Krause
              move directly into a section they call Drills for Body Control and
              Balance.&nbsp; Using a series of line drills (to increase the
              amount of repetitions a larger number of players can execute in a
              brief time period) you are rapidly introduced to a number of
              footwork drills to teach stance, starts, stops, turns (pivots),
              jumps, and cuts.&nbsp; We were particular impressed with the
              drills for making front, back, and back door cuts which often find
              themselves bogged down in a one or two player drill when in fact
              they can be taught &quot;en masse.&quot;</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small><img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/make_a_quick_stop.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">From quick starts, stops, and cuts the teaching
              drills on to Passing and Balance drills also demonstrated in large
              numbers with efficiency.&nbsp; These included the push/flip pass,
              two-handed chest pass, overhead pass, baseball (hand) pass, and
              ball fake and baseball pass.&nbsp; The progression continues with
              drills for dribble penetration including the direct drive (what
              many coaches call the jab and go) and the crossover dribble.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>The dribble drills demonstrated get progressively
              more advanced and Coach Meyer and Krause reveal how you can create
              any variety of combinations of skills including starts, turns,
              dribbles and passes.&nbsp; This section is an excellent teaching
              progression for coaching who feel they are weak in this area and
              looking for more structure to teaching basic fundamentals both at
              the start of a season and as refreshers to deteriorating skills as
              the season progresses.&nbsp; In fact the point is made that many
              successful NBA teams do more of these drills than most coaches at
              lower levels realize, a point well made.&nbsp; While there is
              nothing startling about the dribble drills in terms of the type
              taught, we in particular liked the drills they used and how they
              were practiced because they get a large number of learners
              involved at one time.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>There is a brief offering of a Transition Defense
              drill which tokenly addresses this subject and might have been
              better either expanded upon or dropped from the video but the
              drill itself is useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></small></p>
              <h3><font size="1" color="#FF8000">Changing Speed and Directions</font></h3>
              <p><small><small>Don Meyer's son, Jerry, himself an Assistant
              Coach at Vanderbilt University is brought in at this point in the
              video and does a commendable job teaching footwork combination
              drills which include teaching players to change speeds, direction
              and together in combination with quick <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/get_close_to_the.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">stops,
              starts and turns (pivots).&nbsp; There are several excellent
              teaching point in this section by both Don and Jerry Meyer
              including their emphasis on performing all your skills with
              &quot;economy of motion&quot;.&nbsp; For example Don Meyer
              explains the difference between what they call the &quot;quick
              stop&quot; and what most coaches teach the &quot;jump
              stop&quot;.&nbsp; He says &quot;we want a quick stop not a jumping
              stop on offense because parachuting in gives the defense added
              time to close-out&quot; to the ball. An effective visual tool and
              teaching key for teaching economy of motion.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>Basketball &amp; Body Control closes with
              sections on V and L cuts filled with excellent drill sequences
              especially when working in 3 man groups or 3 on O with 1 defender,
              to make use of as many baskets as possible in your gym.&nbsp; More
              &quot;Meyerism's&quot; fill this section including &quot;get close
              to the defender's body to get yourself open, and &quot;there's a
              difference between running drills and executing
              skills.&quot;&nbsp; The video closes with 2 on 0, and 3 on 0
              passing and cutting drills, and 2 on 2 and 3 on 3 on and off ball
              screening situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></small></p>
