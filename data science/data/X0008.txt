<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 10: </STRONG>In the wake of <STRONG>Yao Ming</STRONG> hysteria&nbsp;-- the NBA, obviously, made the 7-5 Chinese center the top pick in last month's draft&nbsp;-- adidas brought <STRONG>Yi Jianlian</STRONG> over to ABCD Camp in North Jersey. The 6-11 center scored eight points in both of his games on Monday. He had a six-point effort as well as an 11-pointer on Tuesday. And he had six points and five boards in his game during Wednesday afternoon's session. Not great&nbsp;-- but not bad. "It's the beginning of the game getting stronger," Yi said through his translator, <STRONG>Jason Xue</STRONG>. "More people in China are getting interested in basketball." Yi's just trying to get acclimated to the American style of play. "This is always players doing things by themselves," Xue said. "In China, we play more of a team game." As for the NBA? "Maybe in two years," Yi said. "Maybe some day. But I dream about it." Also of note here in Hackensack: Ohio State commitment <STRONG>Ivan Harris</STRONG> entered Wednesday night as the camp's top scorer (20.6 points per game), <STRONG>Mustafa Shakur</STRONG> was No. 1 in both assists (4.6) and steals (2.4), and rising junior big man <STRONG>David Burgess</STRONG> was atop the rebounding chart (11.5).</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 9: </STRONG>It's all about the shoes this time of year&nbsp;-- or any time of year&nbsp;-- on the grassroots circuit. And so it was Sunday here at ABCD when adidas staffers distributed new kicks to all 200-plus campers. The primary pair&nbsp;-- the ones intended for games&nbsp;-- were the new A3s. And the verdict? "Oh my God," Philly point guard <STRONG>Mustafa Shakur</STRONG> said Tuesday afternoon. "Adidas makes some great shoes, but these ones are so heavy. It feels like you have sand in your feet." Shakur, one of the event's top performers so far, shifted to a new style&nbsp;-- the Bromium IIIs. "These are a lot lighter," he said. Most of the campers seemed to agree. The vast majority of the kids on hand ditched the A3s for Tuesday's second day of competition. "When you first opened the box, they looked good," Baton Rouge, La., forward <STRONG>Brandon Bass</STRONG> said. "But they're boots&nbsp;-- they're too heavy. The new ones are softer, and they look better, too." Not so for big <STRONG>Kendrick Perkins</STRONG>. The hyped center from Beaumont, Texas, stuck with the A3s for his game Tuesday afternoon. "I think they're real comfortable," he said. "They don't look good, but they're good big man shoes."</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 8: </STRONG>Coaches were in the stands, players were on the court and recruiting gurus were watching it all. ABCD started Monday afternoon here in Hackensack, N.J., at Fairleigh Dickinson's Rothman Center. Beaumont, Texas, center <STRONG>Kendrick Perkins</STRONG> kicked off his bid to be this year's top shoe camp hypee with 17 points and seven rebounds in his first game. <STRONG>Curtis Stinson</STRONG> was the first session's top scorer. The Bronx native&nbsp;-- a second-year prepster at Massachusetts power Winchendon&nbsp;-- had 24 points on 20 shots. Also off to a good start: Philly point <STRONG>Mustafa Shakur</STRONG>, who tallied 13 points, six assists and six steals; Ohio State-bound forward <STRONG>Ivan Harris</STRONG>, who continued his solid play of late with 19 points and five boards; Brooklyn native <STRONG>Charlie Villanueva</STRONG>, who had 16 points (on 6-for-11 shooting); and Floridian sophomore <STRONG>Darius Washington</STRONG>, who ended up with 18 points on 15 shots. Two Californian sophomores&nbsp;-- Oakland's <STRONG>Timothy Pierce</STRONG> and Irvine's <STRONG>David Burgess</STRONG>&nbsp;-- ruled the glass. Pierce, an active 6-6 wing, led all campers this afternoon with 15. Burgess hauled in 14. Scheduled for Monday night's session are primetime point guard matchups pitting Washington against Shakur as well as Coney Island phenom <STRONG>Sebastian Telfair</STRONG> against Illinois super soph <STRONG>Shaun Livingston</STRONG>.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 7:</STRONG> ABCD starts Sunday here in Hackensack, N.J., but it's not too early to look ahead to the adidas Three Stripes Classic July 12-14 in Hempstead, N.Y., on the campus of Hofstra University. Super sophomore <STRONG>Shaun Livingston</STRONG> and Ft. Sooy No Limit, Class of 2003 NBA candidate NBA candidate <STRONG>Jackie Butler</STRONG> and Southeast Pump 'N' Run and <STRONG>Sebastian Telfair</STRONG> and the Juice All-Stars are a few of the tournament's main draws. Also scheduled to be on the slate are adidas stalwarts Tim Thomas Playaz (Gold and Red) and D.C.'s Assault as well as the Long Island Panthers and the New York Ravens. But <STRONG>Luol Deng</STRONG> will also be in the house. The Blairstown, N.J., superstar hardly plays any AAU ball&nbsp;-- but he's going to be on Long Island with coach <STRONG>Rich Leary</STRONG>'s Jersey Demons. Ditto for <STRONG>Lamarcus Aldridge</STRONG> and <STRONG>Mitch Malone</STRONG>'s Texas Bluechips. The 6-10 big man has been getting tons of hype this spring&nbsp;-- but few recruiting analysts outside of Texas have actually seen him. Before Hofstra, though, there's ABCD, of course, and the adidas All-American starts Sunday at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Teams practice from 7 to 10 p.m. Games start Monday morning&nbsp;-- the day Division I coaches arrive.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 6: </STRONG>Nike All-America Camp starts Saturday in Indianapolis. Some 180 of the nation's top schoolboy basketball prospects are expected to attend. "This camp embraces the fundamentals of superior teaching while matching the top high school players in the country against each other," Nike Senior Director of Basketball Development <STRONG>Lynn Merritt</STRONG> said. "With the classroom components we provide, the camp experience is a unique blend of learning both on and off the court for these young men." Some of this year's top attractions in Indy: <STRONG>Ndi Ebi</STRONG>, the heralded forward from Houston; <STRONG>Luol Deng</STRONG>, the Sudan native who plays the wing for Blair Academy in Blairstown, N.J.; <STRONG>Shannon Brown</STRONG>, America's top shooting guard in the Class of 2003, from Maywood, Ill.; <STRONG>Tack Minor</STRONG>, a go-go point guard from Houston; <STRONG>Brandon Cotton</STRONG>, a combo guard from Detroit; and <STRONG>Vakeaton Wafer</STRONG>, a winger from Lisbon, La. Past attendees include NBA players <STRONG>Jason Kidd</STRONG>, <STRONG>Ray Allen</STRONG>, <STRONG>Kevin Garnett</STRONG>, <STRONG>Alonzo Mourning</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tyson Chandler</STRONG>. Saturday and Sunday schedules feature little but the camp's two-a-day "Leadership and College Preparedness Training." Play is slated to start Monday morning. That's when Division I college coaches can start watching the action&nbsp;-- in Indy as well as all over America.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 5: </STRONG>Detroit guard <STRONG>Brandon Jenkins</STRONG> didn't even wait for ABCD to make his college decision. The 6-4 combo from Southeastern High School&nbsp;-- one of the key cogs for <STRONG>Chris Grier</STRONG>'s Michigan Hurricanes&nbsp;-- committed to Louisville on Thursday. He picked coach <STRONG>Rick Pitino</STRONG>'s Cardinals over Pittsburgh and Missouri. U of L recruiting ace <STRONG>Mick Cronin</STRONG> made Jenkins a priority early on this past winter. Pitino made a school visit in the spring. "I think he wanted to go to camp and just relax and have fun and not feel like he needs to impress Coach Pitino or anybody else," Grier said. "Now he can just play." Jenkins uses his size and athleticism to create his own shot, play stingy defense and help out on the glass from his point slot&nbsp;-- and he can be a legitimate point guard. He'll be with the 'Canes later this month at the Big Time tournament in Las Vegas and the Pumps' event in Los Angeles. Jenkins is one of seven of Grier's kids who'll be at ABCD. The others are big-time perimeter player <STRONG>Olu Famutimi</STRONG>, Pitt pledge <STRONG>Walter Waters</STRONG>, scrappy point <STRONG>DeWayne Green</STRONG>, combo guard <STRONG>Byron Davis</STRONG> and rising junior points <STRONG>Drew Neitzel</STRONG> and <STRONG>Enrico Harris</STRONG>.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 4: </STRONG>Michigan signee <STRONG>Daniel Horton</STRONG> was added to the United States Global Games roster earlier this week. The Cedar Hill, Texas, McDonald's All-American is set to join fellow college freshmen-to-be <STRONG>DeAngelo Alexander</STRONG> (headed to Oklahoma), <STRONG>Chris Bosh</STRONG> (Georgia Tech), <STRONG>Chudi Chinweze</STRONG> (TCU), <STRONG>Jarmon Collins</STRONG> (West Virginia), <STRONG>Ike Diogu</STRONG> (Arizona State), <STRONG>Jarrett Jack</STRONG> (Tech), <STRONG>Jimmy McKinney</STRONG> (Missouri), <STRONG>Arim Solares</STRONG> (Central Connecticut State), <STRONG>Theodis Tarver</STRONG> (Tech), <STRONG>Eric Williams</STRONG> (Wake Forest), <STRONG>Kyle Wilson</STRONG> (Illinois), <STRONG>Antoine Wright</STRONG> (Indiana) and <STRONG>Kevin Young</STRONG> (Missouri). <STRONG>Bryan Hopkins</STRONG>, the SMU-bound point from Dallas, is on the roster but injured. The Global Games, in their third year, are scheduled for July 4-7 and 9 in SMU's Moody Coliseum and Dallas' Reunion Arena. They feature under-22 national teams from Mexico, Yugloslavia, Croatia, Puerto Rico, Germany, Ukraine and one from the continent of Africa as well. Horton and the Americans open play Friday night against Mexico at Moody. "We are thrilled to have Daniel back with us again this year," Global Games boss <STRONG>Michael Sorrell</STRONG> said. "Daniel, along with Chris and Bracey, represent three of the greatest high school players ever produced in this area, and it'll be exciting to watch them compete against some of the best players in the world."</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 3:</STRONG> One of the more hyped Nike-bound campers made a commitment Wednesday morning&nbsp;-- and it wasn't to a college. <B>Derrick Caracter</B>, the rising freshman phenom from Scotch Plains, N.J., told coach <B>Kevin Boyle</B> that he wanted to join the powerful Celtics of St. Patrick High in Elizabeth. "When he looked at the academics, the basketball and the discipline," Boyle said, "Derrick decided St. Pat's was where he needed to be." The 6-9, 240-pound Caracter turned 14 in May. "But he plays the game like he's 30," Riverside Church 16-and-under coach <B>Paul Suber</B> said. "He can pass from the box. He finds the opposite shooter. You don't see most college guys do that." Caracter is scheduled to spend the summer camping at Nike this week in Indianapolis, traveling the Swoosh circuit with Riverside and working out at home with Church alum <B>Elton Brand</B>. He can already face the basket and make soft 12- to 15-footers. And he should team with current St. Pat's stars <B>Mike Nardi</B> and <B>Grant Billmeier</B> to give Boyle one of the schoolboy squads in the East&nbsp;-- again.&nbsp;... Also on the Wednesday morning news front: <B>Marcus White</B>, the power forward from Chicago, committed to <B>Jim Calhoun</B>'s UConn Huskies.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>July 2: </STRONG>Eight high school teams qualified over the last two weekends for the And1 High School National Championship. St. Patrick, coach <STRONG>Kevin Boyle</STRONG>'s Elizabeth, N.J., juggernaut, made it out of the Seton Hall site. <STRONG>Morgan Wootten</STRONG>'s DeMatha team won in Washington. Top-tier shooting guard <STRONG>Shannon Brown</STRONG> and his Maywood (Ill.) Proviso East squad emerged at Notre Dame. Putnam City, Okla., won in Kansas City. Forward <STRONG>Corey Gibbs</STRONG> and Stone Mountain (Ga.) Redan made it through in Suwanee, Ga., and Charlotte's Vance High beat out the competition at UNCC. The West yielded Los Angeles Loyola&nbsp;-- with wing&nbsp;<STRONG>Omar Wilkes</STRONG>&nbsp;-- and Seattle's Mount Tahoma High. Quarterfinals are set for July 13 at the Palestra in Philadelphia. Four more games&nbsp;-- including the 2 p.m. finals&nbsp;-- are set for the 14th. "Every region met our expectations," said the Hoop Group's <STRONG>Dennis Gregory</STRONG>, the man in charge of this first annual HSNC. "And everyone we've talked to so far is bringing their full team with them and then some of their guys are going elsewhere." Like the Nike Peach Jam, in North Augusta, S.C., or the adidas Three Stripes Classic, in Hempstead, N.Y., two major tournaments taking place right after sneaker camps end on the 11th.</P>

Outlaw gave a pledge to coach <STRONG>Rick Stansbury</STRONG> and his Mississippi State Bulldogs before heading out to Colorado Springs for the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival. "I wanted to get it out of the way," he said Sunday after helping the South Team to the event championship. "It'll help me pick up on my school work, and I wanted to stay close to home." As in four miles from his front door&nbsp;-- instead of Alabama, Louisville or UConn. Outlaw was one of the more active players at this week's talent-rich Festival. He ended up averaging 11.8 points and 7.8 rebounds in 23.5 minutes a game. His unique frame&nbsp;-- broad shoulders, long arms, pigeon toes&nbsp;-- allow him to do things his peers simply can't do. He attacks the glass. He runs the floor. He skies for rebounds and dunks. "Travis plays like he's been shot out of a cannon," national recruiting analyst <STRONG>Dave Telep</STRONG> said, "and he plays above the rim. He just needs to improve his perimeter game."</P>

"We knew right off the bat that the key was chemistry," said South assistant <STRONG>Norman Parker</STRONG>, who heads up the Georgia Stars AAU program. "Some of the boys were selfish to start with, but they began to play as a team. They learned to trust their teammates. You've got to win together." And they did. Mississippi State commitment <STRONG>Travis Outlaw</STRONG>&nbsp;-- the willowy wing from smack-dab in Starkville&nbsp;-- added 19 points, eight rebounds, two blocks, two assists and a steal in an energetic 27 minutes. <STRONG>Vakeaton Wafer</STRONG>, the pride of Lisbon, La., tallied 15 points and six boards. Tennessee-bound guard <STRONG>Dane Bradshaw</STRONG> had 12 points and made a series of critical plays down the stretch. Englewood, N.J., swingman <STRONG>Sean Banks</STRONG> led four East players in double figures. In the bronze medal game, the West outscored the North, winning 149-138. Seattle's <STRONG>Rodrick Stewart</STRONG> led all scorers with 32 points.</P>

With the possible exception of Houston forward <STRONG>Ndi Ebi</STRONG>&nbsp;-- and maybe Maywood, Ill., shooting guard <STRONG>Shannon Brown</STRONG>&nbsp;-- Harris was the most consistent performer in the three games of round-robin play during the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival here in Colorado Springs. The 6-8 rising senior combo forward from Springfield, Ohio&nbsp;-- an early Ohio State commitment&nbsp;-- averaged 20 points and 12 rebounds in Friday's double-header and then went for 31 and 10 in the North Team's win over the West Saturday morning. He hit smooth lefty jumpers and worked hard rebounding&nbsp;-- as usual&nbsp;-- and earned more than his fair share of hustle points. "Ivan Harris gets it," national recruiting analyst <STRONG>Dave Telep</STRONG> said. "It's easy to come to something like this and get lost because people don't get you the ball. But he's been able to be successful by cleaning the glass and getting it done around the basket." He averaged 12 points, nine rebounds and four blocks a game as a junior at Springfield South High School. As a sophomore, he accounted for 20 points, eight boards and 5.1 blocks a game while playing for North High School.</P>

The 7-footer from Appleton, Wis., still has the same eight schools in his list: Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina, Marquette, Tennessee, Iowa and Stanford. "I'll probably narrow it down when I get back from this," Butch said Thursday afternoon after a practice session at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival out here in Colorado Springs. The affable big guy has asthma&nbsp;-- and it's not reacting well to the thin air in the high altitude at the Olympic Training Center. He complained of shortness of breath on the first day&nbsp;-- even though the workouts were light. Asthma aside, Butch showed more of what he's shown all spring long, scoring at will with both post moves and nice perimeter touch. He averaged 21.2 points and 12.1 rebounds a game this past winter in leading Appleton West High School to a 21-3 record and a spot in the state quarterfinals. He earned all-state first team laurels in addition to the Wisconsin AP Player of the Year award. He'll camp at ABCD in early July and then hit the adidas Big Time tourney with his Fox Valley Skillz AAU club later in the month.</P>

So did <STRONG>Brian Randle</STRONG>, a 6-7 combo forward from East Peoria, Ill. Added to the East squad were <STRONG>Sean Banks</STRONG>, a high-scoring 6-7 swingman from Englewood, N.J., and Bergen Catholic; <STRONG>Grant Billmeier</STRONG>, a 6-9 center from Elizabeth, N.J., powerhouse St. Patrick; and <STRONG>Chris Paul</STRONG>, the stock-boosting Wake Forest point guard commitment from West Forsyth High in Clemmons, N.C.

The 6-10 power forward committed to Georgia but was rejected after his ACT from last June was red-flagged. He's since gotten qualifying marks on the ACT and the SAT, according to <STRONG>Matt Eagan</STRONG> of the Hartford Courant, and both scores have been validated. "I look at it as a blessing to be recruited by three of the top 10 schools in the country," Turner told the Courant. "It's kind of a shock that they still have scholarships, but it's true that it worked out well for me. I worked hard to get where I am now, and I don't want to make a quick decision. I want to make the best decision possible." Turner averaged 18 points and 12 rebounds at Maine's Bridgton Academy this season. UConn is eyeballing Israel's <STRONG>Yaniv Green</STRONG> and Chicago's <STRONG>Marcus White</STRONG>&nbsp;-- both 6-8 forwards&nbsp;-- to replace departed post player <STRONG>Johnnie Selvie</STRONG> with its final scholarship for the Class of 2002. The Huskies already have three signed: <STRONG>Rashad Anderson</STRONG>, a 6-5 shooting guard from Lakeland, Fla.; <STRONG>Denham Brown</STRONG>, a 6-5 swingman from Toronto; and Hilton <STRONG>Armstrong</STRONG>, a 6-10 big guy from Peekskill, N.Y.</P>

"It's a great honor to be selected and to have the opportunity to be a part of USA Basketball and all of the great talent from across the nation," Stimac said. "I look at it as one of the highlights of my coaching career." So does Taylor, Florida's 4A Coach of the Year this past season. "It'll be an excellent measuring tool to see what it takes to get past the dreams and get to the next level," he said.</P>

But it also means Five-Star Camp. A new batch of prospects gathered in Honesdale, Pa., to work on skills and play some games during this week's session. Five-Star's <STRONG>Stu Lash</STRONG> called Friday with an end-of-camp update. <STRONG>Terrance Roberts</STRONG>, a 6-8 power forward from Jersey City, N.J., and <STRONG>Brandon Foust</STRONG>, a 6-6 swingman from Columbus, Ohio, were co-Most Outstanding Players. <STRONG>Sean Banks</STRONG>, the offensive-minded wing from Bergen Catholic, in Oradell, N.J., led the camp in scoring. <STRONG>Mbainai Narmbaye</STRONG>, a 6-10 center from Life Center Academy, in Burlington, N.J., was the top rebounder. <STRONG>Andrew Lavender</STRONG>, the shifty 5-7 point from Columbus, Ohio, was dubbed the best playmaker. Most promising was <STRONG>David McClure</STRONG>, a 6-6 sophomore from Stamford, Conn. The best defender and the Playoff MVP, though, ended up being <STRONG>Obie Nwadike</STRONG>, another St. Anthony kid from Jersey City. <STRONG>Mike Bakersville</STRONG>, a 6-1 guard out of West Simsbury, Conn., was the Orange-White Classic MVP. Other all-stars included Jacksonville guard <STRONG>T.J. Bannister</STRONG>; Eustis, Fla., center <STRONG>Wesley Green</STRONG>; and Life Center forward <STRONG>Adolphe Coulibaly</STRONG>.

Bannister</STRONG> was terrific this weekend in helping the Tallahassee Wildcats to a spot in the Rumble in the Bronx semifinals. He drove the ball to the hole, yes, and he finished strong, yes, but he also did something many recruiting analysts don't think he can do&nbsp;-- he shot the ball really well. "Most people don't think I can shoot," the 5-10 point guard said. "I've started shooting a lot more." It was just that he didn't have to before. He had other talents on the team like <STRONG>O.J. Gilmore</STRONG> (now at Jacksonville University) in previous years at Arlington Country Day. This past season, though, Bannister had to take more offensive initiative. He ended up averaging 18 points, nine assists, four rebounds and three steals a game for coach <STRONG>Rex Morgan</STRONG>. The quick but strong lead guard played alongside fellow Floridian backcourt stars <STRONG>Darius Washington</STRONG> and <STRONG>Alex Gordon</STRONG>&nbsp;-- both rising juniors&nbsp;-- during the Rumble. All three are excellent prospects, but Bannister might've been the most consistent. As for his recruitment, Alabama has offered, and so has Auburn.

He committed to coach <B>Craig Esherick</B>'s program on Tuesday afternoon. Hibbert averaged nine points, eight rebounds and seven assists this past winter after missing the first 12 games with a broken left foot. He's out again right now, actually, having broken the same bone last week during a summer league game. He's expected to miss three to four weeks with the injury. Hibbert has been a Georgetown lean quite some time. Prep coach <B>Dwayne Bryant</B> played point for the Hoyas from 1986 to '90. "He has good range to 10 to 15 feet," Bryant said, "and his post moves are phenomenal. But the biggest thing he needs to work on is physical strength. He's got to work on his upper body and on his legs so he can get more bounce in his game." Hibbert's still very early in his development: He doesn't turn 16 until December. He's also the third high-profile Class of 2004 prospect to commit in recent weeks. Guards <B>DeMarcus Nelson</B> and <B>JamesOn Curry</B> pledged to Duke and Carolina, respectively.</P>

Caracter's been to coach <STRONG>Kevin Boyle</STRONG>'s St. Pat's summer camp for years. His uncle played against Boyle in Jersey preps back in the day. But don't count out Lawrenceville. But do know that Caracter's really good&nbsp;-- and has a chance to be really, really good. He's 6-9, 240, he's nimble on his feet, he can face the basket and make soft 12- to 15-footers&nbsp;... and he turned 14 on May 4. "But he plays the game like he's 30," Riverside Church 16-and-under coach <STRONG>Paul Suber</STRONG> said. "He can pass from the box. He finds the opposite shooter. You don't see most college guys do that." Membership has its privileges: Caracter will work out with Riverside alum <STRONG>Elton Brand</STRONG> this summer.

The rising junior helped La Follette High School to the Division I state basketball championship this past winter.

He hit a buzzer-beating game-winner to knock off rising senior star <STRONG>Brian Butch</STRONG> and Appleton West in the state quarterfinals this spring.

"He can put the ball in the hole," Nets coach <STRONG>Kerry Sargent</STRONG> said. "That's what he does best&nbsp;-- and against anybody. I see him as a high-major combo guard." Thanks to Blair's TOC performance, others do, too. Blair said late last week that he considered N.C. State an early leader over Wake Forest and College of Charleston. "It's close to home," Blair said, "and they have a good basketball team." Why was Blair so unknown? This past year&nbsp;-- his junior season at Camden (S.C.)

In the stands watching James were reps from three NBA teams&nbsp;-- in town already for the league's pre-draft camp&nbsp;-- NBA players <STRONG>Eddy Curry</STRONG>, <STRONG>Darius Miles</STRONG>, <STRONG>Quentin Richardson</STRONG>, <STRONG>Shawn Marion</STRONG> and <STRONG>Sagana Diop</STRONG> as well as prospective draft picks <STRONG>Steve Logan</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jared Jeffries</STRONG> and <STRONG>Dajuan Wagner</STRONG>, according to FoxSports.com's <STRONG>Frank Burlison</STRONG>. Doctors at Northwestern Hospital in Evanston, Ill., told the Associated Press that James would need six to eight weeks to recover and should be ready for his senior season at St. Vincent-St. Mary. That, of course, means no ABCD Camp and no surprise appearances at AAU tournaments. Sports Illustrated dubbed James "The Chosen One" in February. He appears on the cover of the August Slam along with fellow star prepster <STRONG>Sebastian Telfair</STRONG>.</P>

Both of them are working out with NBAers <STRONG>Gary Payton</STRONG> and <STRONG>Jamal Crawford</STRONG>. Payton sponsors their Seattle All-Stars summer team. Crawford is an alum of Beach. "It's been good," All-Stars coach <STRONG>Robert Lowden</STRONG> said, "just being able to show them that they're good&nbsp;-- but not as good as they think they are. Compared to Gary, they realize they're not that good at all." But they were good enough to average a combined 37.4 points per game this past winter in leading the Vikings to the 3A state championship. The twins have offers from Southern Cal, Washington, Washington State and Tennessee. UCLA, Oregon, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Florida are also showing interest. But expect them to end up somewhere in the Pac-10. "I think so," Beach coach <STRONG>Mike Bethea</STRONG> said. "Like I told them, look at all the top guards in the NBA. What conference did they play in? <STRONG>Jason Terry</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jason Kidd</STRONG>, <STRONG>Mike Bibby</STRONG>&nbsp;-- all Pac-10." But first this decision: Nike or adidas camp?

"He's already shooting around right now," Oakland Slam 'N' Jam coach <STRONG>Calvin Andrews</STRONG> said Wednesday afternoon. "He barely walks with a limp. He's definitely ahead of schedule." The 6-7 combo forward from Oakland&nbsp;-- one of America's top five rising seniors&nbsp;-- tore up his knee in mid-April while playing at the adidas Texas Superstar Classic in Houston. The original prognosis was that he'd be out for six months. Powe and his people are sticking with that. He's working out on a stationary bike and in the pool to increase his lateral movement and range of motion, according to the Slam 'N' Jam staff, and he'll stay the course and return to the court in time for his senior season at Oakland Tech. Powe led the last July's ABCD Camp in scoring at 21.3 points a game and rebounding with 9.9 per. He was good for 27 points and 14 boards an outing this past winter for coach <STRONG>Hodari McGavock</STRONG>'s Oak Tech team that lost to Los Angeles Westchester in the state championship game. Cal, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Duke, UNC, Louisville, Maryland and Texas are among the schools still keeping tabs.</P>

"It's a grueling two hours," Westbury head man <B>Greg Glenn</B> said Tuesday afternoon. "They do all kinds of things&nbsp;-- cross country, defensive slides with weights in your hands&nbsp;-- but it's primarily focused on strength and conditioning. It tests you mentally and physically. Especially in a hot gym with no AC down here." Ebi needs to be tested. The 6-10 combo forward has been one of the top performers in the country so far on the sneaker circuit. He's teamed up with power point <B>Tack Minor</B> and spectacular sophomore guard <B>Daniel Gibson</B> to make <B>Hal Pastner</B>'s Houston Hoops one of this year's elite summer teams. Texas, Arizona and Duke are his three clear-cut leaders at this point, and don't expect that to change before the fall, when he starts taking some official visits. He'll be in Colorado Springs later this month for the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival. Nike Camp comes shortly thereafter in Indianapolis.

Heralded wing <STRONG>Carmelo Anthony</STRONG>. But don't forget about the big kid from New York's North Country. "He's gotten a lot bigger and stronger," Watertown High School coach <STRONG>Paul Adams</STRONG> said Monday. "But he runs the floor well, he has great hands, and he's improved every year." Gorman was one of four true post players&nbsp;-- along with McDonald's All-Americans <STRONG>Brad Buckman</STRONG> and <STRONG>Chris Bosh</STRONG> and Class of 2003 Reno, Nev., stud <STRONG>David Padgett</STRONG>&nbsp;-- to make it to the next round of tryouts July 14-22 in Miami. "It's a great feeling," Gorman said, "because I'm a very patriotic person. Just to be able to wear that USA across my chest makes me very proud. So when they cut it down to 16 it makes you feel really special." The Syracuse signee averaged 20.6 points and 8.3 rebounds per game as a senior. He blocked a school-record 130 shots as a junior and a total of 340 over his three-year varsity career.</P>

"Israeli players have played here before," Green told <STRONG>Matt Eagan </STRONG>of the Hartford Courant, referring to former Huskies <STRONG>Nadav Henefeld</STRONG> and <STRONG>Doron Sheffer</STRONG>.

One of his best friends, <STRONG>Amit Tamir</STRONG>, currently plays at Cal, and that will be a factor in his decision-making process, Green said. Gardner, meanwhile, averaged 15 points and seven rebounds this past winter in helping perennially successful Jefferson High School to a 24-4 record. He told the Courant that he's also interested in Kansas, Michigan State, Missouri and Oregon. His cross-country trip to New England will probably end up being his only official visit in the spring. "I had some other schools in mind to visit this spring," Gardner said, "but they said it would be better if I waited until the fall." Green's qualified; Gardner's not.</P>

"He was a little bit rusty, but his conditioning was pretty good," said <STRONG>Pete Padgett</STRONG>, his father and coach at Reno High School. "He did really well." The sought-after 6-11 post prospect&nbsp;-- apparently now up to 245 pounds -- played 30 minutes a game in helping SoCal-based Pump 'N' Run to the 17-and-under championship. He left Nevada Thursday night and flew to Colorado Springs for this weekend's USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team trials. Padgett averaged 22 points and 14 rebounds this past winter before going down with his injury. He had a 30-point, 19-rebound, 10-block triple-double in December. As for Padgett's college decision, he made three of his five official visits this spring&nbsp;-- Stanford, Arizona, Kansas&nbsp;-- and he's saving his final two for the fall.

Nelson, playing for the SoCal-based Belmont Shore summer team, torched the Michigan Hurricanes for 31 points Saturday morning. He had another meeting with Coach K later in the day. "At the end of the second meeting, I spoke to Coach Krzyzewski briefly, and he seemed very happy," Belmont Shore coach <STRONG>Dinos Trigonis</STRONG> said late Sunday night after returning to the West Coast. "Whether you'd consider it a firm verbal commitment or an inclination, I can't tell." Here's what everybody can tell: Nelson is really, really good.

The gathering is set for a week from today&nbsp;-- June 4&nbsp;-- at Brooklyn College. Anyone and everyone is invited&nbsp;-- college coaches, summer coaches, high school coaches, kids, parents, recruiting gurus and so on. "I really don't know what to expect," DeCesare said Saturday night before a Ravens game at this weekend's Tournament of Champions. "But I think it's a good idea." It's a start.

Banks dropped 28 points on the New Orleans Jazz in Sunday's semifinals and ended up averaging 16.2 per game en route to MVP honors and a team title at the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions here in North Carolina's Triangle. Both Tim Thomas Playaz teams&nbsp;-- Gold and Black&nbsp;-- won 17-and-under brackets. "Sean played really well," Playaz coach <STRONG>Jimmy Salmon</STRONG> said. "He's a very good offensive player. If he gets as good defensively, he's got to be one of the top 30 players in the country. He's 6-7, and he can create his own shot&nbsp;-- and that's the bottom line." So where's he going to school? Banks said on Sunday that his top three were Maryland, Pittsburgh and N.C. State&nbsp;-- but that Rutgers, Seton Hall, St. John's, West Virginia and Texas were also still possibilities. Expect a decision somewhere in between ABCD and the end of the summer. The lanky Harlem native averaged 18.6 points and 7.1 rebounds this past winter as a junior at Bergen Catholic.</P>

The better question right now: Is he a four or a three. "I see myself as both," Isreal said. "I can post up. I can go outside. I just see myself as a basketball player." But if he wants to go beyond the Division I level, he'll have to be a wing. "That's what he's going to be," DC Team Assault coach <STRONG>Curtis Malone</STRONG> said after his squad's win over the Long Island Panthers here at the Tournament of Champions. "I think he's a four right now. But what's special about him is that he can do the things that a three can do." Not that his ballhandling, shooting and perimeter defense couldn't use some work. Isreal is coming off toe surgery, and his first game back was last week, when Assault played Baltimore Select in a game at Towson.

Famutimi was terrific against the Miami Tropics, driving to the hoop for his usual high-flying acrobatics, yes, but also hitting an array of impressive jumpers in transition and off the dribble. "I need to play more like a guard," the Toronto native said. "I'm just working on that and doing the reps." No question. <STRONG>Chris Grier</STRONG>, the Hurricanes coach who doubles as Famutimi's legal guardian in Flint, does some scouting for the Portland Trailblazers&nbsp;-- and he's been putting his pupil through regular NBA shooting guard workouts he gleaned from Denver Nuggets GM <STRONG>Kiki Vandeweghe</STRONG>. "I've worked him out as a prototype two-guard," Grier said. "That's what he projects as if he's going to make it to the NBA." Famutimi won MVP honors at April events in Houston and Detroit.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>May 20: </STRONG>St. Louis Eagles shooting guard <STRONG>Blake Ahearn</STRONG> is a mid-major shooting specialist. But he sure had a high-major performance this weekend. The 6-2 rising senior from DeSmet earned MVP honors in leading his AAU team to a surprising 17-and-under championship at its own tournament at the city's Washington University. He dropped 20-plus points in the semis and finals. The Eagles beat the Illinois Warriors in the finals. "I love our team," St. Louis boss <STRONG>Vince Estrada</STRONG> said Sunday night. "I wouldn't have predicted we could've won the 17s. But they've figured it out. It's nice to see them come together at this time of the spring." On an off weekend for rising junior post banger <STRONG>Kalen Grimes</STRONG>&nbsp;-- the leaper from Hazelwood, Mo., was held in single digits every game&nbsp;-- point guard <STRONG>Jamal Tatum</STRONG> was particularly good for the Eagles. "He might be the best on-the-ball defender in this class," Midwest guru <STRONG>Eric Bossi</STRONG> said of the 6-1 rising senior from Jefferson City, Mo. "He plays phenomenal on-the-ball defense." The Eagles' 16-and-under group won their eight-team bracket as well. Both squads are scheduled to be in action this coming weekend in Bloomington, Ind., at the Nike Memorial Day Classic.</P>

Providence and UMass have offered. Tennessee, Cincinnati, N.C. State and Temple are involved. But the 6-5 combo guard knows where he might be next year&nbsp;-- at a New England prep school. Worcester and Brewster&nbsp;-- in Worcester, Mass., and Wolfeboro, N.H., respectively&nbsp;-- are in the running for his services. He visited Worcester last week. A trip to Brewster is scheduled for the near future. "It'd get my game better," Brewington said Saturday morning. "It'd get myself more ready for college." <STRONG>Mo Vasquez</STRONG> agrees. "It'd be great for him," the Metro Boston AAU coach said. "At a public school, you have some kids who are chasing the dream, and you have some kids who are knuckleheads." Brewington is certainly one of the best prepsters who's not going to ABCD or Nike. For whatever reason&nbsp;-- Metro Boston's lack of a specific shoe affiliation?&nbsp;-- he hasn't gotten an invite. But he averaged 24 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists a game this past winter at Lynn English. Brewington and his Metro Boston troops are scheduled to be in Albany, N.Y, this weekend for the Gym Rats' Memorial Day tourney.</P>

The 6-5 shooting guard from Thayer Academy in Braintree, Mass., last weekend won competitions in the high jump, 100-meter dash, high hurdles and 4x100 relay at the state's Independent School League meet. Jones cleared 6-2 in the high jump, he said, although his all-time person best is 6-8. This weekend he's gunning for gold in the same four events in Byfield, Mass., at the New Englands. Meanwhile, on the basketball court, he's weighing scholarship offers from Maryland, Boston College, UConn, Florida and Charlotte. Illinois and Providence are no longer involved. Georgia Tech and Ohio State are trying to work their way into the picture. "But the kid could change his mind in the next three minutes," Thayer coach <STRONG>Robin Dixon</STRONG> said. "He's just going to see what happens this summer and then narrow it down to four by the end of the summer." One thing's for sure: "The guy has plenty of offensive skills from medium range to deep," national recruiting expert <STRONG>Dave Telep</STRONG> said. "He flat-out scores." Jones, a native Bostonian, averaged 22 points and 14 rebounds as a junior at Thayer.</P>

Boston College, Providence, UConn, N.C. State, Charlotte and Memphis lead an interested group of high-major suitors, WA coach <STRONG>Mo Cassara</STRONG> said Thursday afternoon here in Central Massachusetts. But Hailey still has plenty to prove. The 5-11 guard&nbsp;-- is he a point or a combo?&nbsp;-- averaged 10.2 points per game in a so-so junior year after producing gaudier numbers as a sophomore. <STRONG>Jarrett Jack</STRONG>'s presence had something to do with the statistical decline&nbsp;-- Cassara gave the ball to the Georgia-Tech bound star&nbsp;-- but Hailey also just struggled at times. Even as the Hilltoppers advanced to the New England prep championship game before losing to Carolina signee <STRONG>Rashad McCants</STRONG> and New Hampton. "Stevie is one of those guys you've just got to let play," Cassara said. "If the game's going up and down, he'll be tremendous. And he's a gym rat. He's in the gym all the time now." Hailey and fellow seniors-to-be <STRONG>Sam Kaplan</STRONG> and <STRONG>Nick Stafford</STRONG>&nbsp;-- both solid mid-major prospects&nbsp;-- are expected to lead next year's Worcester squad. Before that, though, look for Hailey at Nike summer events with <STRONG>Leo Papile</STRONG>'s<STRONG> </STRONG>BABC troops.</P>

And even after New Jersey counterpart <STRONG>Mike Nardi</STRONG> did so well. The title is still Shakur's&nbsp;-- for now. If for no other reason than his Saturday night dunk all over the noggin of D.C. swingman <STRONG>Keith Blanks</STRONG>. Seriously, though, his list shows Arizona, Virginia, Syracuse, Villanova, Seton Hall, N.C. State and Georgia Tech. "Am I missing anybody?" he asked. "I don't want to forget anyone. But it's still open. I'm planning on making an early decision." Shakur averaged 16.5 points, seven rebounds, five assists and four steals a game this past season for Friends' Central in Wynnewood. "I would like to improve on my defense," he said. "Everything, really&nbsp;-- I'm not perfect yet." But he is the best of a bunch that has lukewarm depth of talent. The elite '03 point man troops boast Nardi and Houston sparkplug <STRONG>Tack Minor</STRONG> as well. But it's no Class of 2002-esque motherlode at the position.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>May 15: Will Sheridan</STRONG> was terrific this winter during his junior season in Hockessin, Del., at the Sanford School. The 6-9 power forward averaged 20 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks per game in leading coach <STRONG>Stan Waterman</STRONG>'s team to the state championship. He was dubbed the state's player of the year. Now he's out on the adidas summer circuit with <STRONG>Jimmy Salmon</STRONG>'s high-octane Tim Thomas Playaz. And he's getting plenty of love from the college coaches. Seton Hall, Villanova, Rutgers, Michigan, Virginia, Wake Forest, Notre Dame, Charlotte and Tennessee make up his current school list&nbsp;-- at least the list he gave this past weekend in Charlottesville, Va., at the Hoop Group's Southern Invitational&nbsp;-- and all those programs have extended scholarship offers. "But it's not closed," Sheridan said. "I expect to make my decision in the late summer or early fall." The big man has been the class of Delaware for a while now. He averaged 19 points, 12 boards and six blocks as a sophomore on a 22-2 squad. "He's the state's best prospect in years," said <STRONG>Rob Matera</STRONG>, a Delaware-based scout for recruiting maven <STRONG>Bob Gibbons</STRONG>. "And the last good big man out of Delaware?

But the program as a whole more than makes up for that with its 16 squad. Coach <STRONG>Troy Johnson</STRONG>'s troops include some of the best sophomores from Chicago and around the rest of the state. <STRONG>Shaun Pruitt</STRONG>, a 6-9 post, is from West Aurora. <STRONG>Ollie Bailey</STRONG>, a 6-7 post, hails from Farragut, and 6-5 wing <STRONG>Vince Humphrey</STRONG> is from city power Fenwick. <STRONG>Gordon Watt</STRONG>, meanwhile, burst onto the national scene a couple weekends ago in Fort Wayne, Ind., at the Spiece Run 'N' Slam. The long and lanky 6-6 athlete is out of Evanston. "He's got to learn to love defense as much as he loves offense," Johnson said Monday. "He can play D. But we need to get him focused on that more. He could be a defensive stopper." The Warrior youngsters also boast heralded eighth-grader <STRONG>Willie Walker</STRONG>. The 5-11 point made all-tourney at Spiece even though he didn't start. Johnson's bunch is scheduled to play at the Windy City Shootout this coming weekend at UIC and then over in Bloomington, Ind., at the Nike Memorial Day Classic.</P>

But now it's his teammate who's sidelined. St. Pat's center <STRONG>Grant Billmeier</STRONG> fractured his right hand last week during a workout. He said this weekend that the doctor told him he'd be out for six to eight weeks. "Hopefully it'll go by sooner," he added. "I'm a pretty quick healer." Nardi, meanwhile, played his way back onto the national radar with coach <STRONG>Rich Leary</STRONG>'s Jersey Demons this weekend. He was terrific in teaming up with superstar wing <STRONG>Luol Deng</STRONG>. Flow and timing didn't seem to be a problem. "For some reason, I'm just into the game so much," Nardi said. "It's mainly been my body adapting. My groin, general aches and pains&nbsp;-- but everything's going good." No wonder. He's been matching up with former St. Pat's and Seton Hall point <STRONG>Shaheen Holloway</STRONG> in open gyms in preparing for his return.</P>

It doesn't matter what happens during Sunday's playoffs. <STRONG>Luol Deng</STRONG> is the best player here in Charlottesville, Va., at the Hoop Group's Southern Invitational. And were it not for a kid in Akron, Ohio, named <STRONG>LeBron James</STRONG>, Deng might be the best player in the country in the Class of 2003. Seriously. The 6-8 junior guard from Blairstown, N.J., has been that good this weekend. Deng scored 39 points Friday night in a Jersey Demons win over Petersburg Metro. In three games Saturday, he went for 30, 25 and 38 in three more victories. The Demons are scheduled to meet Boo Williams Sunday morning in the quarterfinals. "Luol's a basketball player," Demons coach <STRONG>Rich Leary</STRONG> said, "and he'll be a really good player for years to come." Deng gave a school list of Duke, Virginia, Wake Forest, Texas, Missouri, George Washington&nbsp;... and Fairfield. His brother&nbsp;-- former UConn player <STRONG>Ajou Deng</STRONG>&nbsp;-- is now at Fairfield. Wherever he ends up, Deng will bring an array of skills to the floor. He averaged 22 points a game for coach <STRONG>Joe Mantegna</STRONG> at Blairstown Academy en route to earning MVP honors in the talent-rich Mid-Atlantic Prep League.</P>

He might be right. The 6-foot Brooklyn point man certainly looked good Friday night in Charlottesville, Va., at the Hoop Group's Southern Invitational. Ervin, a Riverside Church kid, showed up here with the Worldwide Renegades and scored 32 points in the team's pool play win over the Waynesboro Jayhawks. He also distributed the ball well and generally looked like what many say he isn't&nbsp;-- a true point guard. "That's what people need to realize," Ervin said. "Everybody thinks I just score, but I can do all the little things, too." He averaged 30 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds a game this past winter&nbsp;-- his senior season at Robeson High&nbsp;-- en route to PSAL Player of the Year honors and a spot in the city championship game at Madison Square Garden. Also of note on the Ervin front: He now says he's going to do his post-grad year in Fitchburg, Mass., with <STRONG>Bill Barton</STRONG>'s Notre Dame Prep squad instead of in Oakdale, Conn., at St. Thomas More.</P>

But this weekend is important&nbsp;-- especially for <STRONG>Curtis Symonds</STRONG>' Fairfax squad. A good performance should put them in Gibbons' high-profile Tournament of Champions over Memorial Day weekend in North Carolina's triangle. Not that the Stars shouldn't be in the field already. They made a surprise trip to the semifinals at the <STRONG>Boo Williams</STRONG> Invitational in early April and followed that with a berth in the title game at the <STRONG>Charlie Weber</STRONG> Invitational a week later. "What else do we have to do?" Symonds asked earlier this week. "I've got quality kids that can play. I'm hoping he gives us the nod this weekend. I would love to have that opportunity."

"It's been crazy," Arkansas Wings AAU coach <STRONG>Tim Loring</STRONG> said Wednesday afternoon. "He's been handling it well, but he never thought it would happen this way."

He averaged 25 over the course of the weekend. Next up for the newest sensation on the grassroots circuit: Arkansas AAU finals, the Nike Memorial Day Classic and a college decision&nbsp;-- eventually. "He hasn't narrowed anything down," Loring said. "He's going to wait until mid-summer to get it down to 10 and then five by the end of the summer."</P>

"I don't if it could get any more intense than it already was," Fox Valley Skillz AAU coach <STRONG>Ritchie Davis</STRONG> said Tuesday afternoon. "But between yesterday and today, every single one of his final eight has called." That exclusive list includes Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina, Marquette, Tennessee, Iowa and Stanford. As well it should. Butch averaged 26.5 points, 11.2 rebounds, 5.5 blocks and 3.2 assists per game for the Skillz at Spiece. In one outing, he dropped 38 points on well-regarded Bakersfield, Calif., sophomore <STRONG>Robert Swift</STRONG>. "One thing I think separates him is his competitive nature," Davis said. "He refuses to lose. The game means so much to him. And people were awestruck at how well he shoots the basketball." Butch put up 22.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 5.5 blocks and 3.7 assists this past winter while leading his 21-3 Appleton West High School team to a spot in the state quarterfinals.</P>

Abukar was a first-team all-conference selection last year in spite of missing 13 games with a shoulder injury.

All of this came on the heels of the 17-and-under team's scrappy play last weekend at the Houston Kingwood Classic. <STRONG>Derek Raivio</STRONG>'s recruitment, meanwhile, has been on the upswing due to the point guard's eye-opening performance in the Lone Star State. According to coach <STRONG>Troy Berry</STRONG>, Stanford, Colorado, Texas and New Mexico are among the schools that have extended scholarship offers since the tourney, while many others are showing heightened interest.

"Shavlik doesn't just want to be an NBA player," his father said. "He wants to be an NBA All-Star." And a lottery pick. In whatever draft he chooses to enter.</P>

And don't think some of the Lone Star State's best current prepsters didn't take note. "T.J. came right out of here and had a great year," said <STRONG>Daniel Gibson</STRONG>, the spectacular sophomore guard at Houston's Jones High School. "On the court, he's just awesome, and he's cool to be around off the court. A lot of people look up to him." Including <STRONG>Tack Minor</STRONG>. The Houston junior is one of the nation's top prospects at his position in the prep Class of 2003. "They run and gun, and I like that," he said when asked about the Longhorns. "And T.J. attacks the rim and distributes the ball, and that's what I'm trying to work on. So I look up to T.J."</P>

"I'm going to keep trying to do both if I can," the junior said Friday night at the Kentucky HoopStar Classic. "I enjoy doing it. I've been playing both since I was little."

The first-team all-state wide receiver/quarterback/safety caught 63 balls for 15 touchdowns and 1,090 yards last fall, ran for 11 more TDs and passed for two. Louisville, Kentucky, Auburn, Tennessee, Ohio State and Penn State have offered football scholarships and the opportunity to play hoops as well. On the basketball court, "he's more suited to play the three because he's just so strong," HoopStars AAU coach <STRONG>Eddie Ford</STRONG> said.

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><STRONG>April 7: </STRONG><B>Gary Ervin</B> and <B>Quincy Douby</B> were borough rivals this winter in New York City's Public School Athletic League. But they opened the summer circuit this weekend in Hampton, Va., as teammates with Riverside Church. Both Brooklyn seniors are starting in coach <STRONG>Kenny Pretlow</STRONG>'s backcourt here at the Boo Williams Invitational&nbsp;-- and they apparently want that partnership to continue into the prep and college ranks. "We want to be recruited together," Ervin said Saturday afternoon, "and we want to play together in college. That's what we've talked about. We both want to go to the Big East. Or the ACC or the SEC. As long as we play together." Ervin, a 6-1, up-tempo point guard, goes all-out all the time. His school list at this point includes Mississippi State, Pittsburgh, Seton Hall and Rutgers. Douby, perhaps the best high school shooter this side of Duke-bound McDonald's MVP <B>J.J. Redick</B>, signed with Hofstra back in November. But expect him to prep with Ervin&nbsp;-- St. Thomas More? Notre Dame of Massachusetts? Mt. Zion?&nbsp;-- and end up somewhere other than Hempstead. "With prep school next year," New York aficionado <B>Tom Konchalski</B> said, "both guys get recruited at the Big East/ACC level."<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><STRONG>April 6: </STRONG>Hampton University's Holland Hall sounded on Friday night a bit like Fenway Park circa October 1986. "Daaaaaarryl&nbsp;... Daaaaaarryl." The fans' chants weren't for former New York Met <STRONG>Darryl Strawberry</STRONG>. They were for his son. Straw Junior&nbsp;-- a.k.a. D.J.&nbsp;-- scored 22 points for California Team Select in its 63-50 win over the Kentucky Hoop Stars. "It's like that every game," the 6-4 rising senior swingman said of the cheers and jeers. "It's like the thing to do. But I take it as a compliment." Said Cali coach <STRONG>Thaddeus McGrew</STRONG>: "He gets a lot of attention because of who he is." But also because of what he does. The prospect from Mater Dei in Santa Ana, Calif., even hit a few threes in his Boo opener. "He's improved on his offensive game," McGrew said. "He's shooting the ball a lot better." The Pac-10 has noticed. Oregon and Arizona are in hot pursuit, according to McGrew and his star, and Strawberry is very much a West Coast kid who'll almost certainly end up at a West Coast school&nbsp;-- where he'll almost certainly hear more of that familiar serenade.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><STRONG>April 5: </STRONG>One of the most-asked questions in New York at the McDonald's Game&nbsp;-- Who's the best best player here?&nbsp;-- is in need of an adjustment: Who's the second-best player here? Because No. 1 is clear: It's <STRONG>Amare Stoudemire</STRONG>. The 6-foot-10 manchild from Orlando has all but declared his preps-to-pros intentions&nbsp;-- and he might be the only McDonald's kid who should even be thinking along those lines. "He's the best combination of size and athleticism," PrepStars.com's <STRONG>Rob Harrington </STRONG>said before Thursday night's game. "Big guys are the most highly sought-after, obviously, and he's the guy who has the physical maturity." Stoudemire then made only four of his 10 shots from the field and two of his four free throws. He finished with a ho-hum 10 points and seven rebounds in 22 minutes. But don't be fooled. One play in particular screamed N-B-A: His soaring block on <STRONG>DeAngelo Collins </STRONG>near the basket&nbsp;-- after being beaten badly on the perimeter&nbsp;-- was singularly amazing. "Stoudemire has the best chance to test the waters," TheInsidersHoops.com's <STRONG>Dave Telep </STRONG>said. "Everybody else should really be a college basketball player."<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><STRONG>April 4: </STRONG>Future Maryland Terrapin <STRONG>Travis Garrison </STRONG>looked for future Indiana Hoosier <STRONG>Bracey Wright </STRONG>Monday night when the McDonald's All-Americans gathered at the Hotel Inter-Continental to watch the national championship game. "I made sure I sat right next to him," Garrison said Wednesday morning at practice. "I told him we were going to win." And the Terps did. Even after the shaky play throughout much of the contest&nbsp;-- "It looked like they were nervous or something," Travis said&nbsp;-- and even after the Hoosiers surged to tie the game in the middle of the second half. "I thought they were going to beat Maryland," Wright said. "They knocked everyone else off." No matter. Next year is a new game. Garrison is set to become Maryland's only McDonald's kid&nbsp;-- this year's team became the first since 1979 to win the title without one&nbsp;-- and Wright figures to give the Hoosiers a dose of quickness in the backcourt. "How their offense and defense are structured is really good for a guard," he explained. "They didn't have anybody who could create their own shot." Now they do.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P>
