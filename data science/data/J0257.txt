<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Organisers of Historic Rallies have a considerable
responsibility to the sport at this stage of its development.&nbsp; So
far there has been a conscious effort from the majority of those involved
to recapture the spirit and sportsmanship that is remembered as being part
and parcel of rallying in the fifties and sixties and the most successful
events are strong on atmosphere.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Historic Rallying should
be fun and whilst the element of competition is one ingredient, the social
aspect should not be overlooked.&nbsp; The taking part and the challenge
of completing the course may be sufficient for many competitors.&nbsp;
If high speed performance is perceived to be the sole criteria by which
achievement is judged and rewarded, those drivers with older and perhaps
more exotic vehicles may be discouraged from entering; this would certainly
be to the detriment of the sport.&nbsp; A wide range of cars is much more
likely to attract paying spectators to a stage rally.&nbsp; From the public
relations standpoint residents along the route of a road event are happier
to accept the spectacle of a variety of vehicles, particularly if some
of them are a little older or unusual, than a limited selection of the
quicker more familiar cars of the late sixties.&nbsp; Nevertheless those
running Historic Rallies should pay just as much attention to organisation
and public relations as those organising modern events.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Readers of this Guideline
should also look at <a href="guideline26.html">Guideline 26</a> as much
of the detail relevant to rallies for more modern cars is equally applicable
to rallies for historic cars.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Organising team</font></b></h2>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Clerk of the Course</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The responsibilities and duties of the
Clerk of the Course are well documented in the Motor Sports Yearbook (the
Blue Book) and in other Guidelines in this Manual.&nbsp; Any prospective
Clerk of the Course should acquaint themselves fully with the relevant
information.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that a
Clerk of the Course judges the right spirit for an Historic Rally and keeps
in mind that some competitors may be new to the sport so regulations and
instructions should be crystal clear.</font></b>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secretary of the Meeting</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The ro1e of the Secretary of the event
tends to be that of office manager.&nbsp; The Secretary will have the most
contact with competitors before and after the event.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary should be
involved in the signing-on' of competitors and usually becomes involved
to some extent in the results of the rally.&nbsp; They must have a working
knowledge of the penalty system and it can be helpful if they have had
some input into the design of the documentation (particularly the time
cards) as it is this paperwork that must be interpreted correctly to establish
the winner.</font></b>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chief Marshal</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The job of Chief Marshal is
becoming increasingly difficult.&nbsp; Not so long ago there was a plethora
of would be marshals ready to turn out day or night.&nbsp; Those times
are unfortunately no longer with us although marshalling is one of a number
of areas where Historic rallying has the edge on other branches of the
sport.&nbsp; You can turn to that band of enthusiasts who were members
of your motor club some years ago but have lost touch; it may be just the
excuse they need to come out of retirement and meet old friends and see
again the cars in which they used to compete.&nbsp; There is also a generation
of potential new club members out there and the appeal of the 'Historics'
is such that youngsters new to rallying are prepared to become involved.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Marshal should
have sight of the route at an early stage, perhaps three or four months
prior to the rally; he should have at least a provisional time schedule
together with the locations of the controls and, ideally, could act as
overall co-ordinator of the public relations effort with perhaps sector
marshals undertaking the 'leg work'.&nbsp; He will be, in this way, aware
of any reroutes; that may be, necessary and any special requirements such
as, 'no' boards at certain junctions, arrows, quiet boards and/or marshals
agreed during the course of the PR work.&nbsp; <i>Keep in mind that the
PR work for an Historic rally should be just as thorough as for any other</i>.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Marshal needs
to be the equipment officer and an inventory of the equipment required
on the event should be drawn up and maintained.&nbsp; It will be necessary
to move considerable quantities of tackle - control boards, stakes, bollards,
banners, cones, etc during the course of the rally and a van or trailer
is a must for any Chief Marshal.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The allocation of controls
to the troops is the task of the Chief Marshal who should establish the
experience of people at his disposal to ensure that the more knowledgeable
are allocated the potentially demanding duties.&nbsp; Convince those who
insist that they are available for only a limited period - usually the
early part of a night event that they should actually man a slightly later
control, thus enabling the stalwarts to 'doubleup' taking one control early
and one late in the event.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that as Chief
Marshal it will be expected that you will be first on the scene to set
up the Scrutineering, the start area, the special tests, etc, and that
you will be dismantling and checking in equipment when the other organisers
are already in the bar!</font></b>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other Officials</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You are required to have various other
officials on a rally.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of Scrutineers and
Timekeepers together with their grade appears in Section EE of the Blue
Book and Section FF of the Red Book respectively and it is the organiser's
responsibility to contact suitable people for the relevant duties.&nbsp;
With Historic rallying it may be desirable, if not altogether essential,
to appoint an Eligibility Scrutineer; if your event is part of a championship,
the championship organisers may have such a person for all the qualifying
rounds.&nbsp; This is particularly useful as he or she will have seen many
of the competing cars on other events.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; With the exception of Clubman
Road Rallies there must be three Stewards of an event.&nbsp; One of these
may be the MSA Steward should they decide to appoint one.&nbsp; The responsibilities
and duties of the Stewards are detailed in Section C2 and U of the Blue
Book.&nbsp; A Steward is a little like a referee at a football match -
if you know he is there it is a poor game or a poor referee.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sponsors</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The concept of sponsorship and Historic
rallying may sit a little uncomfortably with some and care must be exercised
in ensuring that the sponsors and organisers are sympathetic to the image
we should all endeavour to foster to ensure the survival of the sport.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, sponsorship decals
used to be limited to 55 sq inches in the 1960s - state restrictions clearly
in the regulations to avoid arguments.&nbsp; Many successful historic events
deliberately restrict advertising to enhance period authenticity.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sponsorship is not, in
the opinion of some Historic rally organisers, always worth having the
cost of setting up and printing extra pages in the regulations, multi coloured
covers and special rally plates together with the extra work involved in
giving the sponsor value for money, can be more than you are actually getting.&nbsp;
This can actually put up entry fees which cannot be the object of the exercise.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Help in kind may often
be of greater benefit than hard cash.&nbsp; Materials, equipment, assistance
with printing, free or subsidised accommodation, use of venues, etc, can
be equally valuable and may be much easier to obtain.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Local authorities can be
very helpful and an approach to the appropriate department costs nothing;
after all it is one of their duties to provide recreation and leisure facilities.&nbsp;
Local Councils own a considerable amount of land and they may be prepared
to make available parkland, industrial sites, car parks, etc, at little
or no cost.&nbsp; They also have considerable influence and their involvement
can lend a very desirable air of legitimacy and respectability to the proceedings.&nbsp;
The presence of the Mayor or Chairman of the Council flagging away competitors
at the start or presenting the awards at the finish may help not only the
image of the event but please any other sponsor by virtually guaranteeing
press coverage, at least at a local level.&nbsp; In addition the policy
may be more amenable to the idea of assisting with traffic control if the
'Chairman of the Police Commission' is beaming down from the start ramp.&nbsp;
Any approach to a Local Authority must be made in good time, the committee
system may take forever.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; A sponsorship deal must
be arranged well beforehand to achieve the maximum benefit for all parties.&nbsp;
This means at <font size=+1>least</font> six months before the date of
the rally.&nbsp; The sponsor will almost certainly want the company name
on the Supplementary Regulations for the event (SRs) and all the event
stationery.&nbsp; Similarly all pre-event publicity should include a mention
of the sponsor.&nbsp; Make sure that any agreement is confirmed in writing.&nbsp;
It is far better to spend a little time sorting things out properly at
the outset than to have misunderstanding, embarrassment and possible acrimony
later.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Always keep the sponsor
up to date with progress throughout the preparations for the rally.&nbsp;
Invite them to planning meetings and let them, if they wish, get involved.&nbsp;
You may well find that the original arrangement is supplemented by other
benefits if the sponsor appreciates your needs and is aware of the effort
that you are putting in to their event.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that the sponsor
gets an invitation to the start of the event and the prize giving.&nbsp;
Give them details of the route and information about the cars and competitors.&nbsp;
If they are interested enough to put up their money and lay the company
reputation on the line they may well wish to spectate and take friends
to see the action.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after the event
a letter of thanks will not go amiss.&nbsp; You may want a sponsor next
year.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Planning</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are a number of hoops, some of which
are mandatory, through which you must jump to run an Historic rally.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to have a date
in the rally calendar (prerequisite for obtaining permission to hold the
rally) the type of event, <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/products/Landranger/index.cfm?shop_id=1">the
maps at 1 to 50,000 scale</a>, and the date which it will take place should
be submitted to the MSA via a <a href="../starting/contacts.html">Regional
Association</a>.&nbsp; This must be done in the late spring for inclusion
in the Fixture List published in December to cover the following year.&nbsp;
If you miss the deadline you may apply direct to the MSA a minimum of two
months before your event.&nbsp; You could be planning for an event for
up to eighteen months before the date it is to run.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing the date for your
rally is of the utmost importance.&nbsp; Submitting the date and other
details through the Regional Association should ensure that clashes with
other motoring events do not occur but it is equally important to be aware
of other activities being held on the same day and taking the necessary
steps to avoid them.&nbsp; Carnivals, Rag Day Parades and even Bank Holiday
traffic can seriously disrupt your rally and you and your motor club could
be crossed off the Mayor's Christmas Card list if your route meets that
of the civic procession head on.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Historic rallying has in
the past few years been the fastest growing branch of motorsport.&nbsp;
In order to cater for the increasing band of potential competitors there
has been a corresponding development in events.&nbsp; At this point in
time saturation point may have been reached and there are possibly too
many rallies chasing too few competitors.&nbsp; Only those offering something
different and good value are likely to attract a significant number of
entrants.&nbsp; It is necessary to identify a particular niche for your
event in a competitive market.&nbsp; To this end it is important to consider
in some detail what you intend to run and who you are trying to attract.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="guideline16.html#cas">Route authorisation</a></font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; If you intend to run a traditional
road rally or a touring event using the public roads involving more than
than twelve competing vehicles, you must apply to the MSA for route authorisation
(see Blue Book, Section K).&nbsp; All motoring competitions held on the
pubic highway are governed by the Motor Vehicles (Competition &amp; Trials)
Regulations 1969.&nbsp; Under this legislation the Authorisation department
of the Motor Sports Association Limited acts as the Central Agency for
England and Wales on behalf of the Minister responsible for Transport.&nbsp;
Scotland is handled in a similar fashion, albeit with a different system
of processing, by the Royal Scottish Automobile Club.&nbsp; You may wish
to present an intricate and testing challenge to competitors in the heart
of Wales or a scenic tour through the Dartford Tunnel but in either case
you must make an application to the relevant office between two and six
months prior to the planned date of the event.&nbsp; The application must
be made on the official form (E404) and be accompanied by two duplicate
tracings, taken from current 50,000 scale O.S. maps, showing the public
highway route and detailing the control points and time schedule.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The permit</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No motorsport event may take place without
the permission of the MSA.&nbsp; The MSA signifies its approval by granting
an organising permit.&nbsp; Applications for the permit must be made on
the appropriate form not less than eight weeks before the date of a National
'A' event and not less than six weeks before the date of all other events.&nbsp;
Sections B2 to B6 of the Blue Book sets out all the ins and outs of what
you can or what you cannot do and Appendix Z lays down the fees you will
be charged.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Supplementary regulations</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SRs or Regs are the means of informing
the potential competitor what you are offering.&nbsp; They normally follow
the draft regulations submitted within the permit application form and
should contain all the details that you have given to the MSA.&nbsp; What
the SRs must include is explained fully in Section B8 of the Blue Book.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember when compiling
the 'regs' to concentrate on making them clear and unambiguous.&nbsp; If
you are running a road event give details of how many tests, how much regularity
(miles and controls), how many road miles and the nature of the navigation.&nbsp;
If you are proposing a stage event explain how many stages there will be,
what the mileage (stage and road) will be and a genuine description of
the surface of the stages.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Producing the 'regs' always
takes longer than you imagined it was going to, so allow plenty of time.&nbsp;
Aim to publish them ten to twelve weeks before the rally, six should be
an absolute minimum.&nbsp; If you leave things too late you will not get
the entries you need for a successful event.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be necessary to
print between seven hundred to a thousand sets of the SRs if you hope to
attract up to ninety competitors.&nbsp; The ratio of ten to one seems a
waste when you consider the fate of ninety per cent of the documents but
there is little alternative.&nbsp; Regrettably you must speculate to accumulate.</font></b>
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The events</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Historic events are divided into three
categories:</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stages</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road events or 'Retros'</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Touring events.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(1) Stages</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The same principles as modern events apply
in respect of vehicle safety although some waivers may be allowed for certain
ages of car.&nbsp; It is important to check these at an eady date.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An emphasis on smoother
stages is important because of the value and fragility of many of the cars
involved.&nbsp; Although there have now been a number of successful forestry
events, in general terms the most successful stage events are all on sealed
surface.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of modern events
have run successful 'tag-on' events for historic cars.&nbsp; While these
are seen as a successful method of boosting income and interest in a situation
of dwindling fields, they are not the most popular amongst historic competitors
who see themselves as a poor relation on these events.&nbsp; Under these
circumstances a separate permit must be obtained and the events must be
at least in some part different (eg, miss out a couple of rough stages)
as they are seen as different events in the eyes of the MSA.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(2) Road events or 'Retros'</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Usually there are three elements to these:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Traditional road navigation.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tests.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Regularity.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(A) Traditional road navigation</font></b></h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This part of the event must be run at a
strict 30 mph average.&nbsp; In order to make it interesting therefore
it is necessary to select challenging and twisty roads, but it should not
be necessary to resort to rough 'Whites' which are particularly unpopular
with competitors with valuable and fragile machinery.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even an A40 Somerset can
comfortably average 30 mph down most B roads so the more challenging yellows
must be selected, and it is recommended that you search hard for the most
intricate and complicated route (B) you can find within the territory available
and which does not include public relations problem spots.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Without detailed 'local
knowledge' it is not always possible to choose a route from the map.&nbsp;
It is necessary to spend some time driving around the yellow roads in your
chosen area to see which are straight and wide and which are narrow and
challenging.&nbsp; In this survey it is also important to seek out 'tricky
slots' and 'not as map' junctions, and include them in your overall route
wherever possible.&nbsp; The odd ford (as long as it isn't too deep) always
adds a bit of spice, as does the 'impossible' hairpin, and rain also helps
to make it more difficult to average 30 mph and thereby 'clean' your route.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are in an area where
there are no tight metalled roads and where it is very easy to achieve
30 mph, you have to resort to 'plot and bash', including some of the traditional
time consuming methods of navigation, such as spot heights, herringbones,
km squares, tulips or even map references out of order.&nbsp; Tread carefully
however, because a good proportion of your entry will be novice or at least
inexperienced navigators, and you don't want them to get <font size=+1>completely</font>lost,
thereby causing further PR problems as they traverse roads with dwellings
which have not been visited.&nbsp; Also, this way they get bored and don't
enjoy the event.&nbsp; Your skill as an organiser is in making your event
difficult enough so that the most expert crews feel challenged, while the
out and out novice can have a good time and understands what is required
of him even though he cannot keep to the schedule.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is more logical (and
safer) to run your traditional road navigation during the hours of darkness
and a pattern of these events has developed whereby they commence with
a daylight run of tests and regularity and then after a halt for a meal
the rally recommences with the traditional road navigation.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(B) Special Tests</font></b></h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although these are run against the clock
they are not out and out speed tests like sprints or stages but are much
slower (30 mph maximum average) and usually much shorter than special stages
so the extra safety requirements are not necessary; they are tests of driver
skill and judgement.&nbsp; They take place on private ground and it is
up to the organiser to obtain permission from the owners of suitable venues.&nbsp;
Organisers will know their own areas best but remember that a lot of factory
car parks and industrial private roads are not used at the weekend and
it's a lot easier to persuade the owners to permit historic cars at 30
mph than modern cars at 75.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have found the
sites you have to design the tests, so that no one can average more than
30 mph over the length of the test.&nbsp; There are various ways of doing
this and you will have your own ideas, but a few pertinent points are noted
below.</font></b>
<ol TYPE="i" START="i">
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stop astride a line and restart (can be
hard on old differentials so don't include too many).</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stop astride a line, reverse to another
line and restart (even harder on transmissions!).</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In and out of imaginary 'garages' and twisting
round in small spaces.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In general terms drivers don't like reversing
too often (these cars have fragile and expensive gearboxes) so about one
reverse every three tests seems to be acceptable.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The drivers prefer the more straightforward
tests, so they can go competitively without having to ask the navigator
which side to go of a particular cone.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you are letting cars off every minute
you must get all your twiddly bits over in the first part of the test,
i.e. within sight of the Start Marshal, so it's safe to let the next car
go even if the previous car hasn't reached the stop line.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Because of (vi) above radio contact between
start and finish is desirable especially if line of sight does not exist.&nbsp;
A separate exit to keep it flowing is best - avoid car parks with one entrance
so cars leaving have an exit control away from the start - it minimises
chaos.</font></b></li>
</ol>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B. Diagrams of the tests
you propose to run together with the time allowed and the length of the
test must be sent to the MSA for approval.&nbsp; You will not be allowed
to run a test which is unsafe or does not comply with the 30 mph average
speed limit.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(C) Regularity Sections</font></b></h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In these the competitor does not know where
the next control is.&nbsp; You merely tell him which way to go and how
fast until the stated end of the regularity section.&nbsp; There is no
need to have a control at the end.&nbsp; This can be given as a distance
or map reference.&nbsp; You set up secret checks at one or more points
on the regularity to check competitors are following the set route and
given average speed.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The old adage that competitors
make the best organisers applies to regularity sections more than any other
aspect of rallying except, perhaps, the choice of route for night sections
or autotests.&nbsp; Organisers must constantly bear in mind two main principles:</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Accuracy is all important.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Average speeds must be carefully chosen
to minimise complaints by general public and to give the greatest enjoyment
to competitors.</font></b></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Accuracy</font></i></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Take one example:</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; At 20 mph one mile takes
3 minutes or 180 seconds.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to put it another way
-</font></b></ol>

<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; If a competitor
is out by more than 10 yards he is a second early or late.&nbsp; Unlike
stages or test, any inaccuracy by the organiser is not 'the same for all
crews'.&nbsp; There is only one correct time and that is spot on.&nbsp;
Both earliness and lateness are penalised.&nbsp; Thus if an organiser's
mileages are wrong the perfect crew is penalised, while the crew who gets
it wrong can, gain.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete accuracy is gained
in a number of ways:</font></b></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Your measured distance must be what you
use on the event.&nbsp; A measured mile is insufficient.&nbsp; Try to get
between 3 and 4 miles on a road without junctions, roundabouts or villages
which give a choice of line.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When measuring your regularity avoid wheeispin
on the wheel you are measuring from, and drive in the middle of the correct
side of the road.&nbsp; Do not cut corners.&nbsp; Be consistent with 1.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tyre wear, and particularly tyre pressures
can vary your distance.&nbsp; Use the same car and try to measure your
regularities and your 'measured mile'at about the same time.&nbsp; Do not
do one this month and the next two months hence.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mark the start of your regularity very
accurately, e.g. by a white line on the road.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Likewise have your timing point at IRTC's
(intermediate Regularity TC's) accurately fixed.&nbsp; More on this later
under'marshalling'.</font></b></li>

<blockquote><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Choosing Average Speeds</font></i></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This comes down to common sense.&nbsp;
Take into account whether your event is run in the daylight or dark. 30
mph on narrow roads in the daytime is dangerous and crews who experience
that will not enter your event a second time.&nbsp; Likewise an average
speed much less than 30 mph on main roads is equally dangerous.&nbsp; Pick
the average speed and road so that they are ideally matched and there is
no need to 'press on' while it is not so slow to annoy other road users.&nbsp;
Try running consistently at 20 mph or less to find out how really slow
it is.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">30mph......2 minutes per mile</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">24mph......2.5 minutes per mile</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">20mph......3 minutes per mile</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17.2mph... 3.5 minutes per mile</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15mph.......4minutes per mile</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The slower you go the longer
and longer it takes!&nbsp; Lorries and other road users do not appreciate
rally cars going steadily at 20 mph on wide roads!&nbsp; If you wish to
make your event more challenging require competitors to change their average
speeds.&nbsp; This point need not be identified in the ground and there
need not be an intermediate control at the change of speed point.</font></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Controls and Route</font></i></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Plan your intermediate controls where
there is a maximum element of surprise - it is no use having one a competitor
can see half a mile away as they have ample time to adjust their speed.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear in mind that time
controls on public roads in the UK must be at least 2 miles apart.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider also the form
of route information for the regularity section and when it is to be handed
out.&nbsp; Consider map references or tulips and whether to use difficult
triangles or junctions.&nbsp; Be consistent how you drive these when measuring
your route.&nbsp; If using the latter your mileages should accord with
your regularity mileages.</font></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Marshalling and Instructions</font></i></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Never allow two cars to start a regularity
section at the same time.&nbsp; Competitors will expect to start 'on the
minute' and will appreciate a countdown 15-10-5-4-3-2-1-GO.&nbsp; If you
do and those crews are good they should remain one yard from each other
throughout the section!&nbsp; Regularities are not like stages or normal
road sections when crews go at different speeds.&nbsp; Because of this
you should not penalise crews for lateness at the start of regularities
or you should brief Marshals to give an 'in' and 'out' time; with a delay
allowance for crews who are held up through no fault of their own.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marshal at a timing
point (IRTC) needs to be very experienced.&nbsp; He must either time crews
on sight, when they pass an exact given spot, or when they stop on your
line.&nbsp; You must instruct the Marshals and also let competitors know
which method you are using.&nbsp; Bear in mind 10 yards can be one second!&nbsp;
Your instructions to the Marshal as to the exact point of timing cars is
vital to you organising a good event.&nbsp; Also let competitors know which
method you are using.&nbsp; The Marshal should also give the crew a slip
of paper showing the exact measured distance and correct time to his point.&nbsp;
If there are a series of IRTCs this should be from the last IRTC and the
start of the regularity section (should the previous IRTC be missing, etc).</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulations for your
event should give a 1 or 2 second or whatever penalty free 'window' at
an IRTC.&nbsp; This will iron out any very minor discrepancy in marshalling
or measuring distances which are bound to arise.&nbsp; The exact window
is at your discretion and can reflect your confidence in people good at
arithmetic. your organisational ability to get it as right as possible.</font></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Timing to the Minute or Second</font></i></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Timing a regularity to the minute is
not an easy solution when you have a series of IRTCS!&nbsp; Read K 17.8
and K 17.5.1 in particular, i.e. 9 minutes 59 seconds is recorded as 09
minutes.&nbsp; Now read K 15.4 which states 'the time of arrival at any
Intermediate Time Control ... with the time of arrival at the immediate
preceding Time Control'.&nbsp; The theory behind this is that it prevents
crews speeding to make up lost time.&nbsp; Once time is lost it cannot
be recovered under the Statutory Regulations (the&nbsp; law) covering rallying.&nbsp;
What this means is that if you are timing a regularity to the full minute
you&nbsp; must place your controls at the exact point where competitors&nbsp;&nbsp;
are due on a full minute.&nbsp; Failure to organise your event in this
way can result in two things.&nbsp; Firstly&nbsp; competitors must speed
to immediately recover the amount&nbsp; they are into the minute (59 seconds
in the case of K 17.5.1). This makes the event technically&nbsp; illegal.
Or it becomes a lottery every time the accumulated seconds add up to an
extra minute.</font></b></blockquote>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(3) Touring Events</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These are mainly local events for people
with older cars.&nbsp; Here Scrutineering and timing is less formal and
they often contain no timing at all and the winners may be decided by a
Concours D'Elegance or indeed there may be no overall winner at all.</font></b>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Three final points</font></b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Don't dismiss some proportion of overall
penalties as concours points as it encourages good standards of turn-out.&nbsp;
Also it keeps some of the performance heat out of it - historically right!</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Special tests are difficult to suit for
all - a tight courses means a 30 mph average may just test a Mini or Sprite,
but be impossible for a Zephyr or Rover.&nbsp; Consider an element of regularity,
i.e. time a first lap, then time a second lap - best man matches his first
time at second attempt.&nbsp; This way a good driver in a Humber Snipe
can match a wild man in a Cooper S.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many historic rallies - so many
you should ensure your date does not clash.&nbsp; Ring round the well known
<a href="../../uk_historic.html">Historic Rally Clubs</a> or the <a href="../../uk_govern.html">Motor
Sports Association</a> and you should be able to find a slot in the calendar
which will help you to attract a decent entry.</font></b></li>
