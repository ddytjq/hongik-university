        <P> 

        <FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"> 
        <P> <b>There was a time, not so long ago, when mobile phones were considered a luxury. Today, everyone's got one. But the mobile phone revolution doesn't end there - it's about to become the gateway to cyberspace.</b></P>
        <P>Despite the explosive growth of the Internet in recent years, around 18 <B>million</B> UK households still don't possess a PC. Yet when it comes to mobile phones, 16.8 million of us has got one. Infact, before the <B>millennium</B>, it is estimated one in four adults will have a mobile phone and ownership is becoming easier every day thanks to the advent of pre-pay phone packages and <B>super</B> supermarket deals retailing mobiles for <B>less</B> than a price of designer jeans. <P>So it's not surprising that the 
      <STRONG>techno-boffins </STRONG>       have decided that the next step for the worldwide web is access via your mobile, rather than a PC. The science behind this idea is WAP - the Wireless Application Protocol. </P><B></B><P><B>WAP is all the fuss about?</B></P>WAP phones do away with the need for colour screen monitors, 
      <STRONG>keyboards </STRONG>and popular browser software from the likes of 
      Microsoft and Netscape. With a <STRONG>WAP phone </STRONG>                           and a WAP browser, you get a small black and white screen and use the lower speed connections that digital phone networks currently offer. 


<P><B>WAP it catch on?</B></P>At 
      the moment the only catch is that WAP phones can only surf internet pages 
      if the likes of AOL, Yahoo and friends use WAP-friendly systems. On top of 
      that, <STRONG>web designers </STRONG>

                                will have to develop specific web pages for WAP users (to make it easier for the phones to display the information). 
<P>Many folk claim that consumers will not want a 
      <STRONG>'cut-down' </STRONG>version of the internet. After all, would you 
      swap a Nicam <STRONG>widescreen TV </STRONG>for a black &amp; white 
      portable? WAP supporters counter such skepticism by pointing out that the 
      web is all too often criticised for its <STRONG>slowness </STRONG>and that 
      with the backing of the major phone manufacturers, by 
      <STRONG>2005</STRONG>                                                            there will be more WAP phones in circulation than networked PCs. </P>

The <A href="http://www.pmn.co.uk/frameson/mobilexpo.html" target=_top>new generation</A> of mobile phones are already coming off the conveyor belts from the likes of <A href="http://www.ericsson.co.uk" target=_top>Ericsson</A>, <A href="http://www.siemens.co.uk" target=_top>Siemens</A>, <A href="http://wings.motorola.com/en/js/splashscreen.html" target=_top>Motorola</A>, <A href="http://www.samsung.com/" target=_top>Samsung</A>, <A href="http://www.alcatel.com/" target=_top>Alcatel</A>, <A href="http://www.nokia.com/main.html" target=_top>Nokia</A>, whilst mobile networks are preparing themselves for increased data traffic. <B><P>Are you WAP for it?</P></B>
