<h1>New Hampshire International Speedway</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
New Hampshire International Speedway is a 1 mile oval with
a 1.6 mile road course located near Loudon, New Hampshire;
the oval is banked 12 degrees.
In the course of a year, NHIS carries a full slate of SCCA regionals,
an SCCA National, two NASCAR Busch Grand National North races,
a NASCAR Winston Cup race, an Indycar race, and various and sundry
motorcycle races.  The Pro races are all run on the oval; the primary
user of the road course is the SCCA (I don't know what course the
motorcycles use.)

<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">Historical Note</a></h2>
NHIS is built on the site of the old Bryar Motorsports Park;
the NHIS road course does not use any of the old Bryar track,
although the outfield section somewhat resembles the
corresponding section of the old track (albeit run in the opposite
direction.)

<h2><a name="TrackMap">Track Map</a></h2>
There are presently two track maps available; one of the 1.6 mile
road course based on the 1 mile oval, and one of the old Bryar
Circuit.
<p>
This is the old Bryar circuit that was plowed under
and replaced by the new circuit:

<p>
The following map shows the road course and oval.  Note that optionally,
on either end of the oval the oval may be used instead of the infield
road course, allowing three different road course configurations to be used.

Directions:  Take 93N, 3N, Everett Turnpike N, 89S or whatever to get to
Concord.  Stay on 93N until exit 15 (gosh, I hope the number is right!, I'm
usually on autopilot).  Take Exit 15 to 393E.  Take the 2nd exit to Route
106.  At the light, turn left onto 106.  The track is about 9 miles north
on 106.  Watch your speed when it briefly drops to 40 around the traffic
light, you might be, uhh, late for registration.  Stop at the 106 Beanstalk
(on your left) for gas and munchies.  The track is only about a mile north
of it.

garages - you can rent them by the event or by the season, by the season is
cheaper, contact the track for details.
<p>
The paddock is half paved, half garaged, and half grass.  The inner most
paddock is LOCKED tight around 8PM.  If you park in there, you will not be
able to leave.
<p>
brakes - bring plenty of brakes, you will need them.  Make sure your brakes
lines are also in tip top shape, we seriously crunch about 1 car a year at
T3 due to brake failure.  The workers all get a long lunch, emergency
services gets to miss lunch, and a racer gets to build a new car.  I'm
serious, check your brakes.
<p>
gas - is available, I don't know what flavors or prices
<p>
fluids - can be dumped in the specified tanks.  I know they take oil and
antifreeze, there may be other places.
<p>
The "media center" is in the building between the restaurant and the front
straight, just hope you aren't summoned there.  ("Your appeal is not well
founded and will not be heard")
<p>
<h2><a name="WorkersGuide">A Worker's Guide to New Hampshire International Speedway</a></h2>
The showers are hot and there are plenty of them.  There are showers in the
main paddock, the secondary inner paddock, and a few outside the oval.
There is an airconditioned restaurant (The Checkered Flag) which serves all
sorts of usual track food for breakfast and lunch.  Race control and T&S
are also air conditioned.  The bathrooms are very clean.
<p>
Race control is at the top of the enormous grandstands, take the elevator
to 2, out onto the roof, straight through the door and it is the first room
on the left.  Tech is located in the "new" garages, right behind victory
lane. Grid is located at Pit Out but there is talk of changing it.  Race
medical is inside Nascar 4, T&S is right behind it. Sound readings are
posted there. Green course is usually 8:30 or 9:00 both on Saturdays and
Sundays.
<p>
The inner most paddock is LOCKED tight around 8PM.  If you park in there,
you will not be able to leave.  Some workers camp on the ashpalt, some on
the grass, and some outside the oval, just behind the buildings outside the
tunnel.

<h3>Fine Dining and Otherwise</h3>
The Eggshell restaurant is around the corner from the Beanstalk on 106;
it is rumored to be both good and cheap.
<p>
For more restaurtants, take 106 South until just before 393.  
There is a popular place on your left, looks like seafood 
since they have anchors and nets and stuff outside.  Continue 
just past 393 and immediately turn right on 9.  In a couple of 
miles you hit restaurant city.  Vinos and the Chinese place 
are popular racer hangouts.  The Red Lobster, well, this is 
New England, you can do a lot better for a lot less if you 
want seafood.
<p>
If you keep going straight, and eventually make a right (sorry 
I can remember the cross street) you will be in a mini mall 
where you can buy food and beer and wine (no beer and wine 
sales between 11PM and 6AM).  This is also exit 14 off of 93.
