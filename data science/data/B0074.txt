            Building Society has always been committed to mutuality. It is our 
            principal philosophy and its benefits can be felt across all parts 
            of the Society. But what exactly does mutuality mean? What does it 
            mean to our customers? To our employees? To the communities in which 
            we operate? And what can we do as a mutual organisation that might 
            not otherwise be possible?</b></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">For 
              us, mutuality means putting you, the customer, first. Unlike a PLC, 
              a mutual organisation does not have to maximise profits in order 
              to satisfy the demands of shareholders. A mutual is therefore able 
              to plough profits back into its business with the benefits of doing 
              so felt by very many more people.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">As 
              a mutual, the Newcastle is able to operate a more competitive interest 
              rate structure than many competing plcs. We can keep the margin, 
              or difference, between the rate we charge our borrowers and the 
              rate we pay our savers, as low as possible.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">With 
              ever increasing competition in the marketplace, we know you don't 
              have to remain with the Newcastle, although we obviously think you're 
              wise to do so! As a mutual, we're able to reward our members' loyalty 
              through discounts for long-term borrowers and savers. These loyalty 
              bonuses are provided straight from the Society's profit margin.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">So 
              while we cannot always claim to offer the best rate on every account,

              diverse range of products.</font></p>

              At Newcastle Building Society, we believe we can exploit technology 
              in order to benefit our members through increased choice and greater 
              flexibility. Today's hectic lifestyle means more and more of our 
              members want to conduct business at a time and place convenient 
              to them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">Last 
              year, we launched two major new initiatives which were designed 
              to enhance value and widen the choice of options already available 
              to members. We were the first building society in the UK to offer 
              a mortgage approval in principle facility on interactive digital 
              television, in conjunction with Telewest. By the end of the year, 
              the facility, provided on our full range of mortgage products, was 
              available to four million homes in the UK.</font></p>

              followed that by becoming one of the first building societies to 
              offer an on-line savings account via the Internet and while security 
              difficulties have dogged some of the other financial institutions, 
              which have subsequently launched similar accounts, NewcastleNet 
              savings has operated without problems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2"> 
              But technology won't stand still and neither will we. In 2001, we 
              will be launching a range of other new products and services which 
              will make full use of technological advances. As an example, we 
              will set up a virtual shopping mall from which customers can purchase 
              a vast array of products and services, at lower than High Street 
              prices, via Internet terminals in our branches.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">We 
              will continue to take advantage of technology and we hope these

              important roles to play. Take our branches for example. We have 
              53 of them across the UK and in Gibraltar. Some, particularly those 
              on the High Street, are busy all day, every day. Others, those in 
              more remote locations, are less busy and if you consider nothing

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Humanst521 BT" size="2">But 
              these branches play such an important part in the lives of those 
              people who do use them. Not everyone has access to the Internet, 
              or has digital television in their home or carries a mobile telephone. 
              A great number of people still prefer face-to-face contact with

              We're using technology to extend members' choice of options. But 
              that choice has to include the more traditional methods of communication

                    capital as a percentage of shares and borrowings</b>.<br>
                    Gross capital represents reserves plus subscribed capital. 
                    The purpose of capital is to provide a buffer against any 
                    losses arising from a society's activities, thereby protecting 
                    investors' funds. The gross capital ratio measures the extent 
                    to which a society's activities are funded by capital, compared 
                    to shares and borrowings. The higher this ratio is, the greater 
                    the protection for investors.</font></p>

                    <b>Liquid assets as a percentage of shares and borrowings</b>. 
                    <br>
                    Liquid assets are assets held by a society which are in the 
                    form of cash or assets which are readily convertible into 
                    cash. Newcastle Building Society has a ratio of liquid assets 
                    to shares and borrowings which is at a similar level to other 
                    societies. The ratio is maintained at a level which the directors 
                    consider appropriate for the activities of the Society.</font></p>

                    for the year as a percentage of mean total assets</b>. <br>
                    A society needs to make a reasonable level of profit each 
                    year in order to maintain and strengthen its gross capital 
                    ratio. The Newcastle Building Society operates a policy of 
                    profit sufficiency and one of the most appropriate measures 
                    of profitability is to express profit as percentage of mean 
                    total assets. Our ratio of profit to mean total assets is 
                    similar to that achieved by large and medium-sized societies.

                    expenses are the costs of running the Society and comprise 
                    administrative expenses, depreciation and amortisation. The 
                    lower this ratio is, the greater a society's efficiency. The 
                    Society's management expenses ratio has fallen for the last 
                    six years and at 1.02%, is at a level similar to or lower 
                    than that achieved by other societies of comparable asset 
                    size.</font></p>
