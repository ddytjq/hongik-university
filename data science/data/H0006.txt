<P><B><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Introduction.<BR></SPAN></B><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Human is in biological terms a 
mammal belonging to the primates and closely related to the African apes, but 
nevertheless, we have unique traits which are far outside the characteristics of 
any other animal of the world among which the most spectacular ones are the 
erect manner of walking and the bipedal stride, the peculiar behaviour in 
relation to the two sexes, the power of speech, and the very peculiar kind of 
inward activity, the consciousness or ego-feeling which some may call "the 
soul". In the following is presented a proposal on how these characteristics may 
have originated. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">During the last century 
fossils have been discovered which represent prehistoric forms closely related 
to man&#8217;s ancestors, fossils with names of <I>Australopithecus, Homo erectus, 
Homo habilis </I>and others, all of which surely were bipedal with an upright 
stance. But if they possessed the other characteristics of man is uncertain, as 
it cannot be seen from fossilised bones if the being was able to speak and 
think, or what kind of life it lived. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Bipedal 
origin. <BR></SPAN></B><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">According to the Darwinian evolutionary 
principle of the survival of the fittest, the erect posture, and walking in a 
two-footed striding by balancing the body on the hind legs must have implied 
some advantages. But the upright bipedal stride is in no way fast and easy, and 
it is far from energy saving. In comparison with the four-footed manner of 
locomotion in most mammals it is slow, uncomfortable, and troublesome, and it 
has never been adopted by any other mammal. A change from a four-footed manner 
of walking into the upright bipedal manner is thus hard to imagine as in any way 
advantageous. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Therefore the erect 
posture and the bipedal walking were not initiated by a four-footed human 
ancestor. </SPAN></I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The 
brachiators.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Back in the Tertiary a broad zone of forests 
stretched from Africa and the Northern Europe to the Eastern Asia. In these 
forests lived many species of four-footed monkeys. They lived in the treetops, 
and they moved by walking along the branches, balancing by their long tails in 
the manner to be seen in the modern monkeys of the South American 
forests.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Eventually some of these 
four-footed monkeys attained a brachiatory manner of moving hanging by their 
hands under the branches, swinging on their arms. In this manner they were able 
to reach far longer out on the thin branches to take the fruits which grew 
there. As they specialised to this manner of locomotion, they did no longer need 
the long tail for balancing, why this was reduced and vanished. They ceased to 
be four-footed monkeys: <I>they were two-footed apes with strong, movable arms 
and hands and no tail.</I><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Gradually the upper part of 
their body became broad and they had shoulders, and their shoulder blades were 
no longer situated on the side of the chest as in monkeys and most other 
mammals, they were removed to the back. And many species of such brachiatory 
apes emerged, most of them rather small ones.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">These two-footed apes, 
which spent almost all their time in the treetops, held their bodies upright in 
a vertical position, head up and feet down, when they were sitting, climbing, 
and moving.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When they occasionally 
dismounted the trees to stay on the ground, they maintained the vertical posture 
and tottered erect on their hind legs in the manner to be seen in the Asian 
gibbons and siamangs. Only sometimes they stooped and supported the upper part 
of the body on the forelimbs as that is a more comfortable manner of locomotion 
on the ground than the erect manner. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">About 10 million years ago 
the areas of forests began to minimise and were replaced by open bush-land and 
plains. This caused that many animals of the forests disappeared, but some 
species managed to live in the open plains.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Of these some herbivore 
mammals, which used to live on leaves, adapted as grass-eaters on the plains and 
became horses, elephants, oxen, deer, antelopes and others. And carnivore 
mammals of the forests migrated to the plains to live on the herbivores. Those 
were the ancestors of the modern predatory mammals, cats and 
dogs.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Some brachiatory apes, 
however extremely specialised to live in trees, also managed to migrate to the 
plains. As they were quite unfit to live on the ground and had no possibility to 
seek shelter in trees, they should soon have been chased down by predators and 
killed as they moved slowly and had little possibility to defend themselves. But 
they were saved by their particular manner of walking on the ground, tottering 
erect on their hind legs.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Carnivores predators have a 
mode of chasing and killing their prey which is an innate pattern and they are 
therefore little apt to chase and kill animals which by shape and behaviour are 
different from their usual prey. Also modern carnivores, lions, tigers wolves, 
etc., are very little inclined to chase and kill people as their prey, because 
the human shape and behaviour is not a relevant stimulus for hunting. 
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">This is why some of the 
former brachiatory apes were able to survive at the plain. <I>It was those which 
maintained the erect stance and walked on their hind-limbs</I> and did not take 
to the stooping posture.<I> They appeared quite different from any usual prey, 
and they were not recognised by the predators as prey.</I><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">And if such erect creatures 
timorously waved their arms and maybe beat with a stick, they were so dissimilar 
to any other kind of animal that a chasing predator might not even recognise 
them as such and left them alone. The beasts did not "know"<SUP> </SUP>by 
instinct that such an upright and quite unpredictable "thing" was a prey, and 
they did not "know" by instinct how to kill it.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Those apes, which 
maintained the uncomfortable erect posture and bipedal striding, thus survived 
on the plains, and were gradually adapted to live there. <I>Those were the human 
ancestors</I>. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The bipedal manner of 
locomotion, which saved the human ancestors from falling victims of the beasts 
of prey, was in no other way beneficial. It was a slow, unsteady, and fatiguing 
manner of walking, and it was difficult to keep the upper part of the body in 
balance over the hips, as that requires a particular musculature and legs which 
are adapted for walking on the ground and not for climbing in 
trees.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Therefore the former 
brachiators were constantly tempted to bend forward to support on the arms and 
hands. But those which moved in that manner was jeopardised, as the sloping, 
arm-supporting manner of walking made them look like the four legged prey which 
the predators used to chase and thus deprived them of their protection. The 
human ancestors therefore were those, which maintained the upright stance and 
eventually developed the necessary musculature to stand and move upright and had 
legs fit for walking on the ground. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">They evolved broad hip 
sockets on which the hip muscles attached, and they evolved strong muscles 
behind the thighs and the pelvis to keep the body steady. And their legs and 
feet changed as to be adapted to the bipedal manner of walking on the ground: 
they got locking knee joints, elongated heel bones, and aligned and lengthen big 
toes.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Other anatomical changes 
occurred to make the human ancestors adapted to the new manner of life:<BR>In 
ordinary four-footed animals the spine has the shape of an arch from the neck to 
the tail, and the spine of the brachiators was much like that. That shape of the 
spine made it especially difficult to keep balance when standing or walking 
upright as it made the upper part of the body to slope 
forward.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In order to counteract this 
handicap and to keep the centre of gravity over the feet they evolved a bend of 
their loins so that the slightly arched spine sloped in behind, giving the spine 
an S-shape, making the pelvis slope forward. Then they could keep the upper part 
of the body over the feet, and they needed not to walk with the knees bent. This 
made their upright manner of walking more comfortable, but the price was the 
weak loin which is a characteristic of man. </SPAN><A 
href="http://home13.inet.tele.dk./palm/grafic/homfig.gif"><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">See fig.</SPAN></A><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Although the upright stance 
was uncomfortable, it nevertheless had its advantages. In the forests their 
ancestors had lived mostly on soft, sappy fruits, but on the plain they had to 
live mostly on seed and kernels of grass and bushes and on roots. By then they 
had use for their hands to collect and carry their food, which made it more 
necessary to them to walk without supporting on the arms and hand. And their 
hands, which was adapted for grasping of branches evolved great mobility and 
sensibility; they were real hands, fit for manipulation and 
tactility.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The adaptation to the new 
kind of food caused a change of their teeth. These were originally evolved for 
chewing of soft and sappy fruits, and their molars got flat, knotty crowns, fit 
for crushing hard seed and kernels.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The brachiators of the 
forest had large incisors, which were an efficient weapon and also an efficient 
tool to tear the tough peel of fruits. On the plain they did not need these 
incisors, partly because they no more lived on fruits, but also because their 
upright stance and their ability to beat with sticks and throw stones was a 
better protection against predators. Their incisors therefore could be reduced, 
and the dentition became human. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The adaptation to the life 
on the plain caused also other changes of the former 
brachiators:<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In the forests they used to 
move slowly around in the shadow of the trees, and they did not need to move far 
about as there were plenty of food for them.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">On the open, sunny plain, 
however, they should walk far about in the fatiguing, upright manner to gather 
enough food. They were heated and had to evolve means to cool down. Therefore 
they abandoned the fur, and they evolved sweat glands so that evaporating sweat 
could cool their naked body. In order to protect the head against the sunbeams, 
they got dense hair on the head.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Apes.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The human ancestors were not the 
only primates, which left the forests of the Northern Africa. Some of the 
monkeys did the same, but as they had never abandoned the four-footed manner of 
walking, they continued to walk in that manner on the plain. Those were the 
ancestors of the baboons, which survived by living in groups and by evolving 
very large, sharp incisors by which they could defend themselves against 
predators. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Some of the first 
brachiators, which left the forests to live on the plain, migrated to sites with 
dense weedy vegetation. Here they could stay in reasonable security from 
predators, and the strenuous upright manner of walking was not a necessity. They 
could walk in the stooped manner and support the body on their arms and fists. 
Those were the ancestors of the gorillas, and they maintained the long incisors 
for defence, but also as tools for tearing tough 
vegetables.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Another group of 
brachiators migrated to other places with trees. Here they could seek protection 
from predators by climbing up in the trees. Those were the ancestors of the 
chimpanzees, which also attained the stooping manner of walking, supporting on 
the fists. They also retained their large incisors for 
defence.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A parallel evolution might 
later on have taken place in Asia, which also was covered with forests with 
monkeys and brachiators. Some of these brachiators also began to live on the 
ground and attained the stooping, fist-supported manner of walking. Those were 
the ancestors of the orang-utans. As the forests of Asia did not decrease to the 
same degree, some of the brachiator apes were able to stay and survive as such. 
The gibbons are descendants of the brachiators, which never left the trees.

together in family-groups of a mature male and some females with their young 
ones. And as it is the case of most other animals the mature males could not 
stand each other, especially when the present females were in mating, so when 
the young males were mature they were driven away by the older male. Then the 
young males had to drift about in solitude until they were big and strong enough 
to drive an older or weakened male away and to take over his females. Or the 
young males might take over some females from families, which had become too big 
for the male and constitute a family of their own. This pattern of life is still 
to be found in gorillas and many monkeys.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When the brachiators left 
the forests to live on the plain, they maintained this manner of family-life, 
the old male driving the young ones away from the family to live by themselves 
until they were able to establish their own family. But in the open plain, 
outside the forests, the young males could not live in solitude. They were 
mature only in sexual respect, small and very young and very little apt to take 
care of themselves. Their anxiety and insecurity away from their family forced 
them to live together in groups as this gave them some mutual 
protection.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">For males to live together 
in a group was, however, against their nature as they had the inborn instinct of 
driving other males away. These male-groups were therefore characterised by 
frustrations, aggressions and scuffles, but the necessity of sticking together 
forced them to evolve a mutual tolerance. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In these male-groups there 
must have been a certain order of precedence depending on how some distinguished 
themselves from the others. Some might obtain a higher rank simply by being the 
older, the bigger, or the stronger ones, whereas others might distinguish 
themselves by being the more aggressive or the cleverer. Others might 
distinguish themselves by audacity or inventiveness. And those, which 
distinguished themselves, marked the pattern of behaviour of their entire group 
which could be rather different from other groups. Some groups might have been 
characterised by violence and great aggressiveness whereas other groups might 
have been characterised by courage or by ingenuity.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When such drifting groups 
of young males encountered, noisy and bloody fights must have arisen, and the 
most aggressive, the most inventive or the cleverest ones conquered them. 
Therefore these qualities eventually were selected.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A young male, which was 
driven from his family, had only little possibility to survive alone on the open 
plain, and he must as fast as possibly find a male-group to join. And when he 
found one, he certainly was met by suspicion and should cautiously follow the 
group until gradually he was accepted and he could be admitted as a member of 
the group.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The members of these groups 
of sexually mature males lived in a state of constant sexual excitement, and 
this was greatly stimulated when they encountered a family with mature females. 
The excited young males went straight for the females to mate with them, and 
those with the highest rank of the group, the most distinguished, with 
precedence to the females. The old male of the family had only little 
possibility to resist such group of highly excited, aggressive younger males and 
was sure to be wounded or killed, and the most dominating of the younger males 
then mated with the females.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When the fights and the 
matings, which surely were mostly like rapes, were over and the young males had 
satisfied their drifts, they left the females and went on with their drifting 
"bachelor-life". None of the male-group could take over the former male&#8217;s place 
of the female-family, as the young males&#8217; mutual rivalry prevented this. Thus 
the family-group was left without a male and drifted on as a group of females 
with their kids.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Hence the old-fashioned 
families disappeared and a new kind of group emerged: Female-groups with kids 
and no mature males. Most likely the females deliberately banished their 
grown-up male kids from their group, because an encounter with a drifting 
male-group could be lesser violent if grown-up males were not present in the 
female-group.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The life in the 
female-groups was very different from that in the groups of the aggressive, 
excited and restless males. The females, which were in any state of pregnancy 
and had young ones of any age to take care of, moved quietly about, occupied by 
seeking food and nursing their kids.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Men and 
women.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Other 
animals than human beings mate only at periods when the females can be 
fertilised, that is when the females are on heat. Outside these periods, the 
females reject males which try to mate with them.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">On the contrary when the 
females are on heat. Then they are inclined to be mated and prompt the males by 
particular behaviours or signals. Then the mating occurs after a mating dance, 
which has a character of a ritual. When the mating has taken place and the 
female has been fertilized, the mating inclination of the females cease. 
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">This pattern of alternation 
between periods of mating inclination and periods when the females reject the 
males was the original characteristic of the hominids. And it was a convenient 
pattern when the females lived in family-groups together with a male who could 
mate with the females when they were inclined to.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When the females began to 
live in groups of their own without a male they could be mated and fertilized 
only when their group happened to encounter a drifting male-group, and only the 
females that happened to be on heat at that time which were fertilized. The 
females which were not in heat and not inclined to be mated at this particular 
event, might be raped and wounded, maybe even killed, whereas those females 
which happened to be on heat and willing to be mated, were saved and fertilized. 
Therefore the females, which were on heat at the longest periods and willingly 
received the sexually excited males, had a great possibility to survive and a 
greater possibility to be pregnant and give birth to kids.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Because of that the females 
<I>which had the longest periods of mating</I> were naturally selected, and 
eventually the alternating periods ceased. The females were inclined to mate 
when they were mature, and this inclination lasted until it ceased after some 
years when a menopause, the climacteric, occurred. Thus the peculiar pattern of 
human sexual behaviour evolved, different from any other mammals, including our 
closest relatives, the gorillas and chimpanzees.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When a male-group met a 
female-group and the excited males initiated a mating, they went for the females 
which by build were most "female-like", mostly differed from males and tall 
kids. That is those which had broad hips and breasts. Such females were 
therefore selected, and the females evolved another build than the males; the 
females became women.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The males also evolved 
particular traits. It was those, which were most impressive to the other males 
of the group and gave precedence when the group met a female-group. Especially 
it was strength and heavy figure, which gave precedence, but also a beard and a 
tall penis was impressive to the other males and gave precedence. Therefore the 
males evolved these particular traits. The males became 
men!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Groups become 
tribes.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The 
vigorous, aggressive and restless male-groups drifted still longer about. By 
their increasing inventiveness, curiosity and inclination for vigorous behaviour 
they began to hunt other animals, which they killed and ate. They got the taste 
for meat, which diet was much more nourishing that the grains and fruits of 
which they used to nourish. The males became hunters.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The possibility to get 
greater amounts of meat made the male-groups particular attractive to the 
females, which had very good use for such a diet. The female-groups therefore 
began to join the male-groups, and they made the males share their game with 
them. In return they could offer sexual satisfaction. The females got meat for 
sex! <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Eventually a new kind of 
groups arose as the two kinds of groups united into one, the mixed groups of 
males and females. The males still drifted about in a group of their own, but 
they returned to the females with their game, and to have sexual 
satisfaction.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In these mixed groups a new 
pattern of behaviour occurred: The individual females joined individual males, 
and families emerged as a part of the group. The groups became 
tribes.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

man could be considered a being of intelligence, contrary to animals, which in 
this sense could be considered beings of instinct. And it may be an useful model

instinctive behaviour that the acts are immediate reactions to a need. If the 
animal needs to have food, is hungry, it is motivated to make some acts, which 
generally are apt to satisfy that need. When the need is satisfied, that is when 
the animal has eaten and is not hungry anymore, the motivation 
ceases.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The acts, which the animals 
make to satisfy a need, are neither the result of considerations nor of insight 
and experience. They are determinated by a <I>hereditary program</I>, which has 
been evolved through numerous generations by the principle of natural selection 
as it gives the species the best possibilities to survive in its particular 
environments.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The acts, which the animal 
is hereditarily programmed to make, may be very complicated and very complex, 
and they may be determinated by very specific circumstances in connection with 
their making. But it is not what the animal thinks about; it just performs the 
acts.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Through innumerable 
generations the ancestors of the hominids had evolved such hereditary behaviour 
programs. But these programs were particularly adapted to the life of the 
forests. And when the hominids began to live at the plain many of these 
"forest-programs" were of no use. The situations, which in the forests provoked 
the motivations, might not have existed at the plain, and acts to satisfy the 
needs were not possible outside the forest.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When hungry, the 
forest-living ancestors of the hominids were motivated to follow the program: 
Climb a tree and eat the fruits, which grow there. But this program could not be 
followed at the plain with no trees!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">At the plain they were also 
presented with situations, which did not motivate them at all. The appearance of 
a predator of the plain may have been that different from the appearance of any 
predator of the forest that it did not motivate them to follow any 
program.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">At the plain the hominids 
therefore could not use their hereditary behaviour programs. But they could, as 
many other animals <I>learn</I> new motivations and new acts, according to the 
principle of conditioned reflex. And those individuals who had the best ability 
to learn new motivations and new acts were those that generally had the best 
possibilities to survive in the new environment.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">If a hominid saw a chasing 
predator, this should have motivated it to climb a tree, but as no trees were 
present it might, perhaps as a mere accidental reaction of panic in an unknown 
situation, wave the arms. And if this reaction made the predator to withdraw, 
the satisfaction this gave, may have caused that this particular new act was 
maintained as a new program, special for that individual. And the next time this 
individual was threatened by a predator, it was motivated to perform the new 
act.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In that manner the

style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The 
pre-language.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Man&#8217;s language is likely to have evolved from a 
similar hereditary pattern of behaviour, which our ancestors used in the forest: 
Various signal-sounds motivated by various situations, and various adequate 
reactions motivated by the signal-sounds respectively. This pattern of behaviour 
was evolved through numerous generations as adequate of the life as forest 
dwellers.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">As our ancestors began to 
live in surroundings, which were quite new to them, in the open plains, many of 
the situations, which were related to sound-signals, did no longer exist. And 
the adequate reactions to the situations, which used to provoke the signals 
might not have been possible. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A sound-signal which 
usually was uttered by the sight of a particular beast of pray, had no meaning 
if this beast did not live on the plain, and the reaction to the signal, such as 
to climb high in the tree, could not be performed where it were no 
trees.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">But they still had the 
innate behaviour to make soundings and to react on them.</SPAN></I><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Surely this was 
frustrating, and it could have made the pattern of sound-signals and reactions 
useless, but some of the plain-dwellers were nevertheless able by<I> learning 
</I>to use the pattern by connecting the soundings to new situations, and to 
connect the soundings to new adequate reactions.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">And as these connections 
were not inborn, but should be <I>learned,</I> they could vary and be different 
from the one group to another.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The principle of connecting 
various situations to various signal-sounds, and to connect various 
signal-sounds to various acting&#8217;s, was maintained as an innate part of 
plain-dwellers behaviour, but the <I>connections</I> of particular situations to 
the particular signals, and particular signals to particular acts, was no longer 
innate; it should be learned by each individual. And the better the individual 
was to learn this, the greater was its chance to survive in the new 
surroundings. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">By the principle of natural 
selection this new kind of behaviour was gradually improved, and in order to 
perform the various soundings with the exactness which was necessary to be 
distinguished, the power of controlling the vocal cords, the lips, tongue, and 
jaw was improved. The speech organs evolved. At the same time the power to 
distinguish the different soundings evolved.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Then the sound-signals 
really got the character of a <I>language,</I> an innate ability to use 
soundings and to react on them, <I>but with no innate relation of the soundings 
to situations, and no innate relation of the soundings to adequate 
reactions</I>.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The 
proto-language.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Regardless of the refining of the speech organs 
and the ability to distinguish between various soundings there is a narrow limit 
to how many kind of soundings, which can be made, and how many kind of soundings 
it is possible to distinguish. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">This problem was solved, 
however, by performing <I>more soundings in sound-sequences:</I> Two different 
soundings, "A" and "B" put together make two new signals, "AB" and "BA". And put 
together in sequences of three - or more - soundings, made it possible to 
perform and distinguish a great number of different signals with different 
meanings from only the original two soundings: "A", "B", "AB", "BA", "ABA", 
"BAB", "AAB", "BAA", "BBA" etc. By a very limited number of soundings, which 
were easy to perform and to distinguish, could be made an unlimited number of 
signals, which also easily could be performed and 
distinguished.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The invention of the 
sound-sequences was a turning point in the origin of the human evolution, 
because now the real language was invented. It was a language, sequences of 
soundings or "<I>syllables"</I>, relating to various 
situations.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">And that is what 
characterises the human language: It consists of relatively few characteristic 
soundings, which are put together in different sequences and get different 
meanings.</SPAN></I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The signal soundings were, 
however, not the only soundings of our ancestors when they lived in the forest. 
Like many other flock-living animals they also used soundings, which were 
uttered in order to keep the flock together. That was especially convenient in 
the dense forest where the individuals of the flock could not see each other. 
Such <I>flock-soundings</I> had no "meaning" as they were not motivated by 
specific situations and were not meant to motivate specific acts. They simply 
made each individual able to hear where the others of the flock 
stayed.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Surely they also made 
sounds, which did not mean anything, but had the purpose of indicating the mood 
of the individual. It was different soundings if the individual was at ease or 
if it was scared, angry or excited. When an individual was offended by another 
one, it might utter a sounding, which motivated the other one to cease the 
offence, and thus made it unnecessary to apply violence. Such 
<I>mood-soundings</I> regulated the mutual behaviour in the 
flock.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The hominids also brought 
these flock- and mood-soundings to the plain. And as the signal-sounding system 
was developed, the flock- and mood-soundings also gradually were a part of the 
language.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In that manner the 
signal-soundings, the flock-soundings, and the mood-soundings developed into a 
language, which was different from the one group to the other. Besides to 
regulate the mutual behaviour, the sounding also made the others able to hear if 
an individual belonged to the group or was a stranger, which "spoke a different 
language".<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Conclusion.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">As the language at a very early 
stage evolved from sounds with different meanings in various flocks, it seems of 
little relevance to discuss what were the original words. Certainly the sounds 
had some original character, which change as the organs of making them were 
refined and the power of distinguishing between them was sophisticated, which 
might have happened differently in various flocks and 
tribes.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In combination with the 
development of the power of speech the ability to distinguish between different 
situations and acts was equally developed. Thus the hominids got a 
differentiated recognition of their surroundings and their world. Thereby they 
crossed the border between animals and man. They became human 
beings!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><B><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Consciousness.<BR></SPAN></I></B><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Philosophers and psychologists have 
considered what consciousness is, this peculiar mental phenomenon which we know 
from ourselves as an inward screen at which actual and earlier sense impressions 
together with ideas and feelings can be recognised and processed by the ego. It 
seems reasonably that it evolved together with the language and the power of 
speech.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When the pre-hominids used 
the signal-sounds, there was the direct connection between the particular 
situation and a particular sound. And there was a direct connection between that 
particular sound and a particular act. When a pre-hominid spotted a chasing 
predator, it made the particular signal-sound as a hereditary reflex. The 
pre-hominids thus spotted a situation and made a signal, which was heard by 
another individual which made an act, also as a hereditary reflex. 
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">But the individual which 
actually saw the predator, did not only make the sound, <I>it also performed the 
act itself</I>. The immediate spotting of the dangerous situation thus released 
two reactions in the same individual: 1. The signal-sound, and 2. The 
act.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When the hominids began to 
live outside the forest, the inborn connection between the situation, the 
signal, and the act was dissolved. It was no longer the situation, which 
determined the acts they made; <I>the act was determined by the sound, which was 
uttered by the individual itself.</I><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The evolution was 
this:<BR>1. Originally there was a direct connection between the experienced 
situation and the performed act. The individual experiences a situation, and 
this experience motivates the individual to perform an inborn, reflexive 
act.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

forelimbs for locomotion, their hands were relieved as tools, apt to handle 
sticks, stones and other objects. And their hands became tactile remedies. By 
this they got another conception of their world in which they lived. Their world 
did not any longer consist only of visionary, audible, and olfactory 
impressions; their world was tactile. It came to consist of <I>things</I> with 
firmness and structure, and of things, which could be changed. The hominids were 
motivated to <I>use </I>the things and to <I>make</I> things. They were 
inventive.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The upright hominids arose in North 
Africa and here they developed the human body, but it was not where the further 
evolution as human beings took place.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Some of the groups 
eventually drifted far away from their original places, and they came to 
territories in which they were met by still greater demands on their capacity to 
invent tools and methods as well as to their power to speak and think. It was a 
great evolutionary pressure further to evolve these 
powers.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">By the further development 
of these capacities the hominids were increasingly capable to survive in new 
surroundings. But their capacity to live<I> where they came from was also 
increased</I>. Groups constantly returned to the places from where they had 
emanated, and here they soon out competed those, which had stayed there, due to 
their greater ability to speak and think, and due to their capacity to make 
tools. Their original resorts were thus taken over by still more developed 
hominids. The older and lesser-developed forms may have been killed, but more 
likely they were driven away.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The more developed the 
hominids were, the more able they were to survive in more distant places where 
the conditions of life were lesser optimal. In such distant places a further 
development of the powers of speaking and thinking, and of inventiveness took 
place. And the power of making tools and remedies was further improved. And all 
the time there were flocks, which returned to the more comfortable sites and 
competed the more primitive hominids that lived there.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Thus the humans gradually 
expanded as still more human capacities were evolved. Human therefore cannot be 
said to have arisen at a certain place in the world; they evolved gradually in 
still greater distances from the original resorts, and the more they migrated 
from their original sites to uncomfortable territories which made greater 
demands on their particular human qualities, speech and inventiveness, the more 
human they became.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">And the more human they 
were, the greater were their possibility to compete the more primitive hominids, 
which still lived in the more comfortable territories with lesser 
demands.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Because of this interaction 
of migration to uncomfortable and demanding territories and return to 
comfortable, lesser demanding places, the humans were spread all over the 
earth.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
