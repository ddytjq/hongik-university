    <!--/NOEDIT-->&quot;The thing I enjoyed the most was the opportunity
      to work for seven years with really competent people,&quot; said
      Dr. Loren Acton, a payload specialist on Spacelab 2. Acton was
      then with the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory. He now
      is with the Montana State University in Bozeman.</P>

      <P>&quot;It was a pleasure to be part of a program where you
      could count on everyone. It was a wonderful experience to be
      involved in so many different fields of science.&quot; On his
      flight in 1985, Acton, a solar physicist, also worked on experiments
      in plant growth, vitamin D metabolism, and infrared, X-ray, and
      cosmic ray astrophysics.

      European Space Agency (ESA) in the 1970s and early '80s as its
      entry into manned space flight. When Space Shuttle development
      started in the early 1970s, NASA recognized that it needed a
      facility that would allow scientists to conduct research on the
      Shuttle while in orbit. A permanent space station was still several
      years in the future, and scientists wanted to expand on research
      and lessons from the Skylab space station.</P>

      <P>At the same time, ESA wanted to become involved in manned
      space flight. After exploring several options, NASA and ESA agreed
      upon a modular research laboratory - soon called Spacelab - that
      would fit inside the Shuttle's payload bay. The two basic sets
      of hardware allowed scientists to conduct experiments inside
      - protected in a pressurized module - or outside - with instruments
      mounted on pallets exposed to space.</P>

      <P>Building on its experience from the three-man Skylab space
      station (1973-74), NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center was placed
      in charge of Spacelab development and missions and, later, payload
      control during missions. Space Sciences Laboratory scientists
      would serve as mission scientists and as principal or co-investigators,
      and large teams would become involved in support roles during
      the missions.

      a little experience when it flew engineering models of Spacelab
      pallets on the second and third Shuttle missions in 1982-83.
      The pallets were not fully outfitted, and the flight crew had
      to divide their time between testing the Shuttle, their primary
      mission, and operating the experiments. Nevertheless, the mapping
      radar carried on STS-2 and the space physics and solar instruments

      pallet (to the right). (NASA)</FONT></P>

      <P>The first true mission, Spacelab 1, was flown Nov. 28-Dec.
      8, 1983, aboard Space Shuttle Columbia. In a mission billed as
      &quot;science around the world and around the clock,&quot; the
      crew divided into two three-man shifts and worked almost continuously
      for 10 days. They grew the first protein crystals grown in space,
      scanned the chemical makeup of the atmosphere, measured radiation
      from the sun, and experimented with the behavior of fluids.</P>

      grew crystals that were larger and had more neatly ordered molecules

      <P>The implication was striking: without gravity's effects to

      deliberate effort to demonstrate its utility to all aspects of
      science, the next two Spacelab missions were dedicated to specific
      disciplines. Spacelab 3 (March 1985) carried an array of materials
      science experiments and atmospheric instruments. Spacelab 2 (July
      1985) carried instruments to study the sun, stars, and comic

      trouble. A laser that measured the changing position of key optics
      inside ATMOS developed a leak in its power supply. In a couple
      of days, the drop would allow electrical arcing that would short
      out ATMOS. The materials scientists agreed to defer many of their
      experiments so the Shuttle could maneuver and let ATMOS make

      <P>Three Spacelabs focused on how life adapts to and changes
      in space: two Space Life Sciences (SLS-1 and -2) and Neurolab,
      the last mission to use Spacelab hardware. The Life and Microgravity
      Sciences mission (LMS) combined both fields. Spacelab has also
      been pressed into service as a supply carrier with pallets carrying
      replacement parts to the Hubble Space Telescope and supplies
      for the Mir space station.</P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">W</FONT></B>ith NASA concentrating on preparations
      for International Space Station - including a wide array of materials,
      life sciences, and physics experiments - Spacelab was retired
      in 1998. While the Spacelab missions were highly successful,
      they did require a large effort on the part of NASA's science
      and engineering teams. The hardware is being distributed to space
      museums, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington,
      D.C.</P>

      <P>But it leaves a distinguished legacy. Lessons about how to
      conduct science in a demanding and dynamic environment are shaping
      research on Earth and on ISS. Spacelab has become one of Isaac
      Newton's &quot;shoulders of titans&quot; on which future space
      scientists will stand as they shape the 21st century.
