facilities for disabled visitors. The guide is probably the most complete

However, on match day's you will not be allowed within 
the vicinity of the ground unless you have a valid parking permit. 
</P><P>From the North:
Follow the A34 or M3 down until it meets the M27. At Eastleigh it splits off into two directions, one west bound the other 
east bound. It doesn't make a difference what exit you take as long as you get straight onto the A33 slip roads marked 
Southampton. Go down to the roundabout and straight over into the Upper Avenue. At the next roundabout, take the left hand 
exit (still the A33). Go down to the set of traffic lights and straight on down the Avenue for a mile. Southampton Common 
will be on your right hand side. At the next set of traffic lights (Stag Gates) carry straight on and get in the centre 
lane (the left hand lane turns off, as does the right hand lane) Carry straight on until you reach a big roundabout (with 
a car park in the middle - Charlotte Place) Take the 2nd exit on your left and stay in the left hand lane. This reaches the 
Six Dials junction and mass set of traffic lights. Visually, you should be able to see the top of the stadium white roof 
struts from here. They are to the right of the 2 gasometers and to the left of the tall grey and white block of flats. 
Carry straight on over 2 sets of traffic lights and onto the Northam Railway Bridge. The stadium is now fully visible on 
your right. Just over the bridge, turn right into Britannia Road.
</P><P>From the West:
On the M27, take the exit at Junction 3 and join up with the M271 south bound. Follow it for a mile down to the roundabout 
and get in the left hand lane to turn left (duh!). This joins up with the A35 and move over into the right hand lanes and 
go straight over next flyover and carry on down to the traffic lights. Go straight on, joining Mountbattan Way heading towards 
the City Centre. Get in the right hand lane at the next set of traffic lights (signposted for West Quay and Waterfront). 
Go over them to another set of lights and carry on West Quay Road (new shopping centre is on your left). Carry on over 2 
more lights until you get to a roundabout. Go straight across heading towards Town Quay with the Isle Of Wight Ferry 
Terminal on your right hand side. At the next set of light, go straight on and the road merges to one lane and hits a one 
way system. Follow it round the park and keep heading right and then quickly turn left into Canute Road. At the main set of 
traffic lights with Ocean Village on your right, turn left and up to the roundabout. The Itchen Toll Bridge is on your right. 
Go straight over the Roundabout into Albert Road North, this becomes Marine Parade and St Mary's is now right in front of 
you on the left.
</P><P>From the East:
On the M27, take the exit at Junction 7 and turn left onto the A334 (Charles Watts Way) Go down to the next roundabout and 
take the 2nd exit into Thornhill Park Road. After a mile this road becomes Bitterne Road East, but carry straight on for 
about 3 miles as the road then becomes Bitterne Road West. You will then go over the Northam Bridge with the Meridian TV 
Studios on your right. At the next set of traffic lights turn left into Prince's Street (Prince of Wales pub on corner) and
follow it round into Millbank St and straight on into Belvidere Road. St Mary's stadium is now right in front of you on the 
right hand side.
