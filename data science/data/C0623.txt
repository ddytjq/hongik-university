        Millions of holidaymakers are taking a big risk by failing to insure for 
        last-minute trips abroad, a new survey shows.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The research by NOP 
        for American Express suggests that 21 million British holidaymakers are 
        likely to book last-minute holidays abroad this year, and seven million 
        of them will travel without cover.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sarah Harper, head 
        of insurance services at American Express, warns against travelling without 
        insurance. She says: &#145;People booking last-minute holidays may be 
        eager to save money, but often overlook the fact that savings reaped by 
        booking late can be wasted if there are problems and they don&#146;t have 
        the right cover.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#145;Lost luggage 
        or an accident can prove costly without insurance.&#146;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Express reckons 
        that a broken leg in Spain would cost more than &pound;4,000 in medical 
        bills and an attack of food poisoning in France about &pound;200.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The firm argues that 
        annual insurance cover is best for spontaneous travellers because it removes 
        the problem of organising a policy at the last minute and saves money.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students who arrive 
        at college loaded down with the latest electronic equipment and little 
        local street wisdom are now the prime target for career burglars, according 
        to new home office research published yesterday. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study on burglary 
        prevention said that neighbourhoods dominated by students living in privately 
        rented flats and houses attracted criminals from across cities &quot;like 
        bees to a honeypot&quot;, drawn by the area's known poor security, poor 
        guardianship and rich pickings. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The research, which 
        was carried out as part of the government's crime reduction programme, 
        said that declining seaside towns and towns where the local property market 
        had collapsed, particulary in the north-west and north-east of England, 
        also suffered much higher than average burglary rates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students were now 
        among those most at risk because many lived in poorer and cheaper parts 
        of cities in privately rented property which was left empty for many hours 
        each day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They tend to 
        arrive at college or university with a supply of the most popular goods 
        taken in burglaries (readily portable, high value electronic equipment) 
        and little local street wisdom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It should be 
        no surprise that students experience high rates of burglary.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part of the problem 
        was the weak security inside many privately rented houses which had been 
        divided up to house several tenants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;twilight 
        world of bedsit land&quot; in seaside towns was also emerging as a national 
        burglary headache. Many resorts which had lost their tourist trade and 
        fallen on hard times now had burglary rates twice the national average. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In some northern towns 
        where housing demand had slumped and prices had fallen sharply, commercial 
        landlords rapidly bought up cheap property and moved in housing benefit 
        tenants, sparking the spiral of decline and high crime rates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Radburn estates&quot; 
        and &quot;neighbourhoods with rookeries&quot; - areas with well-established 
        networks of criminal families - continued to be a problem. The Radburn 
        layout of council estates, which were still being built, provided groups 
        of houses or flats approached by networks of footpaths separated by grassed 
        ares and with communal parking areas. The design &quot;continues to yield 
        its burglary harvest&quot; as the lack of natural surveillance, ease of 
        entry and ease of escape, contributed to high burglary rates.</font></p>
