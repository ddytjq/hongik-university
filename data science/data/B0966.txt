      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Applications will 
        only be accepted from personal investors resident in the United Kingdom. 
        Applications will not be accepted from non-UK residents, powers of attorney, 
        trustees and bodies corporate. The Society reserves the right not to accept 
        an application at its discretion.<br>
        <br>
        2. The minimum investment shall be &pound;5,000 and the maximum &pound;150,000. 
        If, for whatever reason, the balance falls below &pound;5,000 the Society 
        will close the account immediately and return the balance to the investor. 
        Interest will be paid up to the day before closure.<br>
        <br>
        3. Withdrawals may be made only by giving 90 days notice in writing. Cheques 
        withdrawn from an account cannot be stopped except in the case of loss 
        or theft.<br>
        <br>
        4. A passbook will be issued. This is required for all receipts and withdrawals. 
        Withdrawal requests sent by fax or electronic mail will not be accepted.<br>
        <br>
        5. Interest will be payable on 31st May annually and will be paid in accordance 
        with the investors' instructions.<br>
        <br>
        6. Rates of interest on these shares may vary from time to time. The Society 
        will only reduce the rate of interest for one or more of the following 
        reasons:<br>
        <br>
        (i) because the Society needs to reduce costs to enable it to reduce interest 
        rates payable to it by its current and new borrowers or otherwise to maintain 
        and develop the Society's lending business;<br>
        <br>
        (ii) because the Society's administrative costs and charges have increased 
        or the Society reasonably believes they are likely to do so in the near 
        future;<br>
        <br>
        (iii) because the cost to the Society of borrowing funds has increased 
        or the Society reasonably believes it is likely to do so in the near future;<br>
        <br>
        (iv) because the Society needs to reduce a rate or rates of interest payable 
        by it in order to achieve and maintain prudent levels of liquidity, profitability 
        and/or financial strength having regard to current economic circumstances 
        and the Society's expectations of future economic trends.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Any variation in 
        the interest rate will be publicised in the Society's offices, and will 
        be advertised in selected newspapers as advised in the leaflet Guide to 
        Savings.<br>
        <br>
        8. Any variation in the terms and conditions will be notified to the investor 
        giving not less than 120 days prior written notice of the variation.<br>
        <br>
        9. Any notification sent to an investor's correspondence address shall 
        be deemed to have been served 72 hours after having been posted.</font></p>
