&nbsp;
<P>International competition began in 1895 and men's field hockey first
appeared in the Olympics in London (1908), then again in Antwerp (1920)
and became a permanent fixture in the Games of 1928 in Amsterdam. The call
for more international matches led to the introduction of the World Cup
(1971) and some of the other major international tournaments include the
Asian Cup, Asian Games, European Cup, and Pan-American Games.&nbsp;

<P>India is the most powerful field hockey nation in Olympic history -
a fact which is not as unusual as one might think, since the sport there
is comparable to what college football is to the state of Nebraska (people
who follow American college football will understand this comparison).
Between 1928 and 1956, India won six gold medals and 30 consecutive games.
The streak ended in 1960 with a loss to Pakistan in the finals.&nbsp;
