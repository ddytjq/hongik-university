<h3><a name="Tip1">Creating your own layouts:</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the 5 layouts that come with the Java SDK, you
can create your own layouts. SunWorld Online has an example of a
new layout called the <a
href="http://www.Sun.COM:80/sunworldonline/swol-01-1996/swol-01-java.html"
target="_top">PackerLayout.</a> The PackerLayout provides a
geometry manager that arranges components by packing them around
the edges of the parent.</p>

<h3><a name="Question1">Things to check if you can't see the Java
applets: </a></h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Windows - </b>You need the 32 bit Netscape 2.0 browser
        to see Java Applets. Unfortunately, the 16 bit Netscape
        2.0 browser for Windows 3.1 does not support Java. If you
        were waiting for a reason to upgrade to Win95, now you've
        got one!</li>
    <li><b>Macintosh - </b>You need to download Netscape 2.0 Java
        beta 1 for the Macintosh (from Netscape) in order to run
        Java applets. Java was not supported yet when the Mac
        version of Netscape 2.0 first came out. </li>
    <li>If you're still reading, and your browser <b>still</b>
        won't display Java applets, check under the menus
        &quot;Options&quot; -&gt; &quot;Security&quot; and make
        sure that Java is not 'disabled'.</li>
    <li>If none of the above helped, or if you know of new
        information that I don't have here, send me an <a
        href="mailto:donc@fe3.rust.net"><b>e-mail</b></a> and
        I'll try to help you figure it out!</li>

<h3><a name="Question2"><img src="images/afraid.gif" width="29"
height="29"> Java Applet Security frustrations: </a></h3>

<p>Java Applets need to be secure so that rogue applets cannot
unleash viruses or perform other nasty operations on the
end-user's computer. Unfortunately, this is causing me much
frustration as I try to write useful Java Applets. </p>

<ul>
    <li>A Java Applet can't read or write files on the client,
        unless loaded via &quot;file loader&quot;. <explain> Netscape
        always loads applets via &quot;applet loader&quot;. I can
        definitely see why writing files to the client's computer
        needs to be restricted, but I think there needs to be
        some mechanism where trusted Applets can write to the
        client computer. It seems that Sun has provided this
        mechanism, but Netscape decided to prohibit it for the
        time being. Also speak about signatures to verify
        &quot;trusted applets&quot;</li>
    <li>A Java Applet can't open a network connection to any
        computer other than the host the applet originated from.</li>
    <li>A Java Applet can't maintain a persistent state. This
        means the applet dissappears when going to another web
        server/home page than the one that called it, and that
        the applet must be downloaded every time it is run,
        instead of only when it changes.<p>There are many
        discussions on comp.lang.java about the security
        limitations of applets. For client side file access, the
        consensus seems to be that Netscape and other Java client
        designers need to give the user the ability to allow
        limited local access throught he client's file access
        system. </p>
        <p>A simple implementation, discussed many times, is for
        the browser settings to include a yes/no option for file
        read/write to a single local directory. The user
        specifies the directory name and allows or prohibits
        applet access to that directory, as the user chooses from
        time to time. The installation default would be no access
        whatsoever. A finer grained implementation might permit
        the user to enable reading and writing separately, and
        perhaps even specify multiple directories rather than a
        single location. </p>
        <p>For more details on Java Applet security, see Sun's <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/sfaq/" target="_top">Java
        Security FAQ.</a> </p>
