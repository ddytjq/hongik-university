Berwick <BR></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Climbing Mount Improbable</FONT> <BR>Richard Dawkins <BR><I><FONT SIZE=+0>Norton, $25</FONT></I> <HR><FONT SIZE=+0>There is a strong urge to begin and end a review of RichardDawkins's most recent book about evolution at its title: <I>Climbing MountImprobable</I>. Dawkins's metaphorical mountain provides a handy picturepostcard for how he believes evolution by natural selection works, andalso locates his gene-centered pulpit (he calls his third chapter &quot;TheMessage from the Mountain&quot;). Regrettably though, <I>Climbing MountImprobable</I> does triple duty, characterizing the plausibility of Dawkins'sown ultra-Darwinian outlook. Evolution by natural selection is, to be sure,a firmly established part of contemporary science-like continental driftin geology, it's the explanatory bedrock for an entire field. But Dawkinsbelieves, further, that &quot;all questions about life have the same answer-naturalselection.&quot; Such fundamentalist faith oversimplifies the biologicalworld and obscures important questions about the forces driving evolution.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Adaptationism: The Uphill Climb</FONT> <BR></B><FONT SIZE=+0>Dawkins sets out on seemingly safe ground. We get thestock recipe: one part charmingly-written natural history; one part evolutionas the sole explanation for the &quot;goodness of apparent design&quot;;and a dash of selfish genes and &quot;biomorph programs&quot;-computeralgorithms simulating the evolution of forms from spider webs to centipedesegments-thrown in for spice. At heart, though, Dawkins's book rests onmid-century alpine imagery borrowed from evolutionary theorist Sewall Wright.Wright proposed a now-classic picture of evolution as organisms scramblinguphill in an &quot;adaptive landscape.&quot;</FONT> The terrain's heightcorresponds to fitness: organisms reach for better vision, fleeter feet,or, from a gene's-eye view, simply increased frequency of that particulargene over time. Dawkins adds to this picture assumptions about the preciselay of the land and how organisms scale slopes-intellectual inheritancefrom Darwin himself and the evolutionary theorist R.&nbsp;A. Fisher's <I>GeneticalTheory of Natural Selection</I> (1930)-to arrive at the &quot;the mainlesson&quot; of his book: that &quot;the evolutionary high ground cannotbe approached hastily. Even the most difficult problems can be solved,and even the most precipitous heights can be scaled, if only a slow, gradual,step-by-step pathway can be found.&quot; Though the exquisite designs ofstems, pistils, eyes, jaws, wings, gills, and tentacles may all seem improbable,we can understand them once we see how they emerged from a long seriesof tiny improvements. Broken down into three main mountaineering propositions,we have: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. &quot;[T]here can be no sudden leaps upward-no precipitousincreases in ordered complexity&quot; (insect wings can't jump from stubsto full-length flappers overnight).</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. There's no going downhill (species can't get worseas a prelude to getting better).</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>3. There may be &quot;more than one peak-more than oneway of solving the same problem&quot; (eyes, Dawkins explains, or at leasteye lens and &quot;camera body,&quot; have evolved independently 40 to60 times).</FONT> </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=+0>A world of creatures all driven by selectional pressures,inching upwards to their adaptive peaks-what's wrong with this picture?It's not immediately obvious. Although the metaphor of evolution-as-gradual-mountain-climbingis not fresh, it has endured. The notion of minute, step-by-step improvementdescends directly from the famous Linnaean dictum <I>Natura non facit saltum</I>and Darwin's <I>On the Origin of Species</I>: &quot;Extremely slight modificationsin the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantageover others.&quot; Evolutionary gradualism was further bolstered by R.&nbsp;A.Fisher's mathematical marriage of Mendelism to natural selection-the so-called&quot;neo-Darwinian Modern Synthesis.&quot; Fisher showed that, under some(strong) assumptions about population size and the underlying mechanismof inheritance, even slight selective advantages could be sifted by naturalselection and accumulate over time to weave the &quot;tangled bank&quot;of complex adaptations we see. Ever since, Wright's adaptive landscapehas been a staple of evolutionary texts, from Theodosius Dobzhansky's <I>Geneticsand the Origin of Species</I> (1937). Local hill-climbing does the trick-orso it seems. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>The problem, then, isn't vintage-it is fundamentalism.Perhaps like all fundamentalists, Dawkins over-simplifies: For all histalk of life's complexity, he makes the biological world out to be muchsimpler than it actually is. Left unchecked, this ultra-Darwinist faithin natural selection dissolves into a doctrinal irrationality that rivalsthat of creationism, with a ready answer for all logically possible outcomes.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=+0>The Constraining Terrain</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>One problem with paying exclusive attention to naturalselection is a corresponding inattention to physical constraints. If aninsect needs to clamber over an adaptive landscape, it's good to know whatpossible next steps it can take, and what the terrain just ahead lookslike-the &quot;physical channel&quot;. For example, many biological reactionstake place on cell membranes. Why? Because evolution by natural selectionmade it that way? That sounds like creationist litany, and for good reason.The real explanation probably follows from what Nobel laureate ManfredEigen dubs the &quot;coffee pot&quot; theorem: Membranes are required forthe same reason that people set up coffee pot stations-people cluster morereadily around them. Specifically, the limiting probability for two moleculesto meet in three dimensions is vanishingly small, but on a flat sheet-amembrane-the probability approaches near certainty. Thus life lingers ata coffee break.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Similarly, why do poliovirus shells resemble geodesicdomes? The answer isn't &quot;because evolution by natural selection madethem that way.&quot; The explanation, as molecular and developmental biologistSydney Brenner wrote recently, is fundamentally geometric. There are onlya handful of physically possible, symmetrical, space-enclosing shapes:pyramids, cubes and octahedrons, the pentagonal- faced dodecahedron (12pentagons glued together), and the pentagon's dual cousin, the icosahedron(20 equilateral triangles glued together). Plunk down a molecule on thecorner of each triangle, and one gets virus shells chunked into three-times-20or 60-unit multiples. From this inescapable fact of the physical world-itsgeometry, not the particular environment in which polioviruses evolved-JamesWatson and Francis Crick long ago predicted (correctly) that most sphericalvirus shells would come in 60-unit packages. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Of course it may be that natural selection plays somerole in shaping spherical virus shells. Icosahedrons approximate spheresmore closely than pyramids, so selectional factors like &quot;most nearlyspherical shape&quot; or &quot;optimal packing density&quot; might enterin. Possibly this is the sense in which virus forms are &quot;explainedby&quot; natural selection, if in fact they are. But even if so, it's acredit allocation question. Dawkins gives DNA pride of place because italone stores and passes on the informational know-how to make membranesrather than something else. That's partly true-but only partly. It's alsotrue that evolution, the &quot;blind watchmaker,&quot; stumbled onto membranesand icosahedrons because the physical world's regularity constrains thelandscape's &quot;search space,&quot; and through this regularity the physicalworld itself contributes to the information encoded in DNA.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Now, it would be a foolish biologist indeed who did notview adaptive evolution by natural selection as the unifying theory lurkingbehind the contrasting shape and texture of pine needles and oak leaves,as well as the peacock's tail. But it would be equally foolish to denythe constraints of living in the physical world. A decade ago, Dawkinsdevoted an entire chapter of his book <I>The Extended Phenotype</I> to&quot;constraints on perfection&quot;-engineering design tradeoffs that<I>Climbing Mount Improbable</I> still mentions but largely sets to oneside. In fact, all serious biologists, from Darwin to Dawkins, have agreedthat factors beyond natural selection play a central role in evolution.Just how central? Turn to the last line of the article &quot;Evolution&quot;in the latest edition of the <I>Encyclopedia Britannica</I>, written bythe population geneticist Francisco J. Ayala: &quot;as a point of departure&quot;and for good or for ill, today's working evolutionary biologists <I>start</I>with the &quot;null hypothesis&quot; that natural selection has <I>not</I>occurred. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>All Mutations Great and Small</FONT> <BR></B><FONT SIZE=+0>So why the renewed fundamentalism? Perhaps the answeris that Dawkins has now swallowed Darwin's and Fisher's gradualist assumptionswhole: add one extra layer of light-sensitive membrane, so the argumentgoes, and an eye's photon-trapping improves by a fractional percent-a smoothincline with no jumps or &quot;surprises.&quot;</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Though not literally true, this picture of a smoothlyadditive world might be a good enough idealization-sufficiently good thatevolutionary biologists could dismiss deviations as noise. But is the biologicalworld really so simple? An alternative picture-a <I>nonlinear</I> world-seemsto hold considerable promise. Though &quot;nonlinear&quot; is now a fashionableby-word, popping up in all those books about chaos and the stock market,it also marks out a serious approach to a wide range of natural phenomena.Certainly, when it comes to the electrical engineering side of my own profession,nonlinear circuits have replaced linear ones, and nonlinear dynamics isthe framework of choice for describing natural systems of all kinds-fromwater disappearing down a drain, to cirrus cloud formation, to grousesgrowing.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>What does nonlinearity imply for hill climbing? The linearalpine metaphor suggests that an insect scaling Mount Improbable can attainoptimal insecthood by independently pondering each factor that makes ita functioning, adaptive whole, even if the insect does this by sendingout multiple &quot;search teams&quot; across hill and down dale in parallel.But the success of this piece-wise strategy of self-improvement dependson a particularly simple connection between changes in individual traitsand improvements in fitness-essentially a noninteractive, nonecologicalworld.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Dawkins assumes just such a topography. His evolutionaryhills have gentle slopes, so that inching uphill always works. That followsFisher chapter and verse: picture each gene that contributes to bettereyesight as if it were one of millions upon millions of fine sand grains.Piling up all that sand automatically produces a neatly conical sand pilewith just one peak, a smooth mound to climb. In this way, complex adaptationssuch as the eye can always come about via a sequence of extremely small,additive changes to their individual parts, each change selectively advantageousand so seized on by natural selection.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>The key question is whether the biological world reallyworks that way, or rather, how <I>often </I>it works that way. And thatquestion divides into two parts. Theoretically speaking: what works betteras the raw material or &quot;step size&quot; for adaptation-countless geneseach contributing a tiny effect, or a handful of genes of intermediateor large effect? Empirically speaking: how does adaptation really playout in the biological world? Are large mutations really always harmful,as Fisher argued? Do organisms usually tiptoe in the adaptive landscapeor take larger strides? Are adaptive landscapes usually smooth sand piles,jagged alpine ranges, or something in between? </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Fisher addressed the theoretical question via a mathematicalversion of the &quot;monkey wrench&quot; argument: A large mutation wouldbe much more likely than a small one to gum up the works of a complex,finely-constructed instrument like a microscope. It's not hard to see why.Once one is at a mountain top, a large step is much more likely to leadto free-fall disaster. But the microscope analogy can easily mislead. Fisher'sexample considers a mutation's potential benefits in a particularly simplesetting-precisely where there is just one mountain top, and in an infinitepopulation. But if I'm astride K90 with Mt. Everest just off to the left,then a large step might do better to carry me towards the higher peak thana small one. The more an adaptive landscape resembles the Himalayas, withpeaks crowded together-a likely consequence of developmental interactions,which crumple the adaptive landscape, as we'll see-the worse for Fisher'sanalogy. Small wonder then that Dawkins's topographic maps and the gradualevolutionary computer simulations he invokes constantly alter how mountainheights get measured, resorting to a single factor-first for eyes, it'svisual resolution; next, for spider webs, it's insect-trapping effectiveness;then, for insect wings, it's aerodynamic lift or temperature-regulatingability. An appropriate move, since hill-climbing is guaranteed to workonly if there's exactly one peak and one proxy for fitness that can beoptimized, one dimension at a time.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Even assuming a single adaptive peak, Fisher's microscopeanalogy focuses on only half the evolutionary equation-variation in individuals,essentially the jet fuel that evolution burns-and not the other half-theselective engine that sifts variations and determines which remain writtenin the book of life. Some 50 years after Fisher, the population biologistMotoo Kimura noted that most mutations of small effect do not last: Becausesmall changes are only slightly selectively advantageous, they tend topeter out within a few generations (ten or so). Indeed, most mutations,great or small, advantageous or not, go extinct-a fact often brushed asideby selectional enthusiasts. Kimura calculated that the rate at which amutation gains a foothold and then sweeps through a population is directlyproportional to the joint effect of the probability that the mutation isadvantageous <I>and</I> the mutation's size.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT>The upshot is that medium-scale mutations are much more likely to takehold than minuscule Fisherian sand grains. Moreover, even if medium-scalechanges were less likely to fix in a population than &quot;micromutations,&quot;by definition a larger change will contribute correspondingly more to anorganism's overall response to natural selection than a small one and,as we will see, there's real evidence from fruitflies that this happens.<FONT SIZE=-2>3</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>What then of the empirical issue? Four years ago, theevolutionary biologists Allen Orr and Jerry Coyne found that the geneticevidence for the role of micromutations as the source of adaptive differencesbetween species, such as color differences in fruitflies in desert environments,was surprisingly thin-in the handful of verifiable examples (eight) drawnfrom the 1940s on, which easily fit into a single half-page table in theiroriginal paper, four were due to essentially one gene.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>4</FONT>More recently, biologists have gathered evidence that mutations with medium-to large-scale effects occur and, far from always being harmful as Fisherasserted, can even play an important, beneficial role. For instance, fruitflyresistance to certain insecticides seems to be caused by the alterationof a single &quot;letter&quot; in the DNA sequence of a single gene. Evenfor more quantitative or countable traits that have often been taken asthe natural province of Fisher's additive-type model-lots of genes withsmall effects piling up-recent evidence suggests the contrary. Considerthe bristle hairs on a fruitfly's abdomen-a fairly sophisticated part ofthe fly's sensory system, and often taken as a &quot;classic&quot; exampleof a quantitative trait. In 1995, Anthony Long, Susan Mulaney, Trudy Mackay,and their colleagues showed that the number of abdominal hairs is largelydetermined by just one to three genes, not dozens or hundreds.<FONT SIZE=-2>5</FONT>Moreover, the effects don't simply add up: if one factor contributes anaverage of 2 bristle hairs by itself, and another pitches in two more,an additive model would predict four hairs on average, but the two factorstogether produce roughly six. </P><P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Interactions</FONT> <BR></B><FONT SIZE=+0>All this is not to say that such intricate and highlyfunctional organs as eyes could emerge in one giant mutational leap, likeAthena springing forth from Zeus's forehead on the slopes of Mount Olympus.That seems exceedingly unlikely. But the troubles for small mutations indicateone major stumbling block for Dawkins's hill-climbing metaphor. So, too,do interactions among traits. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>We all know how hard it can be to solve a problem thatdepends on lots of interacting parts: Imagine trying to tune a televisionpicture by simultaneously twiddling a million knobs at once. Evolution'sin the same boat. A trait may appear to have an intermediate optimum becauseit's correlated with other traits that affect fitness in opposite directions,as in the classic example of body size: A bigger body yields more offspring,but makes it harder to escape predators. Tradeoffs again-but how to &quot;solve&quot;them?</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Worse for aspiring alpinists, the biological world mightnot be pleasantly additive. Suppose ecological interaction rules: moreanteaters mean fewer ants. Then trying to improve the whole organism byimproving one trait at a time can grind to a halt and the organism's fitnessmay not be maximized. Stumbles become inevitable, as Dawkins rightly stresses:&quot;ideal outcomes are not the only possibility.&quot; But the situationis worse than that. Fitness can even be minimized by natural selection-asour crumbling spines attest. Evolution by natural selection in a finitepopulation can result in a <I>decreased</I> growth rate, and in some ecologicalsettings lead to a <I>higher</I> probability of extinction-about as nonadaptiveas one could imagine. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>History and Evolutionary Tides</FONT> <BR></B><FONT SIZE=+0>Bad backs are not, then, simply some quirky evolutionaryoffshoot. Rather, in the real world-with natural selection and physicalconstraints, in which large mutations sometimes dominate small, and improvementsdepend on lots of interacting factors-nonadaptation itself is a centralingredient in the evolution's ebb and flow. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is all too easy to fall under the sway of natural selectionas Supreme Engineer, because it is a retrospective tautology that &quot;themechanisms of evolution have, indeed, produced every result that has appearedin evolution.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>6</FONT> Evidently, even Darwinwas susceptible. As many others have observed, far from purging the lastvestige of the anthropocentric Great Chain of Being, Darwin can be readas retaining (a perhaps Victorian) &quot;progressive,&quot; perfectionist&quot;residue, as he reveals in his autobiography: &quot;Believing as I do thatman in the distant future will be a more perfect creature than he is now.&quot;<FONT SIZE=-2>7</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0>So the perfectionist pyramid lives on-not only in those whoperpetually appeal to natural selection as Supreme Engineer, but also inthose who believe that, yes, if we rewound the evolutionary tape and playedit all over again, we would end up about where we are now, with intelligentcreatures like us to boot. Such unwavering faith reveals a misunderstandingabout the essentially stochastic and historical nature of evolutionarychange. For evolution, small and medium-size numbers matter-because ofthe slings and arrows of outrageous sampling. By Mendel's &quot;laws,&quot;the genes for, say, completely dominant brown (B) and recessive blue eyes(b) should segregate out into exactly four offspring as three brown (1BB, 2 Bb) and one blue (bb). But as all parents know, it's a pure strokeof luck for that to happen with just four children. (Even Mendel's 929pea plants had 705 purple and 224 white flowers, a 3.15:1 ratio, not theexact 3:1 ratio predicted by theory.) Because organisms often have thiskind of detailed structure, with differing groups of grouses at differentages, fluctuations in age-specific birth and death rates lead to enoughvariation in population numbers so that the likelihood of new mutationstaking over varies in a probabilistic way. The bottom line is that if werun the evolutionary tape again, we aren't going to get the same &quot;perfection&quot;we see now-that is, not unless one adopts very strong constraints on thespace of possible animals that, as far as we know from this book, Dawkinsexplicitly disavows.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>So historical contingency matters-we've got four limbsbecause we're descended from four-lobed Crossopterygiian fish and evolutioncan select only the better of possible alternatives-no silk purses fromsow's ears. Evolution is much like a chess game where the next move dependson the possible legal next moves-the biological and physical constraintslike icosahedron-as well as the position one is at right now, summarizingthe moves made up to the present. But evolution is in worse shape thana chess player, because the &quot;search strategy&quot; for the best nextmove is local hill climbing without a goal-we don't have a teleologicaltarget like checkmate. Because gradual hill-climbing evolution by naturalselection can ascend only to local peaks, and since evolution can't seeahead, and according to Dawkins, evolution can't ever climb down again,our ant might climb up on a foothill and stay stuck. Indeed, if evolutionwere really just one smooth, additive hike to a single fitness peak, wemight expect, echoing the Cole Porter song &quot;You're the Top,&quot;to see just one organism stand supreme as the Tower of Pisa. We do not.Rather, evolution's more like an ant trundling over a crumpled piece ofpaper, with the nooks and crannies revealing where the possible animalscan be. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>The bottom line is that mathematical evolutionary biologistsas yet don't have any good general solutions to such nonlinear problems-andthey unabashedly say so. According to Alan Hastings and Gordon Fox, &quot;theequations of population genetics are complicated nonlinear equations, andtherefore general solutions, particularly of dynamic behavior [of evolution]have not been found.&quot; Dawkins provides no such cautionary road signs.We are treated to much less catholicism and certainly much less of the&quot;controversy and uncertainty&quot; that ought to figure, as Dawkins'smentor John Maynard Smith has written, in the best science writing. InsteadDawkins's faith in simple hill-climbing seems boundless-as it must if oneembraces adaptation-as-problem solving and incremental hill-climbing asthe only means to tackle evolutionary design questions. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Genes or Organisms?</FONT> <BR></B><FONT SIZE=+0>The same lack of sophistication-ultimately fundamentalism-infectsDawkins's (in)famous selfish-gene conceit: that genes &quot;manipulatethe world for their replication.&quot; For Dawkins, genes drive the explanatoryshow. He even calls organisms &quot;vehicles&quot;-an old conceit thatleads us straight back to origins of 20th century genetics. By 1926, thegeneticist H.&nbsp;J. Muller could write that the rest of the cell wassimply a &quot;by-product&quot; of gene action: &quot;its 'function' (itssurvival value) lies only in fostering the genes.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>8</FONT>This conceit also simplifies the evolutionary climb. The more direct theconnection between gene and organism, the easier for the gene to &quot;drive&quot;the vehicle-the organism. </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Here again Dawkins oversimplifies. Not that his view iscompletely off. Usually, one can think about evolution &quot;one gene ata time,&quot; as John Maynard Smith, following R.&nbsp;A. Fisher, has written.A gene only has to worry about how it contributes to &quot;average fitness&quot;-itsown frequency-and can ignore its neighbors'. And averages are additive.But it doesn't follow that we can talk as if organisms weren't there, andas if all genes were individually selfish. Genes' causal fingers touchthe world only indirectly through organisms' walls. The further we moveout into the world of interacting organisms, the more our adaptive explanationsget couched as differences among organisms, not genes. True, genes benefitand get implicated in organisms' success, but genes don't necessarily figurein our explanation of why things are they way they are. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Take one of Dawkins's own <I>Mount Improbable</I> successstories: insect wing evolution. Do we need mention &quot;gene&quot; toexplain why stubby-winged insects produced more offspring than winglessvarieties? No. Only the ecological description of organism and environmentis required. The wing stubs were adaptations for the good of the insect,the genes benefited indirectly. Of course DNA is necessary for evolutionby natural selection; it's just not always an equal partner in explanation.Dawkins recounts how Joel Kingsolver and Mimi Koehl built hypotheticalinsect models to test whether and when wing stubs could develop enoughlift to get off the ground, but genes were not part of this picture andnot part of their counterfactual predictions about the improvements inflight that would result from 1 millimeter changes in wing size. You canapply the test yourself when you read Dawkins's book: he opens and closeswith the ever-fascinating story of the co-evolution of figs and fig wasps,adapted from evolutionary biologist W.&nbsp;D. Hamilton's 1975-76 fieldwork in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. The figs &quot;yearn&quot; for pollination;the fig wasps oblige, and themselves go through an elaborate competitionto see which male wasps will get there &quot;fastest with the mostest&quot;to mate inside the fig-killing already-arrived males and mated femalesif they can and pollinating the fig as a side-effect. To be sure, the endresult promotes both a fig and fig wasp's genome. But, if the explanationsand predictions about how figs and wasps have adapted rely on featuresof whole figs and wasps, then the organisms are the players; if, on theother hand, the story is told in terms of genes that happen to coexistalongside other genes in figs and wasps, then we don't need the organismsfor the explanation and the explanatory game goes the other way.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Of course in some environments DNA does get directly selectedwithout an intervening body getting in the way-most obviously in the environmentsof other genes. Not surprisingly, that's precisely where we do see evidenceof &quot;selfish DNA&quot; that, like a virus, says only &quot;copy me,&quot;and does not benefit the organism itself.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>As to whether DNA drives the biological show-as opposedto the entire cell with its internal &quot;skeleton&quot; that serves asscaffolding and meeting place, organelles, and detailed exterior &quot;cortex&quot;-historyagain has some lessons for us. Dawkins's position belongs to a long tradition,extending from the 1920s-era enthusiasm for genes as ultimate choreographersand active &quot;agents,&quot; to physicist Erin Schr&ouml;edinger's famous1944 &quot;What Is Life?&quot; proclamation that the chromosome contains&quot;architect's plan and builder's craft in one,&quot; to molecular biology'scybernetic lingo and triumph in the 1960s, to the 1980s view of the geneas &quot;computer program&quot; (or, as David Baltimore put it in 1984,the &quot;cell's brain&quot;). But much has changed over the past ten years.The deeper the biologists plumb DNA and replace the tell-tale words &quot;geneaction&quot; with &quot;gene activity,&quot; the further the image of DNA-as-agentseems to recede-so much so that by 1991, even <I>Scientific American</I>announced the &quot;news&quot; that &quot;organisms control most of theirgenes.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>9</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus &quot;vulgar biology&quot; appears to be turned onits head: DNA is not self-replicating; only cells are properly self-replicating.As Richard Lewontin has pointed out, newly-minted DNA is &quot;a copy ofthe old . . . but we do not describe the Eastman Kodak factory as a placeof self-reproduction [of photographs].&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>10</FONT>DNA doesn't produce proteins; proteins produce DNA. And the complete DNAin the nucleus of a cell, its genome, isn't a program for &quot;computingthe organism.&quot; Some now dub DNA simply the &quot;data&quot; that thecell uses. For even a computer program needs a computer to run it, butunlike a computer program, a genome doesn't contain all the informationabout the required sequence and timing of steps. Moreover, even a computerprogram requires particular hardware and software to <I>interpret</I> whatthe program code means, and that means supplying extra information. Andwhat might that interpreter be? The most recent edition of the popularAlberts-Watson textbook <I>Molecular Biology of the Cell</I> names-youguessed it-the heroine of its title, the cell, as the computer. </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>If you still believe that DNA carries all the requisiteinstructions to build organisms, consider Gunter Stent's gedanken experiment:Ship a cat's DNA to the planet supposedly circling Pegasi 51 and see whetherthe creatures on the other end can grind out a Felix. Not a chance. Or,to take a real example, consider biologist Frank Solomon's discovery of&quot;mitotic sisters&quot;: Take two &quot;mother&quot; developing neuralcells sitting next to each other, each looking very much the same. Bothcells obviously have identical genes, and are sitting in virtually theidentical external soup. The first cell divides, yielding two sisters witha particular shape-a long extension fiber down and then a short twist tothe right. The second mother cell divides and its offspring look very differentfrom the first two, with short nerve fibers. Each pair of sisters is shapedcompletely differently from its genetically identical neighbors. Genesdon't fix the &quot;surface&quot; traits of organisms-except in conjunctionwith a complex, nonlinear waltz of external and internal cellular positions,chemical gradients, and signaling environments.</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+0>Thesenonlinearities in moving from DNA sequences to organisms wrinkle the evolutionarylandscape even more. As Howard Patee memorably remarked, &quot;life loitersover two . . . spaces, the first alphabetic [DNA, the genetic code], thesecond, zoological.&quot; We don't know-yet-what this mapping from genesto bodies looks like. We are just beginning to tease apart the cascadedgenetic control sequences and feedback loops needed to assemble a fruitfly'seye. Yet it is absolutely crucial for evolutionary theory to understandthe possible range of organisms that can spring from the platform of adeveloping egg. If turning the genetic steering wheel one degree left canjerk the vehicle into a new pothole, the evolutionary process becomes evenmore nonadditive.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>To appreciate the complexity of moving from genes to organisms,consider first the space of possible genes. Genes are DNA sequences, andDNA uses a finite coding &quot;alphabet&quot; of just four letters (aminoacids) with the tags A, T, G, C, and a small number of words with exactly3 letters each (for example, ATG or AGC). DNA sequences are just stringsof such words. This space is effectively infinite, then, because one couldsimply go on forever, building longer and longer &quot;sentences&quot;-biggerand bigger genes-though physical limits intervene to bar indefinitely longsequences. Still, the set of possible DNA sequences is countable: We canpair each sequence with a unique integer: 1, 2, 3, etc.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>We know far less about the space of possible organisms-whatDawkins calls &quot;Animal Space.&quot; But if we take literally Darwin'sclaim that variation &quot;extends <I>continuously</I> [my emphasis] inall directions,&quot; then this space is infinite too, but bigger thanthe merely countable infinity of possible genes. For every inch long worm,there can be one half as long, another half again as long, and so on, withgradations as fine as we wish. But that means the space of possible organismsmay not be computable-that is, a computer program might not be able tocalculate it. <I>A fortiori</I>, the function from genes to organisms thatrepresents developmental transformation-what biologists call &quot;epigenesis&quot;-maynot be computable. There may be no algorithm to characterize epigenesis.Statements trumpeting the self-evidence of computability-Dawkins says &quot;weare von Neumann machines&quot;-are sheer bluff. We might be. We might not.It is an open question.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Dawkins does take a step in the right (nonlinear) directionin this respect. In the chapter &quot;Kaleidoscopic Embryos,&quot; he optsfor a gene-to-organism mapping that multiplies &quot;gene&quot; valuestogether-reaching, as he says, for a model that works like a kaleidoscope.Gene effects can twist about like bits of glass and then suddenly jumptogether into a novel pattern, like an eye cup bending in instead of out.This is probably closer to the real picture than the &quot;additive&quot;model. But once we allow for such &quot;jumps,&quot; we leave smooth hillclimbing behind. Indeed, we know that kaleidoscopic jumps must happen,because very small differences between organisms' genes can get amplifiedinto very large differences in what comes out of the embryological oven.Chimps, for example, differ from people by a very tiny amount of DNA, say1 percent, and in surprising direction: chimps have forty-eight chromosomesand we have forty-six. But only you and I can read this issue of <I>BostonReview</I>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>11</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+0>Having embracedthe kaleidoscope, does Dawkins now agree with Richard Lewontin that &quot;contextand interaction are of the essence&quot;?</FONT> </P><P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Yes, But . . .</FONT> <BR></B><FONT SIZE=+0>In the end, it is hard to tell where Dawkins comes out.Once all the complications are at hand, Dawkins begins to resemble CaptainCorcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore, singing, &quot;What never, well É hardly ever.&quot;One by one he backs off from his original alpinist assumptions.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Can there be only infinitesimally graded intermediates?Perhaps not. We also have kaleidoscopic&quot; embryos. But especially notif physical possibilities are discontinuous, like the geometric shapesavailable to spherical virus shells.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Does evolution never step downhill? Well, hardly ever.Dawkins tinkers with another of Sewall Wright's innovations, the famous&quot;shifting balance&quot; model, which one might caricature as clumpinguphill with one's weight first on the left foot and then rocking back ontothe right foot. The two feet correspond to two local, but distinct, populations,what Wright called &quot;demes.&quot; If one gets stuck on a local foothillwith the right foot, then it might be possible to rock back onto the leftfoot and continue uphill.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Can evolution of traits stall at the top of local foothills?Sometimes. So Dawkins adopts &quot;preadaptation.&quot; The insect wingmodels suggest that the first insect wing stubs probably served as bodytemperature regulators, rather than flying wings, given the insects' smallersize; only later, after a burst in overall body size, could the wings developenough lift. Dawkins concludes this &quot;teaches us a subtle new way,a kind of sideways diversion, by which paths up Mount Improbable may befound.&quot; In other words, the familiar story that an organ developedfor one purpose may later serve another.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Were eyes independently invented more than 40 times? Possiblyonly once. The larger number tallies distinct lens-and-retina shapes, notthe basic light-processing machinery-a big difference, like counting thecamera lens and body but not the film. For as Dawkins himself writes, WalterGerhing has shown that eye photoprocessing apparently evolved just onceand stayed that way, right down to the finest molecular detail-the &quot;film&quot;biochemistry, the structural and regulatory genes, even the molecular &quot;chaperones&quot;that escort other proteins to erect the right &quot;external scaffolding&quot;to build the photoreceptive machinery. From owls to the single-celled <I>Euglenagracillis</I> with a carrot-colored eye spot: All this has been conserved,seemingly back to the very first single-celled organisms that could seethe light. If so, then eye evolution seems more like a automotive redesignthat changes the chrome on the body, while leaving the engine untouched.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=+0>Indeed, it has become increasingly apparent that all organismsalso come equipped with roughly the same developmental tool kit that literallybuilds us from stem to stern and front to back. This control system, asequence of genes that activates in a precise linear order, fixes the head-to-tailorientation of growing embryos, and (like the eye developmental system)probably evolved exactly once, prior to the last common ancestor of fliesand vertebrates, a half-billion years ago or more, and then stayed thatway. Same for front to back: When the 19th-century biologist Etienne Geoffrey-SaintHillaire flipped over a crayfish and dissected it, he discovered that itsnerve cord, muscle, digestive system, and heart were in the same top-to-bottomorder as a human being's. Thus we have the same body plan as a crayfish,but inverted: one vertebrate's ceiling is another invertebrate's floor,and the reason why is a common genetic developmental system. A great puzzleof modern biology is how to reconcile the remarkable diversity of organismswe see with the equally astonishing conservatism of the genetic developmentaltoolbox: as if there really were only one organism, as if little kids werereally made of snakes and snails and puppy dog tails. The oft-castigatedB&auml;uplane theorists of the past century perhaps guessed rightly-butin a far more sophisticated way, within the context of modern molecularbiology. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>With all these qualifications in mind, ponder Dawkins'scentral evolutionary pledge and judge whether it reduces to a truism: &quot;[I]fan engineer looks at an animal or organ and sees that it is well designedto perform some task, then I will stand up and assert that natural selectionis responsible for the goodness of apparent design. 'Magnets' or 'attractors'in Animal Space cannot, <I>unaided by selection</I> [my emphasis], achievegood functional design.&quot;</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>Even if we put to one side the tangles we've seen with&quot;responsible for&quot; and &quot;good functional design,&quot; with&quot;unaided by selection&quot; as an escape clause, it is hard to seewhat this pledge amounts to. Along with any other rational person, I assumethat no living thing has come into the world &quot;unaided by selection.&quot;I can't understand a word that you say &quot;unaided by&quot; my innerear bones, which evolved from a fish gill arch to a reptilian jaw residue.But that doesn't mean my inner ear bones are &quot;responsible for&quot;sentence understanding.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>What, then, of Dawkins and his met-aphorical mountain?The scope and operation of evolution by natural selection remains a matterof controversy. And when controversy emerges, Dawkins frustrates. As Dawkinshimself notes in his earlier work <I>The Extended Phenotype</I>, &quot;Imyself admit to being irritated by a book that provokes me into muttering'Yes but . . . ' on every page, when the author could easily have forestalledmy worry by a little considerate explanation early on.&quot; In <I>ClimbingMount Improbable</I> Dawkins seems to have abandoned his own advice. The&quot;yes-buttery&quot; that he had so artfully condemned slips in at everypage.</FONT> </P><P><FONT SIZE=+0>So read <I>Climbing Mount Improbable</I> for charmingnatural history, and an introduction to evolutionary landscapes. But bewarethe slippery slopes. &quot;Charm,&quot; as Anthony Blanche in <I>BridesheadRevisited</I> reminds us, &quot;is the great English blight.&quot; Thequestion is whether Dawkins, like the narrator Charles Ryder in <I>Brideshead</I>,will forever remain repainting pictures of English village architectureand South American birds, or will go on to do something much more-feelingfor the organism. </FONT><FONT FACE="Zapf Dingbats"><FONT SIZE=-1>n</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#808080">Originally published in the December 1996/ January 1997 issue of Boston Review</FONT></CENTER></P><STYLE><!--A.menu {text-decoration: none}--></STYLE> 	<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="585">		<TR HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="MIDDLE">				<TD HEIGHT="36" COLSPAN="2" NOWRAP ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="MIDDLE">				<BR><HR><BR>				<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#808080">Copyright <A HREF="mailto:bostonreview@mit.edu">Boston Review</A>, 1993-2000.
