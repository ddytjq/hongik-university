<b>Cyber-Sleuths</b><br><br>
<p>
Imagine how difficult it would be to track down a killer if he or she constantly
changed form, if with each person he struck, he took on new characteristics.
That's the nature of the deadly HIV virus, and to confront that chameleon-like
quality, a handful of elite scientists have been charged with computer mapping
HIV DNA in its many disguises. Now, with the mapping process in place, the courts
have begun to call on these scientists to help them decipher HIV DNA evidence for
actual murder trials.
</p>
<p>
SFI visiting faculty member Better Korber is one of those scientists. While she
generally spends her days examining the lines of letters which represent HIV DNA,
rarely has she met the actual people who carry the virus. Until now.
</p>

<p>
"I generally get to know the HIV viruses I study quite intimately, but as strings
of letters. So initially, DM and JT didn't represent people," she says, speaking
straight and easy, her large brown eyes betraying sadness.
</p>
<p>
"Rather their initials represented viral sequence IDs. It was odd to see the
people behind the virus for once, to see Donald (DM) and Janice (JT) in person,
and hear their stories."
</p>
<p>
Donald and Janice were key players in a murder-mystery-like drama that played out
recently in Lafayette, Louisiana. The young woman, Janice Trahan Allen, who is
infected with HIV and Hepatitis C, accused her former lover, a doctor, of
purposefully injecting her with a mixture of blood from two of his patients, one
infected with HIV and the other with Hepatitis C. The accused, Dr. Richard
Schmidt, denied the allegation. Korber testified as a witness for the defense.
</p>
<p>
"Janice wept frequently when she was present during the trial and fainted when
the verdict was read," says Korber of the victim. "The feelings in the courtroom
were powerful and intense, and the situation was tragic."
</p>
<p>
Korber and her colleagues were charged with examining the sequences of letters
which represent the virus that is in the process of killing Janice Trahan Allen,
and determining whether, in its mutable way, it was closely enough related to the
doctor's patient's HIV to mean the doctor had actually committed this crime. This
was the first time in the U.S. that HIV DNA evidence was used in a criminal case,
and Korber is certain that it won't be the last.
</p>

<b>Who-Done-It</b><br><br>
<p>
Korber examines what are called phylogenetic trees, similar conceptually to
family trees or genealogies, but these maps are based on genetic sequence
relationships of HIV. They can be compared to determine whether or not the virus
found in one individual is closely linked to the virus found in another. Viruses
from individuals who transmit directly from one to the other will generally have
sequences that are more similar to each other than viruses from other unrelated
individuals. These sequences are compared though "phylogenetic analysis." Though
this seems an obscure form of science, the legal applications are becoming more
and more broad.
</p>
<p>
In one case, the Centers for Disease Control sought the expertise of Korber and
her Los Alamos National Laboratory colleague Gerald Myers in a public health
study that was the basis for a civil suit in Florida. Five people were thought to
be infected with HIV during invasive dental procedures. "The sequences of those
patients were extremely close to the sequence of the HIV-infected dentist in that
study, and at least two of the five patients had virtually no other risk factor
for infection," Korber says. That lawsuit was directed not at the dentist, but at
the HMOs that referred the patients to him. After the death of the dentist, the
case was settled out of court.
</p>
<p><img src="images/korber.gif" align=left width="200" height="208" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Korber sees the potential for other legal applications of HIV sequence analysis
arising. In New York, a man who is HIV positive is suspected of infecting a
number of women; he knew his HIV status and failed to inform his lovers.  HIV DNA
sequence analysis combined with epidemiological data could scientifically
pinpoint him as the culprit.
</p>
<p>
The legal implications of this scenario, if it ultimately reaches the courts, are
unclear. "But it would be a precedent-setting case," Korber says. "For a person
to be HIV positive and not tell his lovers-if it's that deliberate, could it be
considered attempted murder?"
</p>
<p>
In another recent case, a man was found guilty of injecting his child with HIV in
order to avoid child care payments. While this case did not involve HIV sequence
analysis, others like it could.
</p>
<p>
Still another type of case Korber describes seems stranger than fiction: an
HIV-infected intravenous drug user robbing people at needle point. Rather than
threatening them with a gun, the desperate person holds up a needle filled with
his or her own contaminated blood. If the victim were infected in such a case,
the sequencing could help prove scientifically that the infection came from the
thief. This kind of molecular DNA evidence could also be used in rape cases, to
help identify a rapist.
</p>

<b>Blurry Clues</b><br><br>
<p>
However, as Korber and the courts found in the Lafayette case, the answers the
sequencing analysis provides aren't always clear cut. In that case, the
prosecution sequenced the HIV DNA from the victim, Janice Trahan Allen.
Scientists compared her viral sequences to those of a man named Donald
McClelland, who had been a patient of the accused, Dr. Schmidt.  The prosecution
held that the doctor had withdrawn blood from McClelland and injected it into
Allen. If this were the case, one would think that Allen's and McClelland's HIV
sequences would be very similar. Indeed those sequences were more closely related
to each other than to any of the control group sequences (viral sequences from
HIV positive individuals who live around Lafayette). The prosecution based part
of their case on this observation, which Korber confirmed.</font></small>
</p>

<p><font face="helvetica, sans serif, arial"><small>
"However, the relationships in the HIV envelope gene sequences, one of the two
HIV genes that were sequenced from Allen and McClelland, were distant for a
recent transmission event," says Korber. She worked on this case with James
Mullins and Gerald Learn of the University of Washington, and William Gallaher of
the Louisiana State University Medical Center, all experienced HIV researchers.
In their collective experience, and in published HIV transmission studies in the
scientific literature, they could not find examples of such divergent sequences
coming from two people who had recently transmitted virus from one to the other.
</p>
<p>
Viral envelope sequences are estimated to diverge on average about 1% per year,
yet Allen's and McClelland's were on average 6.9% apart only 13 months after the
day Allen says she was infected, and none of the envelope sequences obtained from
the two individuals were very close.  Korber has found studies that include
sequences from individuals who are highly unlikely to be directly related, but
who carry viruses that are as closely related as Allen's and McClelland's. This
raised many questions for Korber and Mullins, including questions about the
timing of infection of the individuals used for the Lafayette control group.
</p>
<p>
Time is critical when working with a virus that is mutating as rapidly as is HIV.
"Within each person it's evolving so fast that you can even see variation
accumulating during the course of that person's infection," says Korber. Contrast
this to human DNA sequencing-often used in court cases-and you have a whole
different character.
</p>
<p>
When courts use human DNA to prove that someone committed a crime, all they need
is, say, a bit of hair. The hair's DNA sequence will be identical to the sequence
in the person who lost the hair. In the case of HIV, however, in a short period
of time, the virus will have evolved, and as more time passes, it may look very
different from the original sequence with which the person was infected.
</p>

<b>Removing Escape Routes</b><br><br>
<p>
The complexity of working with human DNA led the National Academy of Sciences to
publish books in 1992 (DNA Technology in Forensic Science) and again in 1996 (The
Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence), which have aided the courts and
organizations such as the FBI in their use of such evidence. Both publications
were funded by the Department of Justice and the FBI. Korber believes that
similar guidelines are needed for viral DNA forensics, and they need to be
drafted fast.
</p>
<p>
First, Korber believes that care must be taken when working with the HIV samples.
Above all, the experimental steps should be performed separately for the cases in
question, to avoid sample mixup and potential contamination problems. The
procedures should be done in duplicate, preferably in two different laboratories.
But if that is not possible, they should be performed at least at different
times. The person conducting the experiment should be "blinded," which means that
when the samples are processed they are coded so it is not obvious during the
experiment which are the most interesting samples, and which are the controls.
</p>
<p>
In the Lafayette case, there was some question about the validity of the
sequences which were used during the pre-trial hearing. Both the patient's and
the victim's samples were handled in the same laboratory, apparently
side-by-side, and some of the local control sequences were found to be
contaminations of a common laboratory strain of HIV.  Due to this, limited
confirmatory sequencing was conducted in a second laboratory prior to the trial,
but more testing would have been desirable. "Contamination is very easy with
HIV," says Korber. "It happens even in the best labs, and every precaution must
be taken."
</p>
<p>
There should also be guidelines for selecting control samples, Korber believes.
In a case like the one in Lafayette, scientists need to be sure that the controls
against which they're comparing the litigated cases are from an appropriate risk
group and with appropriate timing. If such controls are not available, then they
need to be aware of the limitations of their study. The Lafayette local controls
were mostly infected in the 1980s. Allen and McClelland were found to be HIV
positive after 1990, and so they may have viruses that are part of a pool of
virus spreading more recently in the community, and thus they may be closer to
each other than to the local controls for reasons other than direct transmission.
Comparing the key samples to inappropriate controls might lead to incorrect
conclusions, since phylogenetic associations are always relative.
</p>
<p>
Korber also believes that the courts should request participation by an
epidemiologist. The Lafayette case could have benefitted from further
investigation of Allen's other risk factors, including a more thorough
examination of her previous sexual partners, as well as a detailing of her own
history as an ICU nurse, an occupation that exposes her to patients with HIV.
Moreover, an epidemiologist could have helped define the appropriate control
group.
</p>
<p>
The whole process would be simpler if the courts could define exactly how similar
sequences need to be in order for them to be used as evidence. However, Korber
believes strict guidelines of this sort would be counterproductive.  "The virus
is changing too rapidly, and every scenario will be somewhat different," she
says.
</p>

<b>Confused Conviction</b><br><br>
<p>
The nature of testifying presents another obstacle to the accurate use of
phylogenetic analysis in court. "It is difficult to qualify your comments in a
courtroom," Korber says, "because the jury needs clarity, and it is hard to
explain scientific subtleties to non-scientists in a short time."  That means
that in situations like the Lafayette case, in which there are gray areas,
scientists are encouraged to make simple strong statements. This can result in
leaving out important distinctions and not fully describing ambiguities, in
situations where the evidence is neither simple nor strong. This could make or
break a case. In the Lafayette case, the prosecution opted to summarize their
conclusions and did not show or explain the phylogenetic trees to the jury.  The
defense, however, explained the basic concepts and science to the jury and showed
them phylogenetic trees.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, in that case, the doctor was found guilty of attempted murder. He
faces 15 to 50 years in prison. "I suspect the DNA figured very little into the
jury's decision, in the end," says Korber,  "because it was hardly mentioned in
the prosecution's closing arguments.  I think this, in an odd way, was a minor
victory. The prosecution had been arguing that the DNA data was conclusive, but
let it go in the end. Since I was trying to argue that the DNA evidence was
inconclusive in this particular case, I was pleased with this result."
</p>

<p>
It seems strange that this modern detective would be pleased that the outcome
disregarded the science with which she works daily.

This tree can be roughly considered an HIV family tree, but rather than knowing
the exact relationships, you infer them from DNA sequences.  The branching
pattern indicates the relationships of sequences in the tree; these patterns are
always relative to the sequences included in the tree. The horizontal branch
lengths represent the genetic distance between sequences (or how much the DNA has
mutated between the sequences).  The small numbers written on some of the branch
forks are bootstrap values, a statistic often employed in phylogenetic studies,
and indicate the reliability of a particular branch. The end points of the
branches represent individual HIV sequences.
</p>
<p>
The sequences labeled LC were the local control sequences used in the study,
sequences obtained from the Lafayette region. The two LCs that branch close to
the sequence labeled "lab strain" were laboratory contaminations. JT and DM are
the labels of the sequences in question; it is clear that they are closer to each
other than to the other local controls.  However, the branch lengths, or total
genetic distance, between the two was unexpectedly large for a very recent
transmission event.
</p>
<p>
Baby 1 and Baby 2 are two infants from New Orleans, who were infected by their
mothers. Their mothers were almost certainly infected heterosexually, so between
the two infant's infections are, at minimum, their two mothers and one man.  Yet
the infant HIV sequences are as closely related as JT and DM. Similarly, the MSM
and IDU sequences are from men from New Orleans whose risk factors for infection
are homosexual behavior and IV drug use. Again, they are as closely related as JT
and DM. While it is not easy to find transmission cases with branch lengths as
long as JTÕs and DMÕs in the literature, there are many examples of unrelated
cases that are as close or closer to each other than JT and DM. These
observations resulted in questions regarding the appropriateness of the local
control population.
