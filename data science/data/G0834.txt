    <B>September 23, 1999</B>:  Every year about this time thousands of
penguins rejoice to see the sun peep above the horizon in Antarctica.  
The  return of the sun  after 6 long months of chilly 
darkness means spring has arrived.  For penguins
 it's time to shed a few
pounds of blubber, find a mate, and bask in the sunshine for the next 6 months.
For a small band of scientists and technicians who wintered over 
at the south pole, it's time for supply drops, mail, and fresh fruit.
Outside the temperature begins to climb from a frigid -70 deg. C
to -25 degrees. 
Spring is in the air.
What triggers this south pole revolution?  It's called the 
autumnal equinox.

The autumnal equinox marks the beginning of autumn in the 
northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere.
This year it takes place at 7:31 am EDT on September 23
 when the Sun crosses
the equator heading south.  On the day of the equinox 
sunlight and darkness are of almost equal length.  
At the south pole the sun rises, and at the north pole it 
sets for six months.

Equinoxes occur when the subsolar point crosses the
equator, once in March (the Vernal Equinox) and again in September
(the Autumnal Equinox).  The subsolar latitude moves around during the
year because the Earth's spin axis is tilted 23.5 degrees.  
If there were no tilt, we would have no appreciable seasons.

Every planet in the solar system has seasons.  Most have four seasons
like the Earth.  
With the coming of fall for Earth's northern hemisphere our planet
joins three others in the solar system where it is also 
northern autumn:  Mars, Saturn, and Uranus. 
The approximate dates of recent
solstices and equinoxes for the other 
planets are tabulated <a href="#otherplanets">below</a>.

By convention, equinoxes and solstices are named after 
the corresponding season in the northern hemisphere.  When 
the north pole of a planet is tilted toward the sun, 
astronomers call it the Summer Solstice; when the south pole 
is tilted toward the sun it is called the Winter Solstice. 
Nevertheless, the seasons are opposite in the north and south 
hemispheres of every planet.  When it is summer in New York, 
it is winter in Sydney.   On a spring day in Paris, autumn
leaves are falling in Argentina, and so on...
In the table, all seasonal references refer 
to the northern hemisphere.

Although fall arrived on Mars nearly two
months ago, today is still a special day 
for the Red Planet because it marks the 
arrival of a new,
weather-monitoring spacecraft from earth.
Mars Climate Orbiter, the first of two JPL spacecraft to reach Mars 
this year, is set to go into orbit around the red planet to become 
our first interplanetary weather satellite and a communications relay 
for the Mars Polar Lander, which will arrive at Mars this December.
<br><br>
The Orbiter will fire its main engine at about 1:50 a.m. Pacific Daylight
Time (spacecraft time) on Thursday, Sept. 23, to slow itself down so that 
it can be captured in orbit around the planet.
<BR>
<BR>
"We're interested in what happens during all the seasons of a Mars year.
Weather is what happens from day-to-day and the year-long effect of all of
that is climate," said Dr. Richard Zurek, project scientist for the Orbiter
at JPL. "Mars Climate Orbiter will do what weather satellites do-it will
take pictures of clouds, it will look for storms, and it will try to
understand the atmospheric winds by measuring temperature and pressure and
by watching how the atmospheric distributions of dust and water vapor change
with time."
<br><br>
Seasons are caused by two factors: axial tilt and variable distance 
from the sun (orbital eccentricity).  Earth's orbit is nearly circular
so on our planet axial tilt causes almost all seasonal changes.  Mars 
has the highest orbital eccentricity of any planet except Pluto.  Its 
distance from the Sun varies between 1.64 and 1.36 AU over the martian year.
This large variation, combined with an axial tilt greater than Earth's 
gives rise to seasonal changes far greater than we experience
even in Antarctica.

From the point of view of an Earth-dweller, one of the strangest 
effects of seasons
on Mars is the change in atmospheric pressure.  During winter
the global atmospheric pressure on Mars is 25% lower than during 
summer.  This happens because of the eccentricity of Mars's orbit and a complex
exchange of carbon dioxide
 between Mars's dry-ice polar caps and its CO2 atmosphere.
Around the summer solstice when the martian north pole is tilted away 
from the sun, the northern polar cap expands as 
carbon dioxide in the polar atmosphere freezes.  At the other end of 
the planet the southern polar cap melts, giving CO<sub>2</sub> back to the 
atmosphere.  This process reverses half a year later at the winter solstice.
<br><br>
At first it might seem that these events occurring at
opposite ends of Mars would simply balance out over the 
course of the martian year, having no net effect on climate. But they don't.  
That's because Mars is 10% closer to the Sun in winter than 
it is in summer.  At the time of the winter solstice the northern 
polar cap absorbs more CO<sub>2</sub> than the southern polar cap absorbs 
half a year later.  The difference is so great
that Mars's atmosphere is noticably thinner during winter.

<br><br>

Martian seasons are peculiar by Earth standards, but they probably 
pale in comparison to seasons on Uranus.  Like Earth, the orbit
of Uranus is nearly circular so it keeps the same distance from the Sun throughout
its long year.  But, Uranus's spin axis is tilted by a 
whopping 82 degrees!  This gives rise  to extreme 20-year-long 
seasons and unusual weather.  For nearly a quarter of the Uranian 
year (equal to 84 Earth years), the sun shines directly 
over each pole, leaving the other half of the planet plunged 
into a long, dark, frigid winter.
<br><br>

<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/11/animations.html"><img src="../../newhome/headlines/images/southpole/uranus.gif" border=2 align=left alt="click for animation" width="150" height="236"></a>
<font face="arial,helvetica" size=2><b>Left</b>:
A dramatic time-lapse movie by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope 
shows seasonal changes on Uranus. Once 
considered one of the blander-looking planets, Uranus is now 
revealed as a dynamic world with the brightest clouds in the 
outer Solar System. <a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/11/index.html">more info</a>.
</font>
<br><br>

The Northern Hemisphere of Uranus is just now coming out of 
the grip of its decades-long winter. As the sunlight reaches 
some latitudes for the first time in years, it warms the 
atmosphere and triggers gigantic springtime storms comparable in size
to North America  with temperatures of 300 degrees below zero. 
In the animation pictured left the bright clouds 
are probably made of crystals of methane, which condense as warm bubbles of gas well up from deep in the atmosphere of Uranus. 

<br><br>

Uranus does not have a solid surface, but is instead a ball of mostly 
hydrogen and helium. Absorption of red light by methane
in the atmosphere gives the planet its cyan color.
Uranus was discovered March 13, 1781, by William Herschel. 
Early visual observers reported Jupiter-like cloud belts 
on the planet, but when NASA's Voyager 2 flew by 
in 1986, Uranus appeared as featureless as a cue ball. In the 
past 13 years, the planet has moved far enough along its 
orbit for the sun to shine at mid-latitudes in the Northern
 Hemisphere. By the year 2007, the sun will be shining directly 
over Uranus' equator. 

<BR>
<BR>

Mercury's seasons -- if they can be called that -- are also remarkable.
Until the 1960's it was thought that Mercury's "day" was the 
same length as its "year" keeping the same face to the
Sun much as the Moon does to the Earth. This was shown to be 
incorrect by doppler radar observations. We now
known that Mercury rotates three times during two of its years. 
Mercury is the only body in the solar system tidally locked into 
an 
orbital-to-rotational  resonance with a ratio other than 1:1. 
<br><br>
This fact and the high eccentricity of Mercury's orbit would 
produce very strange effects for an observer on Mercury's
surface. [<A HREF="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">ref</a>]
At some longitudes the observer would see the Sun rise 
and then gradually increase in apparent size as it slowly
moved toward the zenith. At that point the Sun would stop, 
briefly reverse course, and stop again before resuming its path
toward the horizon and decreasing in apparent size. All the while 
the stars would be moving three times faster across the
sky. Observers at other points on Mercury's surface would see 
different but equally bizarre motions. 

<br>
<br>

Temperature variations on Mercury are the most extreme in the solar
system ranging from 90 K at night to 700 K during the day. 
The temperature on Venus is 
slightly hotter, thanks to the greenhouse effect caused by its 
carbon dioxide atmosphere,
 but very stable. Because of Venus's thick cloud cover,
seasonal changes in temperature are likely to be small on that planet.

<h3>Meanwhile, back at the South Pole....</h3>

Meanwhile, back on Earth, astronomers are preparing to take advantage
of the coming   Antarctic day to prepare for observing when 
the sun sets 6 months from now. Although conditions at the South Pole 
are harsh astronomers are increasingly interested in making 
observations from Antarctica. The nights are long and the skies are 
dark. Southern stars are visible above the horizon for 24 hours a 
day during the winter, and the South Pole is very, very dry. This 
means that stars don't twinkle much and the atmosphere is 
exceptionally transparent. In the parlance of astronomy: 
&quot;Seeing is good.&quot;  
<a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/cara/research/allinst.html">Astronomical
instruments at the South Pole</a> include infrared telescopes and 
sub-millimeter wavelength radio telescopes used to study star 
formation, cosmic molecular clouds, and cosmology.  The newest 
addition is a radio interferometer called <a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/cara/research/cmbr/dasi.html">DASI</a>, 
a University of Chicago 
instrument designed to probe minute fluctuations in the cosmic microwave
background radiation.  DASI is currently in Chicago for last minute 
testing and fine-tuning.  After it arrives at the south pole later 
this austral summer it will begin making observations that could 
lead to important breakthroughs in our understanding of the early 
universe and how it has evolved since the Big Bang.
