                Fundamental interdisciplinary research in flow and transport of nutrients and microorganisms,
focused on developing effective methods for accelerating and optimizing bioremediation
rates.</i><p>
<H3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</H3>

                <HR>
                To develop effective methods for accelerating and optimizing <I>in situ</I>
                bioremediation processes, and where applicable, transfer this knowledge to <I>ex
                situ</I> waste treatment.<P>
                <H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
                
<HR>
<hr><h4><i>Methods for accelerating bioremediation must overcome a variety of
physical, chemical, and biological limitations.</i></h4><hr>

Many microbial isolates and consortia are capable of transforming or degrading a
wide range of environmental pollutants.  Similarly, various species of plants can
be used to transport, transform, and degrade contaminants.  However, these
processes may take too long to significantly decrease contaminant levels due to a
variety of physical, chemical, and biological limitations.  Thus, mechanisms to
address these limitations and accelerate biodegradation and biotransformation rates
are needed.  Biotransformative rates can be accelerated by (1)
biostimulation increasing the number of microorganisms in the contaminated region
by addition of chemical amendments, (2) bioaugmentation active introduction of
microorganisms to the subsurface, or (3) increasing the availability of contaminant
compounds to organisms.  Each of these approaches has been investigated at the
bench and pilot scale, and some have been implemented at full scale.  For example,
addition of nutrients and electron donors/acceptors required for the growth or
activity of endogenous microbiota and plants has been examined.  To a limited
extent, field tests of the bioaugmentation approach have also been conducted. 
Chemical additives such as surfactants have been added to increase the
bioavailability of pollutants to native or introduced degradative organisms.  And,
                to a very limited extent, bioengineered microbial isolates and plants have been
                introduced to accelerate cleanup.<p>  
                Successful use of technologies to accelerate bioremediation rates has been limited
                due to a lack of understanding of both scientific and engineering
                factors.  For example, although a good deal is known about
                biodegradation pathways for organic compounds, little is known about the
                overall interactions of the organisms carrying out these transformations
                within complex communities, within geological media, or under field
                conditions at contaminated sites.  Moreover, in many natural and
                engineered systems, biological processes are limited by mass transfer
                processes, such as molecular diffusion, that are independent of the
                organisms, and by an incomplete understanding of how geologic properties
                of the subsurface influence bioremediation.  Deficiencies of engineered
                systems for delivering nutrients and microorganisms to various
                geological media have also restricted the use of bioremediation.<p>
                <hr><h4><i>Successful use of technologies to accelerate bioremediation
                rates has been limited by a lack of understanding of both scientific and
                engineering factors.</i></h4><hr>
                A combination of scientific and engineering investigations aimed at
                achieving accelerated bioremediation rates is needed to overcome these
                limitations.  Building on new knowledge about community dynamics,
                biotransformation and biodegradation processes, biomolecular
                engineering, and phytoremediation, research is needed to address
                questions such as:<p>
                <menu>
                o    What is the optimal rate and formulation for delivery of
                                     nutrients?<p>
                o    Are nutrients delivered more effectively at a constant rate, or are
                                     cyclic rates more effective?<p>
                o    What are the most effective strategies for introducing non-endogenous
                                     organisms into aquifers and the vadose zone?<p>
                o    Under which circumstances are liquid or gas nutrient delivery systems
                                     more effective?<p>
                o    How can bioremediation rates be accelerated in low-permeability
                                     materials such as clay or sparsely fractured rock?<p>
                o    Can aerobic environments be effectively converted to anaerobic
                                     environments or vice versa?  What is required to do so?<p>
                </menu>
                <h3>APPROACH</H3>
                
<HR>
To answer questions such as these, research will focus on three topics:<P>
<menu>
1.              Microbial and chemical transport processes.<p>
2.              Biostimulation and bioaugmentation processes.<p>
3.              Delivery strategies for chemicals and microorganisms.<p>
</menu>
These research activities will build upon and synthesize information gained from
all of the program elements and focus on transferring this information from the
bench to the field.<p>
Research efforts will initially focus on identifying critical processes and
microorganisms necessary for promoting acceleration of bioremediation in laboratory
experiments that mimic <I>in situ</I> conditions.  Coordinated field and
laboratory experiments will also be initiated.  Subsequent development will include
obtaining a sufficient scientific understanding of microbial and delivery processes
to design meaningful field-scale experiments on accelerating the bioremediation of
contaminant mixtures.  It will also be necessary to develop a sufficient
understanding of biostimulation and bioaugmentation processes relevant to the field
research centers so that methods for accelerating bioremediation (and
phytoremediation) can be tested at the field research centers.  The ultimate goal
of this program element is completion of the development and testing of promising
strategies for accelerating bioremediation processes for contaminant mixtures at
DOE sites.<p>
