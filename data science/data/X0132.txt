<p>I am coaching grades 10,11,and 12 boys basketball and would like to get my hands on
some playbooks for offensive and defensive strategies. Have checked the local library and
seem to be at sort of a dead end as most of the available texts are personal experience
type of books and dont really afford the information I require. Any suggestions? Rod at
neopax@rockies.net, thx.</p>

<p>I have just been &quot;appointed&quot; to coach my son's YMCA team. I played tons of
basketball growing up, both organized and pick up in the park. I was pretty much a
&quot;natural&quot; at it. I played on a private middle school team, and was good enough
to be picked up to play with the freshman team as an eighth grader. I switched to
&quot;public&quot; school in high school and found my basketball career, at least
&quot;school&quot; team basketball was done. I tried out in 9th grade and almost made it
as a &quot;token&quot; white guy on an all black team. Then, before my junior year, we
were tranferred due to busing to another high school, which won or competed for state
championships routinely. I kept playing church league and intramural basketball through
college. I tell you all that to say, I have played tons, but this would be/will be my
first EVER coaching effort. The kids are 9 and 10 year olds. Most of them are from good
homes etc...so, my main problem will be thinking at the 9 year old level, and not like
high school or above. Questions like how complicated can offenses be have already crossed
my mind.......... I am so thankful your website is here. I have only begun to explore it.
I will be here quite often I expect. The only time I played that we had real offenses with
set plays was the two years we played in middle school. That is probably my main weakness.
Hopefully, your website will help. Thanks!!!! I'll get busy. Feel free to e-mail me with
any suggestions........................... 

<p> Brian</p>

<p> I am just starting out as a nine and ten boys coach and am looking for some basic
skill-drills along with 2 or 3 offense and defensive settups. We are in a church league so
sportsmanship and drilling fundementals are the most important things to our group. Help.

<p>My name is John, and I have volunteered to coach my son's middle school basketball
team. We are a very small Catholic school in the Denver CO area, and will barely have
enough 7th &amp; 8th graders to field a team, so I will have to draw from the 5th &amp;
6th grade boys as well. 

<p> I have never coached basketball, but have coached baseball several seasons. My main
objective is to provide a positive experience for every boy on the team. Last year, the
school's 1st year with any competitive athletics, the Athletic Director hired a coach, who
brought with him a team (5 guys, 3 quite talented for their ages) from another school. My
son, and 2 other classmates were also on the team, but had no formal team experience.
These extra 3 boys were only put into a game if the coach's elite 5 had run up at least a
20 point advantage, which they did with some regularity. Therefore, the subs got some
playing time. 

<p> But in 2 tight games, the starters played virtually every minute, and lost both games
by 1 point. Coach didn't want to hear my theory that putting in the subs would have given
the starters a rest, and a shot at winning. 

<p> To make a very long story short, I have vowed to avoid such tactics. Every boy on my
team will get &quot;quality&quot; playing time, and have fun. Hopefully, we will win a few
games in the process. I plan on NOT having a starting team. Everyone will start in some
games. 

<p> I plan on stressing defenseive footwork, good passing skills (as little dribbling as
possible), teamwork, and good sportsmanship. 

<p> Am I nuts? I hope not. And I hope these boys will have a fun season. 

<p> Any comments or advise, please e-mail me at JRiccardo@aol.com 

<p> Thanks, and good luck to all.

<p>Hello~ I recently got the C-Team coaching job at Wasilla Middle School, I was the JV
girls coach for Houston High year, but due to staff priority I have chosen to move to the
Wasilla program. I am a little nervous about the number of girls I will be coaching all by
myself! I am told there will be anywhere from 25-29 girls. I played basketball locally for
both Houston and Palmer back in 1990, but last year was my 1st experience on the other end
of the game. I can honestly say I am anxious but nervous too, I know that I work well with
the girls and we it showed in the game, but I have never been resposible for all the
charts, records and individula plays! PLEASE help ! I am open for all and any suggestions
to make this a wonderful transition for me and my girls! 

<p> Sincerly, Cams!!</p>

<p>Cams - nice to hear from you, but please leave your email address or send me a note at
sjordan@alaskalife.net so I can reply to you. I don't want to us the guestbook for
questions and answers, although a place to post questions is a great idea, come to think
of it. But, that will be a future addition to the Coach's Notebook. Steve</p>

<p>I have enjoyed your site and the information and material you presented. I especially
like the form to chart stats or shot statistics. I am the new head coach for the 7th and
8th grade girls program at Immanuel Lutheran in Palatine Il. I have only two previous
years of experience coaching basketball(5th &amp; 6th grade). The past coaches have lead
very strong programs by teaching strong fundamentals. Dribbling (esp. weak hand), tough
man to man defense, taking you man off of their strong hand, etc. I have found that the
&quot;Coache's Edge&quot; and &quot;The Basketball Highway&quot; are two other very good
sites. I look forward to your new sections on full court pressure and doubling down. I
have a question regarding &quot;blitz traps&quot; and their effectiveness or if you had
any experience with them? Gary Lischewski lischeg@baxter.com </p>

<p>Thank-you for providing some excellent warm-up drills. I am from the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan but have many relatives from Fairbanks Alaska. Urban Rahoi is my Uncle and owns
the home made lake there. Anyways Alaska is beautiful and I am glad they have a love for
Basketball..... I coach 5th grade girls basketball in a small country school. We had our
first game last Sat. and they won it with a score of 22-14. Because our little school
isn't known to have strong basketball teams it through everyone by surprise. What I
believe helped this young talented team is the fact that I started a fundamental camp of
basic ball handling last year while they were in 4th grade. We do not have teams until 5th
grade here. To bad as hockey starts when they are barely walking. It seemed top help all
10 of the girls feel comfortable ball handling. My goal this year is to have better left
hand dribblers by having all the relays, elimination games etc. done with the left hand.
Thanks again for your help. Laura Andrews vinyllady@hotmail.com</p>

<p>Just passing through the bball section of Teamdiscovery and found your reply to a
coach. I have been coaching youth basketball for about 3 years w/ marginal success. I have
the same philosophy as most, &quot;basic fundamentals beat talent everytime.&quot; 

<p> Enjoy your website. Real helpful. Some drills I totally forgot about. I really haven't
found the time to really explore this site, but so far it looks like a good site that I'm
sure that I will frequent throughout the season. 

<p> What are some good full court drills that incorporate passing and defense skills. Like
a full court 2 on 3. Any ideas. 

<p> Thanks for posting your site. Good luck in the future

<p>hey I am a new volunteer coach. I am very excited to start coaching, unfortunately I
have 4th graders so my options as a coach are very limited. I was wondering if you could
help me with a couple of approaches as far as Man to man offense/Defense....and fun
drills. (Keep in mind they MUST be very simple, yet I would like them effective. 

<p> Thank you and hope to hear from you soon.

&amp; offense.

<p>Dewayne Brock Athens, Alabama brockd@hiwaay.net I really enjoyed your pre-game warm-up
drills. I would also like to know what kind of defense you teach. I'm starting a 5th &amp;
6th grade traveling team &amp; I would like to know some of your principles in defense
&amp; offense. 

<p> Thanks, Dewayne</p>

<p>Good information. I am a second year coach at the fifth grade level in Overland Park,
Kansas. I did not play organized BB but enjoy the game and played extensively in
intramurals and pick-up games. Your site provides alot of good input to someone in my role
as a coach who has on been &quot;coached&quot;. 

<p> As a Kansas graduate, it is difficult to not get excited about college basketball and
the game in general. 

<p> Thank you sharing your knowledge on the game and making it available through your
site. 

<p> Thanks, Charlie Watts cbwatts@hotmail.com </p>

<p>Thanks for the info on pre-game warmups. We've been doing the same old things for the
past 3-4 years (we saw them at a college game in Philadelphia) and have been thinking
about changing the whole pre-game routine. I like your drills - I may add a few to some
that we do. I discovered your website by accident. You should link to &quot;The Basketball
Highway&quot; at www.bbhighway.com - lots of good stuff for coaches there. I've always
wanted to visit Alaska, maybe when I retire!

<p>Great site. I just landed my 1st Varsity job coaching Girls from a small rural school
in Caledonia-Mumford, NY. Your information has put my mind at ease a bit. I had coached at
the J.V. level for the past 2 years, but I am still a bi nervous. The better prepared I am
the more confident I'll be, this site has helped!!

<p>Great job Mr. Jordan. I begin coaching juniors (age 8) in our local league in a couple
of weeks. This is my younger son's first year. I feel much more certain just reading
through your notes for the first time. I only wish I had been this prepared when my older
boy had begun (but we had fun seasons anyway). Thanks again.

<p>Coach, great site for all coaches. I just finished playing HS Basketball in '95, and

insight on hoops and coaching. Great site! Gary Baker <a href="mailto:bakergar@shu.edu">bakergar@shu.edu</a></p>

<p>Hi how you doing? I love your site. I am a fairly new coach and i was just looking for

pressing. If u could suggests a few of your favorites i would appreciate it. My e-mail

<p>great site!!!!! I was wondering if you would have any ideas on how to get involved with
a team at this time of year? I am thinking about just starting at the junior basketball
level and maybe going into something better next season. That is if I can't find anything
better this season. If you have any ideas please write me at jasesmit@hotmail.com. I live
in the Indianapolis area if that helps any... Thanks!!!!!

<p>This is a great site - hope you'll continue it &amp; expand it! Keep up the good work! 

<p> This is my 6th year coaching youth basketball, having coached both boys &amp; girls
from 4th to 8th grade levels. We are a Catholic School campus near Portland, Oregon that
includes both a grade school (grades K-6) and middle/high school (grades 7-12). Our focus
has always been &quot;kids first - winning second&quot;,and we try to make sure they have
a positive and fun experience - win or lose.

<p>Your site seems to be molded around exactly what I need. I had hoped to see a list of
books you recommend for first time coaches and where to buy them. I signed up to be a
coach for the local youth league 3rd grade boys but really need help learning the answers
to questions that expose my ignorance of the game and coaching. Could recommend some?
Maybe you could add a link called &quot;Basketball for Dummies&quot;

<p>This is great! I coached my son's 5-6 year old tean last year and now I've moved up to
the big league-my daughter's 9-10 year old rec. team. When I played high school ball we
still played half court. Luckily my Assistant Coach played college ball. She has the
skills and I'm the organizer and motivator. I plan to visit your site many times to help
me get a plan. Great easy to understand information. Thanks, Cathy Griffith

<p>This is a great site. I was able to pick up some good out of bounds plays. I have a few
plays of my own that are also working well. I am looking for a good drill that will get
girls to screen out for the rebound. they are afraid to make contact with each other.

<p>Another Coach and myself are coaching a 4th grade team, neither onr of us played b-ball
at h.s. level and are in the position of coaching the school's only 4th gr. team. Your
site has been extremly helpful in developing a pattern for practices and basic play. We
had one practice last week and have 2 more this wek before our first game this saturday.
My problem now is that 3 of our 7 players want to over -do a team drill-going 100% instead
of 1/2 speed stealing balls when trying to teach offensive sets/plays. How do I
motivate/teach that to slow down to learn is a good thing?? THANKS dm0804@aol.com</p>

<p>I have really enjoyed your site! I coach 7th grade girls basketball, and I really like
the fact that there were some SIMPLE offenses and defenses included. It is so much easier
to start out simple and then build on that. Thanks for your time and effort of putting
this site together. I have coached for 20 years now... and your site is a good resource. 

<p> You may want to include some zone offenses against a 2-3 zone or a 1-3-1 or match-up
zone. There are not too many people that play a 2-1-2 zone anymore. 

<p> Thanks, Mary Harmon mrharmon@mindspring.com </p>

<p>I just wanted to thank you and congratulate you on a suberb website. My son (a 5th
grader) just starting playing this year, and have been asked by the volunteer coaches to
help coach. Having never coached Basketball (played alot), I was a bit apprehensive. I
guess the saving grace is that I have been coaching youth football and baseball for
practically my entire adult life and really enjoy it. I believe the information and tips
contained in your website will certainly make my coaching basketball a very rewarding and
enjoyable experience. I believe it will help my pickup games quite a bit as well. 

<p> Once again, Great Job and Thank you very very much.

<p>Hi Coach, great sight. 

<p> I am coaching a 2nd and 3rd grade, co-ed basketball team. Honestly I have little
experience as a coach and this web sight is proving most helpful. It's hard to remember,
sometimes, that these kids are young and don't know anything about basketball! I am
looking forward to this challenge and will depend on your tips on this page to help me
teach these kids the fundamentals of basketball!!!

<p> I am coaching an 8th grade level girls basketball team in a competitive league at
Family First in Erie, PA. I am unfamiliar with the competition. We are only able to
practice twice a week. I want to make sure I play all the girls a fairly equal amount of
time but still be competitive enough to try to win. We have the standard motion offense
against Man to man and a motion zone offense. Any tips. Thanks.

<p>Hey Coach, 

<p> I just wanted to THANK YOU for producing such an excellent website, with such great
info. It was just what I needed. I have a love for/knack for coaching kids, but I am
technically ignorant. I have two sons that are both allstars in all the sports they play,
but....I really want to be able to take them further, and I only played 4th grade
basketball. I am really learning a lot from your experiential site here. I also really
want to coach the fundamentals (I was not taught or coached well/quit in discouragement
when I was a kid)....if anything, this is my strongpoint, a sensitivity to the
emergent/unconfident player, who could come alive if coached well. Let me tell you that in
part, some of the info I learned here made a huge difference in a really big game: 

<p> Last Sat, Dec 4 was my younger boys' first 3-4th grade game. The other team opted to
play their best two players (accounted for 32 of their 35 pts). the whole game. I had
rotated all of our players to give them a good game. Anyway, with 3 minutes left, we're
down by 8. We're allowed to full court press at the 2 minute mark. Guess what!.......We
won 37-35!...(The win isn't so important to me as ego strokes for coach, but fo my younger
son, whose always in the shadow of his 10 yr old older brother who is on a club team that
just got all new stuff courtesy of Nike. anyway, I want him to have a good run with BBall
too....he was our point guard....had 7 steals, 4 assists-with 20% shooting hehe (the big
one being passing it to the most open, and most dorky player on our team for the winning
basket), and had the most points for our team......so on behalf of his emotional well
being, I really thank you 

<p> hanks to getting a little bit of a handle on how to press......and the confidence to
coach..... 

<p> PS: I especially like the way you put out the info in bite size/learnable
chunks.....if you haven't considered writing a book, you should, because this is certainly
one of the best sites out there.......I started a &quot;Coaches Notebook&quot;, mostly
packed with your stuff, and it is helping me immensely.

<p>Coach Jordan, 

<p> Thank you for creating this website ... I've spent a good portion of the day searching
the net for some basic information as I get ready to coach for the first time. 5th &amp;
6th graders in the YMCA league. 

<p> I printed your basin offensive and defensive skills, as well as your pre-game warm-up
drills, as I think they'll be the most helpful in getting the team started. 

<p> I'm primariyl looking for good fundamental drills to run for kids that age group. 

<p> Any further suggestions? 

<p> Thanks, 

<p> Tighe Curran St. Joseph, MI

<p>Thank you so much for this well written website, especially the section on
&quot;PLAYING TIMES&quot;. As a mother of a less-talented 10 year old player, I hope the
copy that we gave her coach will provide him with some insight to the feelings of all
parents and their children who are not given the opportunity to play. I think it is a must
read for all coaches of small children. 

<p> Thanks again, Pghme@aol.com</p>

me a lot last year. This season we are 0-4 with 6 games remaining 3 of those games were
lost by 15 points or less. I look forward to more helpful hints from this site. Thanks

<p>Dear Sir, I am a parent with a son on a travel team (representative). I have coached
many different sports but not basketball. What is usually the routine for substituting
players. I thought platooning was a means where all players learn to play as a team and
each player understands and respects each others skills. This is what I have learned from
watching other coaches my son has played with. I don't know any better. I would like to
learn from you. Regards Julie Walsh</p>

<p><i>Hello - if you had left an email address I would've answered you personally, but
that's OK. I think your definition of platooning fits. I use it to describe when I sub 5
players at a time. Unless your league specifies substitution protocol, it is totally&nbsp;
left up to the coach's discretion, which means he/she may not play every player in a game.
The coach's reasons are his/her own. The Coach's Notebook, though, advocates that every
kid plays every game. Did you see the article on <a href="playingtime.html">playing time</a>?
Steve</i></p>

<p>Have question. I recently got &quot;trapped&quot; into coaching a elementary school
level basketball program of leftovers (the boys no other coach wanted). These kids have a
lot of heart, but only about three have any real basketball skills. I need a lot of help
with basketball skill development--especially any designed for the short term. They played
their first game last Friday (14-01-00) and lost 68-3. I took over coaching on Monday. I
immediately began basic skills training (i.e. dribbling, passing, ball-handling, shooting,
and basic knowledge of the game). There actually was improvement after one practice, but
it is still far short of what's needed. What I do need is an offense that can defeat the
2-1-2 zone. Something simple and basic. I really appreciate this site. Keep up the good
work.

who go volunteered to coach 5th and 6th grade boys. We have one boy who is like you put it
a superstar. I have tried to encourage all the boys to work together but it seems like he
ends up with the ball all the time. The others during the game want to pass it to him.
What can I do during practice time to get them to work together?</p>

<p>Thank you for putting together such a valuable site not only for parents but for
coaches and players. I can only hope our basketball coach here in Hamden, CT will read and
benefit from your articles. His biggest problem is communication. He doesn't talk to his
players and has never spoken to us in the three years my son has been a member of the
time. My oldest was the captain this year and resigned half way thur the season. After two
years of starting, the coach sat him and we still don't know why. He wrote a wonderful
letter when he resigned that has finally made those who are in charge listen. He told the
Principal during the last meeting he had with her, that he did more good for his team by
resigning than he ever could have done by staying. It all comes down to communication.
Again thank you for the information. Sandy Hulk</p>

<p>To Coach Jordan, 

<p> I would hope to make it big as a high school basketball coach, or a college coach.
This will be decided by the way I choose my future with my current job. I would like to
know if the possibility of a young guy like myself to really get a fair chance to start
out coaching on different levels of the game. I'm 24 years old and have coached two years
for my church league and have had much succes with that. This really gives me much
ambition to continue to coach no matter what may happen. This internet site was very
helpful, thanks for all your help.

<p> Wish i would have found your site last fall, I coach High school freshman girls team
in which most of these girls slipped through 7 th and 8th grade basketball with little or
no basic skills. This was me and the JV coaches first year and we intend to change these
problems, your website is a great tool to help us achieve our goal! Thanks and keep it up

<p>Coach thanks for putting together this insightful web page, and sharing the
&quot;knowledge.&quot; I am having a problem accessing the topics button in the upper
right hand corner. I think it is because your frame is too large for 13-14 inch monitors.
Can you give us another way to access your archives. Thanks Dan Woschitz

<p>Coach Jordan, I really enjoyed the &quot;Coach's Notebook&quot;. I am visiting here for
the first time and come here via the egroup for coaches. What a wealth of information you
have provided for coaches and players alike from inexperienced to the more competetive and
experienced coaches,etc. Thank you for taking the time to offer such a wide variety of
topics and for posting this location in your recent egroup posting.

<p>This year I will be coaching 5/6 grade boys in your opinion what type of defense works
best for this age group. also what kind of plays work best against zone defense. If you
have any other ideas I would appreciate then THANKS 

<p> pfgoofy@aol.com 

<p>Most teams in this age group will have a full court press and fall back into a zone.
That's easy and may provide some wins for you. But, if you really want to help the kids be
better players, stick with man to man, and teach it from the feet up. This will take
patience on your part and hard work for the players, but they will be more effective
defenders later on. I see a lot of 9th graders in high school who have many years of youth
leagues, but are very fundamentally unsound, so despite their experience, they are
&quot;behind&quot; competitively speaking. 

<p align="left">Man to man defense is explained in two articles here: <a href="man2man.html">Basic Man to Man</a> and <a href="pressurem2m.html">Pressure Man to
Man</a>. Best wishes.<br>

<p>I'm an assistant coach for two youth teams (girls) in northern New York. They are a
great bunch of girls, and I have noticed in a few girls that there self-esteem is stronger
since playing. Unfortunatley, there are only a few games on the schedule. I would like to
organize a really cool tournament, where all the girls get a trophy and t-shirt. My
question is how do I go about organizing one and how to get businesses to sponsor it? I
hope you can give me some tips on how to pull this off! Thank-you. Kelly Gooley

by the way, my dad just got back about 3 weeks ago from a two week fishing and hunting
trip in Anchorage and Soldotna. He really enjoyed it and said it was beautiful and cool
there. Where we live, we have been having 104-108 degree weather with heat indexes of

<p>Coach, 

<p> I am a sixth grade coach at a local middle school and going to school to earn a degree
in scholastic administration and minoring in coaching. I have always known that coaching
is my calling, It just comes naturally to me its a passion. Far deep down almost
unexplainable with words. But i also am up to hearing any coaching advice you may have for
me. Please email me i am eager to learn. My email address is coachc@hotmail.com or you can
mail me at Bradley Cotten 79 wilcox rd. Grayson, KY 41143 my phone # is (606) 475-3657 or
475-3757</p>

<p> <i> Editor's Note:</i></p>

<p>Thanks for your entry in the Coach's Notebook. You asked for general advice for a 6th
grade coach who has a passion for coaching. Well, I suggest you read my site thoroughly -
my heart and soul is in there and I add to it occasionally. On my links page is a table of
several other coaches who have freely presented their thoughts. Finally, at the top of my
links page is a link to ChalkTalk - the best forum for basketball coaches I know of. Check
it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p> As for quick advice - Stick to fundamental skills. 6th graders MUST learn to play with
either hand - especially dribbling and shooting lay-ups. If they cannot do those skills
very well by ninth grade, they probably won't make their high school teams. A note of
encouragement: Most of my kids can use their weak hand effectively after just one season.
For you: Keep everything simple and upbeat. Never yell at or criticize the players. Play
everybody about the same even if some kids are obviously better. By next year your kids
will not remember this season's win/loss record, so don't place any emphasis on it. What
they will remember is if they got to play and had a good time. If you have specific
questions, I would love to discuss them. Please write back if you do.

Plenty for me too. Still playing a couple of times a week at 49. I can really feel my game

<p>Coach, I coached grade 6 and 7 boys last season and enjoyed the experience so much that
I have taken on the 11 and 12 year old Night league team. This is a bigger commitment than
the school team as it runs from Sept. until Easter. I am looking for innovative ways to
keep the practices interesting while still working on skills ie ball handling, shooting,
team defence, rebounding, passing etc. I would like to see some continuous shooting drills
and layup drills where everyone could be involved. Also I would like to run what we call
in Canada is a MOTION OFFENCE where no one stands still and every movement has a purpose.
However, this offence can't be too complicated or the boys won't remember it when we need
it. Do you have any suggestions?? Thanks, Coach Mike email: MikeSue@IslandNet.com</p>

practice time and not many really great players. My motto is keep it simple. Thanks for

soccer for 4 years. A friend of mine referred me to your web site. It is excellent. I am
blending it with some of the good advice I have received from others.

<p>Coach, you have a well-rounded covering of the many aspects that relate to basketball.
I am one of those just regular people trying to help some young boys to learn this sport.
The only problem is that I played my last high school game (35) years ago and have
forgotten some of the basics. 

<p> Your site has been a God-send to our program. Appreciate you Coach !! Frank R. Smith

<p>I had my first practice, and used your article as a guide. It went well, and I think
the kids had fun. I would like to know your opinion on how to set up a game strategy. I
have 9 players 4- fourth graders, 2-3rd graders, 4- second graders. We play 8-period games
and all kids must play at least 3 periods. Two of my fourth graders are very good, both
3rd graders are good and 2 second graders are good. Any suggestions?</p>

<p><i>Hmmm... I'd play the kids man to man, play everybody about the same number of
minutes, and emphasize spacing in the offense. Keep the ball in the middle of the floor
and in the hands of your best ball handlers. Make sure the kids move towards the pass to
catch it. Above all, keep the kids happy and encourage them to have fun. - Steve</p>

it. I need help. My email is mbar23@aol.com Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p><i>You're in luck. I have already prepared material on the triangle offense. In the
topic menu in the upper right hand corner, scroll down to &quot;Simplified Triangle
Offense&quot; and check out the diagrams and text. We used this offense all season last

<p>Coach Jordan, I just wanted to compliment you on putting together such an informative
and entertaining site. Great Job! 

<p> I was wondering if you or any other readers have used the Triple Post offense, and if
so, what their experiences have been as far as getting players comfortable with the
continuity portion. 

<p> I am also interested in gathering information on coaches/players exposure to abuse and
harrassment in sports.

<p>I coach Grade 8 boys and we are off to a rocky start (0-4 in league play). I like the
Alaska play and will try to implement this coming week at practice and during two
exhibition games. I am having some difficulties with players not fully committed to the
team. Being a football coach as well I find this tough to understand. Is it the age?
Thanks. roger kelly <a href="mailto:(rkellyis@home.com">(rkellyis@home.com</a>) 

<p><i>Its not the age so much as the times. Athletes have so many choices! Try to be a
little understanding. Its best for the kids to experiment several things as they grow up.
Hopefully you'll always have a core of kids that will give your sport first priority.

<p>Great site! I love the simplicity you encourage. I have coached young kids for years
and my experience has confirmed your recommended approach - keep it simple and focus on
the fundamentals. Even kids with almost no athletic ability will surprise you over a
season. Be patient, stick to your plan, and think long-term. Let them make their mistakes
- keep having your players pass to the open man - even if that kid has trouble catching
the ball. It can be frustrating, especially for the better players, but they will all
agree it is worth it in the end. 

<p> I will certainly encourage other coaches of young people to visit your site. 

<p> Keep up the good work!

<p>I love your b-ball site. Everything is good. I'm interested in getting the ball in
bounds against excellent man to man pressure, and then advancing it. We don't have Shaq
and Kobe to help us bring us it up. The other teams are much quicker, bigger and faster,
so we have to be technically correct in what we do just to get it in. chuckosgood@drc.com</p>

competent. Your site gave me great tips and not to mention, a load of confidence. I want
to continue coaching and am having a great season thus far. Thank you for taking the time
to develop this website to help people like me who know we can do it, but aren't afraid
for a little help. Gretchen McWilliams-Howell whowell@rcvideo.com </p>

<p>I wanted you to know that you have awesome materials for all levels. These materials
and tools were very helpful to coach our youngest basketball stars, ages 5 - 9. This is my
first year of actually coaching youth basketball after many years of assisting. I've given
your web site to many of my friends and all of them think it's the best literature for the
veterans and rookie coaches out there!

<p>I think your site is great. I have used many of the plays that you have shown us and
applied them to my coaching. I have been a youth coach now for 5 years, I follow the kids
up every grade starting from kidnergarden. We have been very successful, with a record of
36-4 in the 5 year span. The Tigers and myself thank you for the plays and tips you have
given us. Thank You, Jonathan Carter and The Tigers</p>

<p>Hi, I just found your site from Coach Riley's basketball book posted on
Powerbasketball. I haven't had a chance to look around yet but I'm sure it will be a good
experience. 

<p> I have been coaching youth basketball for almost 11 years. It is a 6th grade boys
team. It is a competitive league and a lot of the kids go on to play high school and
college ball. I just started a not-so-competitive league of co-eds from 6th-8th grades
also. That one is alot of fun also. 

<p> Thanks for sharing with the rest of us coaches out there!

<p>Hi I LOVE your site!!! I have a question...I am on a middle school basketball team and
well...we haven't had the greatest season. So everyone on the team is kinda bummed and
depressed thinking that there is no hope for us now. I have been cheering them on and
saying &quot;good job&quot; or &quot;nice try&quot;, but I don't think that it is helping
much. Is there anything else that I could do to pep them up? Please help!

<p>Coach, I really enjoy your site. Last year I checked in about once a week at least. I
used your Alaska offense and we had a lot of fun with it. Over the summer we moved to a
different state, and much to my surprise I ended up with a coaching job. I will use your
site again this year, keep up the good work. Right now I am having problems accessing all
of the topics, is this just my computer or are you doing some work on the site? Don

<p>HI, I believe that as coaches they should not only teach the sport, but they should
teach the students a life learned lesson. With this you can have a good connection with
the people you are coaching. You will be considered a good coach. I can honestly say that
I had one &quot;Good Coach,&quot; in high school. I could talk to her and learn lessons
about life and basketball. My coach was Stephani Gray. She is great. If every coach had a
quality like hers then every player would probably be more coachable and respect you as a
person and a coach. 

<p> Future Coach, Angellica Grayson</p>

<p> <i>Sounds like you'll be a great coach. Good luck.</i></p>
