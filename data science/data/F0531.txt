Being 
primarily a VB developer, I wasn't sure how useful this book would be to me in 
order to learn more about the .NET framework. However as I delved deeper into 
the book, I realised that the concepts I would pick up from the book would apply 
equally to any .NET language I might decide to use. The book itself assumes that 
you have a background in C++ or Java, and for the most part it does help to know 
those languages, but anyone who has a background in object oriented programming 
should be able to follow the book. The book also appears to have been written 
before Beta 2 of the .NET SDK was released, but since the book is an 
architectural reference for C#, there shouldn't be many changes if any between 
Beta 1 and Beta 2 versions of C#. Also if you are going to be reading this book 
to find out more about Windows Forms programming, ADO.NET or ASP.NET programming 
in C#, you will be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you are going to be 
reading this book to learn about the C# language then this book is a good place 
to start.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The book is well organised taking the reader from the fundamentals 
right up to advanced topics such as multithreading, working with COM objects and 
assemblies. The book is written in a style which makes it easy to read, which is 
essential since some of the topics may be difficult to grasp for a novice 
developer. I believe that a good understanding of the .NET framework will be 
essential for any developer who wants to write applications for the .NET 
environment no matter what language they develop in, and this book does a good 
job on focussing on the basics. Even if the language used is C#, the concepts 
will apply equally to VB.NET, J# or any other .NET language. </P>
<P>Overall, the book is a good solid introduction to C#. The coverage of the 
book is very broad, covering all aspects of C# though not in great detail but 
just enough to provide a good foundation to build upon. However, once you have 
learnt the material in the book, I don't see many developers reading it again 
because they will have moved on to more advanced books. </P></TD></TR></Table>
