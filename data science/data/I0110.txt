    SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC AND MANCHESTER UNITED PLC: A SUMMARY OF THE
    MONOPOLIES AND MERGERS REPORT ON THE PROPOSED MERGER</span></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">On 29
October 1998 the Secretary of State referred to us the proposed acquisition by
British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (BSkyB) of Manchester United PLC (Manchester
United). We have concluded that
arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect,
will result in the creation of a merger situation qualifying for investigation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">BSkyB is a
vertically integrated broadcaster which buys TV rights, including those for
sporting events, makes some of its own programmes, packages programmes from a
range of sources into various channels, and distributes and retails these
channels to its subscribers using its direct-to-home satellite platform as well
as selling them wholesale to other retailers using different distribution
platforms.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">On all
relevant measures, Manchester United is the strongest English football club. Its
football-related activities include the supply of TV rights for its matches. At
present the rights to Manchester United’s Premier League matches, together
with those of other Premier League clubs, are sold collectively by the Premier
League itself. This arrangement is currently the subject of a Restrictive
Practices Court (RPC) case brought by the Director General of Fair Trading.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We have
concluded that the relevant football market in which Manchester United operates
is no wider than the matches of Premier League clubs. We considered whether the
broadcasting market in which BSkyB operates ought to comprise both pay TV and
free-to-air TV and concluded that it was more appropriate to treat pay TV as a
separate market. Based primarily on considerations of substitutability, we
concluded that the relevant market for our purposes was for sports premium TV
channels.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Except for
small niche channels, BSkyB is currently the only provider of sports premium
channels. Entry into this market depends crucially upon the ability of a channel
provider to obtain the appropriate live sports rights. We think it unlikely that
there are enough such rights to sustain many sports premium channels and BSkyB
currently provides three. BSkyB’s very high market share together with the
difficulties of entry lead us to conclude that BSkyB has market power in the
sports premium channel market.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In
considering the public interest consequences of the merger, we looked primarily
at its effects on competition among broadcasters for live Premier League rights.
Because of uncertainties about the outcome of the RPC case on the collective
selling of Premier League rights, we considered four scenarios, one or other of
which may be expected to occur. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Our first
scenario involved the continuation of existing collective selling arrangements
and no other mergers between broadcasters and Premier League clubs. We have
concluded that under this scenario, BSkyB would, as a result of the merger, gain
influence over and information about the Premier League’s selling of rights
that would not be available to its competitors. It would also benefit from its
ownership stake in Premier League rights, providing a further advantage in the
bidding process.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Taken
together, these factors would significantly improve BSkyB’s chances of
securing the Premier League’s rights. We would expect this to influence the
behaviour of BSkyB’s competitors causing them to bid more cautiously than
would otherwise be the case and, in some cases, even not to bid at all. This
would enhance BSkyB’s already strong position arising from its market power as
a sports premium channel provider and from being the incumbent broadcaster of
Premier League football. The effect would be to reduce competition for Premier
League rights leading to less choice for the Premier League and less scope for
innovation in the broadcasting of Premier League football.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Under our
other scenarios we have concluded that:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">If the
live rights of Premier League clubs were to be sold on an individual basis and
there were no other mergers between broadcasters and clubs, BSkyB would, as a
result of the merger, have substantial advantages over other broadcasters
competing for the rights. This would have adverse effects for competition
similar to those we identified under our first scenario.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">If
existing selling arrangements continued and the BSkyB/Manchester United merger
were to precipitate a further merger between a broadcaster and a Premier League
club, the effects on competition of the merger between BSkyB and Manchester
United would be broadly similar to those of our first scenario. If there were
several mergers between broadcasters and Premier League clubs precipitated by
the BSkyB/Manchester United merger, then we believe that collective selling
would continue only if broadcasters agreed among themselves to share the rights,
which would have at least as adverse an effect on competition as our first
scenario.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">If rights
were sold on an individual basis and there were several mergers between
broadcasters and Premier League clubs precipitated by the BSkyB/Manchester
United merger, all of the feasible outcomes would be less competitive than the
situation in which rights were individually sold and no broadcaster/Premier
League club mergers had occurred.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In most of
the situations described in paragraphs 1.7 to 1.9, the merger would enhance
BSkyB’s ability to secure Premier League rights in future. We would expect
this further to restrict entry into the sports premium channel market by new
channel providers, causing the prices of BSkyB’s sports channels to be higher
and choice and innovation less than they otherwise would be. Reduced entry by
sports premium channel providers would feed through into reduced competition in
the wider pay TV market.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We
conclude that, under all of the scenarios described in paragraphs 1.7 to 1.9,
the merger may be expected to reduce competition for Premier League rights with
the consequential adverse effects we have identified.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We have
based our public interest conclusions mainly on the effects of the merger on
competition among broadcasters. However, we also think that the merger would
adversely affect football in two ways. First, it would reinforce the existing
trend towards greater inequality of wealth between clubs, thus weakening the
smaller ones. Second, it would give BSkyB additional influence over Premier
League decisions relating to the organization of football, leading to some
decisions which did not reflect the long-term interests of football. On both
counts the merger may be expected to have the adverse effect of damaging the
quality of British football. This adverse effect would be more pronounced if the
merger precipitated other mergers between broadcasters and Premier League clubs.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We were
unable to identify any public interest benefits from the proposed merger. We
therefore conclude that the proposed merger between BSkyB and Manchester United
may be expected to operate against the public interest.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">We
considered whether the adverse effects we have identified could be remedied by
undertakings by BSkyB. We did not find any that we regarded as effective. We
think that the adverse effects are sufficiently serious that prohibiting the
merger is both an appropriate and a proportionate remedy. Accordingly, we
recommend that the acquisition of Manchester United by BSkyB should be
prohibited.</span>
