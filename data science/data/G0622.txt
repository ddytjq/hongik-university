<b><a name="background">Background Information:</a></b>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there other solar systems like ours?  If there are, then conditions
to sustain life may exist elsewhere.  It was recently reported at the
annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston that new
close-up images of Jupiter's moon Europa reveal that large blocks of ice
on the moon have moved and rotated.  This suggests to scientist Robert
T. Pappalardo of Brown University in Providence, RI, that an ocean may have existed in the past and may still exist as a  subsurface ocean.  On Earth, abundant life has been discovered near hydrothermal
vents deep on the ocean floor.  Perhaps, subocean volcanic vents exist
on Europa, and biological life may exist there also.  Scientists have
long wondered if there is life, or once was life, on Mars.  These are
some of the questions that scientists are studying in our own solar
system.

<p>To conduct their scientific investigations, NASA has a strategy that
requires three phases of exploration:  reconnaissance, surveillance, and
in-depth study.
<ol>
<li>Reconnaissance means to observe an object intently for a short
period of time using a flyby mission.  A spacecraft makes one pass by a
planet, radios back its data, and continues on into space.
<p><li>Surveillance means to observe an object intently for a long period
of time using an orbiting spacecraft.  The spacecraft will point its
instruments at the planet and record volcanic, geological, or atmospheric
activity.  Orbiters usually orbit in a north-south axis over the
planet's poles so that it can view a different piece of the planet with
each rotation.
<p><li>In-depth study is the final phase of data gathering, when you, or
your robots, land on the planet and explore a small area in great detail, 
like the Apollo missions to the moon or the Viking missions to Mars.

<b><a name="procedures">Procedures:</a></b>
<ol>
<li>Divide the class into groups of four students.  Have the students
brainstorm about all the previous space explorations and missions that
they know about. (If time, students can gather information from
NASA Web site data.)  Have the students record the mission destination,
the scientific goal of the mission, the hazards, and what was learned
from the expedition.

<p><li>Discuss with the students the missions of exploration that are
currently being planned by the United States and the scientific goals
that are being proposed. 
 
<p><li>Then provide students with the following activity.
<blockquote>
<p> A deep-space probe, 
sent out by NASA, has sent back some very
interesting data to mission control.  Scientists have discovered a star
that is wobbling in a solar system on the far side of our galaxy.  The
wobble is caused by the pull of a planet orbiting around the star.  With
new space-flight technology, an expedition has been proposed for the
year 200l.   Your team has been asked to submit a three-phase expedition
proposal.  To prepare your team plan, design each of the following six
project steps.

<p>Each member of the team will assume one the following roles.  Mission
scientists look at existing data and determine what observations should
be made; mission planners name the mission and decide what set of
spacecraft will be needed for each phase of the mission;  mission
controllers decide on the order of the flights, the launch site and
the way that data will be returned from space; and spacecraft
personnel decide on launch operations, timeline, and how data will be
collected and returned to mission scientists.

<p>Step 1.  As a group, decide on the scientific goal of your team.

<p>Step 2.  Design a reconnaissance mission.  What questions does your
group wish to have answered about the planet?  What data will
specifically be collected about the charateristics of the planet, its
surface, and its atmosphere?

<p>Step 3.  With the results of the reconnaissance mission, design a
surveillance mission to investigate ongoing planetary activity.

<p>Step 4.  With your scientific goal(s) in mind, describe the in-depth
study your team would make.  Would the mission be manned or robotic? 
Because in-depth study missions can only explore small areas, site
selection is an important part of your proposal.  Data from previous
missions must be analyzed to select the safest and most productive
scientific location to land.  Where will you land?  Why? What
do you expect to learn and why is it important?

<p>Step 5.  Design a mission patch that reflects your team goals and
mission experiments.  

<p>Step 6.  Each group will formally present its mission proposal to the
rest of the class, who should be invited to make recommendations for
improvements.  After each group has presented, display the mission
patches in the room or in some other display area.</blockquote>

<p>Evaluation/Assessment:  Students will summarize the scientific goals
of the other teams in their notebooks and write a three-minute
reflection  about what they have learned and about what they still don't know
about space exploration.  End the reflection piece by describing what
studies and missions each student thinks should be conducted in the
future.

<b><a name="extensions">Extensions:</a></b>

<ul>
<li>Middle School Extensions -- Have the students select a location within the
school or school grounds that they would like to visit. (With staff
and administration cooperation, locations like the principal's bathroom,
cafeteria storage, orchestra pit, boiler room are all possibilities.)
Each student, before conducting the actual expedition should  (1) select
a location and a  goal once he or she gets there, (2)prepare a map of the
route, (3) design and make a flag that will be placed at the destination
if he or she is successful, and (4) return and report back to the class
about the expedition.  The teacher, at the home base, must sign each
expedition proposal before students are allowed to leave.  Only provide
5-10 minutes for the actual exploration portion. Establish rules ahead
of time:  (1) no new members added to the group, (2) no bathroom breaks on route,
(3) permission must be given and signed to access locked areas, (4) no
disturbing other classes, and so on. 

<p><li>Independent Student Extensions --  Contact the National Science Teachers
Association to receive the application form for the Space Science
Student Involvement Program.  Students may apply  for Aerospace
Internships by proposing and writing experiments that could
theoretically be performed at one of the NASA facilities.   A separate
competition invites students to plan and design an expedition to Mars
and to propose an experiment to be done sometime during the journey.  To
receive information, send an e-mail to MAISER@NSTA.ORG</ul>
