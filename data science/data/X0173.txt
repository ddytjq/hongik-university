<h1>ARTICLE II - DOUBLE DISC COURT</h1>

<p><u>Comment</u>: Double disc court is a game played by two
teams of two players each. Each team is charged with defending a
court from the attack of the opponents. The attacks are made in
two ways: by the throwing of one of two discs in play into the
opponents' court in an attempt to have the disc come to rest
within that court without ever having touched out-of-bounds, or
by causing both discs to be touched by a player or players on the
opposing team at the same time. A team scores a point whenever
they make a successful attack or whenever an opponent throws a
disc out-of-bounds. The first team to score the requisite number
of points as determined by the competitive format shall win the
game.</p>

<p>The purpose of the following rules is to provide a guideline
which describes the way the game is played. Disc sports have
traditionally relied on a spirit of sportsmanship which places
the responsibility for fair play on the players themselves.
Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense
of the bond of mutual respect between players, adherence to the
agreed upon rules of the game, or the basic enjoyment of play.
Protection of these vital elements serves to eliminate adverse
conduct from the playing field. Such actions as taunting the
opposing players, dangerous aggression, intentional violation of
the rules, or other &quot;win-at-all-costs&quot; behavior are
contrary to the spirit of the game and must be avoided by all
players. Violations which compromise this understanding may
result in penalties or disqualification by the tournament
director.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Preliminary Considerations</i>:
                        Prior to the start of play, the teams
                        shall resolve the preliminary
                        considerations through the disc flipping
                        method (104.03). The team winning the
                        flip shall have its choice on one of the
                        three options for the first exchange of
                        the match: <ul>
                            <li>(1) which court they will defend;
                                or, </li>
                            <li>(2) which team shall initiate;
                                or, </li>
                            <li>(3) which team shall declare its
                                server. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The team losing the flip shall then
                        have its choice on one of the two
                        remaining options, leaving the final
                        option to the team winning the flip. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Readiness</i>: Each team shall
                        prepare for the commencement of play by
                        standing within the court it shall
                        defend. A player on each team shall be in
                        possession of a disc and prepared to
                        serve it. The server of the initiation
                        team must establish and maintain a
                        position in the court during the 3
                        seconds prior to the beginning of the
                        serving call. After the beginning of the
                        serving call, that player and all others
                        may move as they wish. Serves must be
                        made from within the court. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Service</i>: Upon a serving call
                        from the non-serving member of the
                        initiation team, play begins by a player
                        from each team throwing simultaneously.
                        Players on a team must alternate serves.
                        The serving call shall be a count of,
                        &quot;Ready, two, one, throw.&quot; There
                        shall be equal time intervals between
                        each word in the count. The total time of
                        the count shall not be shorter than 2
                        seconds nor longer than 3.5 seconds.
                        Servers must throw on the word
                        &quot;Throw,&quot; Immediately prior to
                        the serving call, the player making the
                        call shall announce the current game
                        score, giving the initiation team's score
                        first. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Incorrect Service</i>: If an
                        incorrect serving call is given, the
                        non-initiation team may call, &quot;Bad
                        call.&quot; If a server throws early, the
                        opponents may call, &quot;Early.&quot; If
                        a server throws late, the opponents may
                        call, &quot;Late.&quot; To be valid,
                        these calls must be made immediately. The
                        team making the call then may either take
                        any points they have scored on the
                        service, replay the service or if the
                        service resulted in both discs being
                        caught, they may play on after all
                        players are ready. <a href="#207">See
                        section 207</a> for the definition of the
                        &quot;play on&quot; procedure. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Incorrect Servers</i>: If any
                        player realizes that a service took place
                        using incorrect servers, he or she must
                        call, &quot;Wrong servers,&quot;
                        immediately. If the call is made before
                        either: a serve touches the ground, or
                        before a subsequent throw in the
                        exchange: the service must be redone
                        correctly regardless of the outcome of
                        the service. Otherwise, play continues to
                        the conclusion of the exchange with
                        points scored being duly awarded.
                        Regardless, the next service in the match
                        shall return to the correct serving
                        combination. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Initiation</i>: The initiation on
                        the first exchange of a game shall be
                        determined as per <a href="#204.01">section
                        204.01(A)</a>. On subsequent exchanges
                        and replays in a game, the initiation
                        team shall be the team having won the
                        previous point. In matches of more than
                        one game, the initiation team on the
                        first exchange of each new game shall be
                        the team having won the previous game. </li>
                    <li>G. <i>Serving Combinations</i>: The
                        serving combinations for the first game
                        of a match shall be determined as per <a
                        href="#204.01">section 204.01 (A)</a>. In
                        matches of more than one game, the
                        serving combinations shall alternate from
                        one game to the next; i.e., if player A
                        of team A/B and player C of team C/D were
                        a serving combination in the first game,
                        player A should serve against player D
                        and player B should serve against player
                        C in the second game. In the first
                        exchange after any alternation of serving
                        combinations, the initiation team
                        declares its server. </li>
                    <li>H. <i>Court Switches</i>: During a game,
                        teams shall switch courts after every
                        five points total are accumulated. In
                        matches of more than one game, the team
                        losing the previous game has its choice
                        of court for the next game in the match. </li>
                    <li>I. <i>Time Outs</i>: Time out periods
                        shall be 1 minute in duration and may be
                        called by either team between exchanges.
                        Each team is permitted 1 time out per
                        game. </li>
                    <li>J. <i>Pace of Play</i>: After the end of
                        an exchange and determination of points,
                        teams shall retrieve their discs without
                        delay and prepare to serve. The
                        initiation team must begin the serving
                        call within 10 seconds after all players
                        are ready. Breaks between games in a
                        match shall not exceed 3 minutes in
                        duration. Breaks between scheduled
                        matches in a round shall not exceed 5
                        minutes in duration. These time limits
                        are to serve as general guidelines for
                        the normal pace of play. Special
                        situations such as weather conditions may
                        require consideration. </li>

    </li>
    <li><a name="204.02"></a>204.02 <u>Play</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>General Procedure</i>: Both discs shall be
                used during the exchange. Play is accomplished
                by: <ul>
                    <li>(1) the players attempting to throw a
                        disc into the opponents' court such that
                        it lands with a legal angle and stops
                        without ever having touched
                        out-of-bounds; or, </li>
                    <li>(2) the players attempting to cause both
                        discs to be touched simultaneously by a
                        player or players on the opposing team. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Play continues until a disc touches
                out-of-bounds, stops dead in the court, or until
                both discs are touched simultaneously by a player
                or players on one team. If a disc touches the
                ground inside the court and is then touched by a
                player prior to the point being determined, the
                point is scored for the opponent. </p>
            </li>
            <li>B. <i>The Impasse</i>: When ever during an
                exchange a player on each team holds a disc an
                impasse occurs. It is the responsibility of the
                initiation team to throw within 4 seconds of the
                time the impasse occurred, unless their opponents
                choose to break the impasse by throwing. If the
                initiation team fails to initiate correctly, the
                opponents may call, &quot;Stalling.&quot; <a
                href="#204.07">See section 204.07</a> for the
                call procedure. </li>
            <li>C. <i>Deformation</i>: When a court or disc is
                deformed during the exchange, either team may
                call, &quot;Court,&quot; or, &quot;Disc,&quot; to
                request that the court be restored to its
                official shape, or the disc be replaced at the
                next impasse. After restoration or replacement,
                play may continue with all players ready and in
                their respective court positions which they held
                at the impasse. <a href="#207">See section 207</a>
                for the definition of the &quot;play on&quot;
                procedure. </li>
            <li>D. <i>Interference</i>: Should a disc or player
                be interfered with by the actions of an outside
                agent, such as a spectator or animal, a replay of
                the exchange will be allowed if it is determined
                that play was altered by the interference. </li>
            <li>E. <i>Coaching</i>: Coaching of players shall not
                be permitted during the exchange. Other coaching
                is permitted provided the pace-of-play rules are
                not violated. </li>
            <li>F. <i>Courtesy Signals</i>: Certain situations
                occur during a game when a signal would clarify
                the play for the opponents and the officials. The
                following non-mandatory courtesy signals should
                be used when these situations occur: <ul>
                    <li>(1) When the exchange has just ended and
                        a disc has touched near the boundary line
                        where the officials or the opponents may
                        be unsure if the disc was in or out, the
                        following signals should be used. If the
                        disc was out, the player should point an
                        arm and finger at a 45 degree angle up
                        and away from the center of the court. If
                        the disc was in, the player should point
                        an arm and finger at a 45 degree angle
                        down and toward the center of the court. </li>
                    <li>(2) When a team calls a double and the
                        opposing team agrees with the call, they
                        should indicate the acknowledged double
                        touch by displaying two fingers in a
                        manner known as the &quot;victory&quot;
                        or &quot;peace&quot; sign. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="204.03"></a>204.03 <u>Throwing</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>Court Position</i>: A player's court
                position is a 1 m diameter circle centered
                directly under the center ofhis or her hips.
                Court position is established at the coincidence
                of a catch and contact with the ground. Should
                the disc be caught out-of-bounds, the court
                position is centered at the nearest point inside
                the court from the point where it was caught. If
                momentum carries a player closer to the
                opponents' court after a catch and ground
                contact, the player must back-step the forward
                distance gained in order to establish a court
                position. If momentum carries a player in any
                direction not closer to the opponents' court, the
                court position will be established where the
                player stops. A player moving laterally or toward
                the rear of the court while making a catch, may
                throw before establishing a court position only
                if the throw is made prior to the player making 3
                ground contacts after the catch. Other than the
                serve, each throw must be made with a supporting
                point on the court position or with no part of
                the thrower in contact with the ground, in which
                case the last contact with the ground must have
                been at the court position. </li>
            <li>B. <i>Traveling</i>: A player has traveled if all
                contact with the court position is removed and
                subsequent ground contact is made elsewhere while
                still holding the disc. If a player throws after
                traveling, the opponents may call,
                &quot;Traveling.&quot; <a href="#20407">See
                section 204.07</a> for call procedure. </li>
            <li>C. <i>Line Faults</i>: If a thrower is legally on
                the court position and in contact with the
                boundary line during a throw, the opponents may
                call, &quot;Line fault.&quot; <a href="#20407">See
                section 204.07</a> for call procedure. </li>
            <li>D. <i>Throws From Out-of-Bounds</i>: Throws made
                with a supporting point completely out-of-bounds,
                or, from mid-air with the last supporting point
                contact having been out-of-bounds, are scored for
                the opponent. A throw made after a throw from
                out-of-bounds is considered a late throw. <a
                href="#204.03">See section 204.03</a> G. </li>
            <li>E. <i>Landing-Angle Restrictions</i>: All throws
                must strike the ground at an angle of 30 degrees
                or less from horizontal except for a throw that
                rolls away from the thrower upon initial ground
                contact and is under 2.5 m as it passes the
                opponents' front line. When it appears that a
                disc will hit the ground with illegal angle, the
                non-throwing team may call, &quot;Angle.&quot;
                This call must be made prior to the disc hitting
                the ground. <a href="#204.07">See section 204.07</a>
                for call procedure. <img src="image2_2.gif"

                2.2 </li>
            <li>F. <i>Endangerment: </i>If a player is hit above
                the knees by a high velocity shot while he or she
                is in position to play a lead shot, the defending
                team may call, &quot;Endangerment,&quot; and a
                replay is taken. If it is determined that the
                defending player intentionally moved into the
                shot, there is no replay and the exchange is
                scored under the usual rules. </li>
            <li>G. <i>Late Throws</i>: Competitive throws made
                after a point has been scored are considered to
                be late and may not score for the thrower.
                However, late throws shall be scored for the
                opponents of the throwing team if the throw goes
                out-of-bounds. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="204.04"></a>204.04 <u>Catching</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>General Procedure</i>: A player may use one
                or both hands to catch a disc. Legal catches
                include, in addition to the standard catches,
                those that are made with simultaneous contact
                with the ground or boundary lines, those that are
                made with simultaneous contact between teammates,
                and those that are made without the use of hands,
                such as body traps. A player may catch a disc
                that has been tipped or bobbled by a teammate. A
                disc caught simultaneously by both players on a
                team may be thrown by either player. </li>
            <li>B. <i>Double-Touch</i>: If a player or team
                touches both discs at the same time or uses a
                disc in their possession to touch the other disc,
                a &quot;double-touch&quot; has been committed.
                When the attacking team observes what they
                believe to be a double-touch by their opponents,
                they may call, &quot;Two,&quot; immediately after
                the assumed double. If the defending team agrees
                with the call, play stops and 2 points are scored
                for the attacking team. If the defending team
                does not agree, they must call, &quot;No,&quot;
                immediately after the call of, &quot;Two,&quot;
                and play on without interruption until the next
                impasse or undisputed score occurs. At that time
                players must maintain their court position and
                any disputed calls shall be discussed and
                determined in the order in which they occurred.
                If a disputed call is resolved such that a point
                or points are scored, the exchange is ended. If,
                however, it is determined that none of the
                disputed calls result in a point or points
                scored, then either: any undisputed points which
                have been scored are awarded, or play should
                continue after all players are ready. <a
                href="#207">See section 207</a> for the
                definition of the &quot;play on&quot; procedure.
                In games using observers, the observer for the
                court is to call, &quot;Double,&quot; or,
                &quot;Clean,&quot; immediately after any disputed
                call. A confirming call of &quot;Double,&quot;
                ends the exchange and a call of
                &quot;Clean,&quot; indicates that the exchange is
                not to be affected by the erroneous double call. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="204.05"></a>204.05 <u>Tipping</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>General Procedure</i>: Tipping is a
                standard method of escaping double touch
                situations and is usually done with the first
                disc touched by a team. Except in escape
                situations, teams are allowed only one tip. An
                escape situation occurs when both discs are
                thrown at the same court. Violations of this rule
                constitute traveling. <a href="#204.07">See
                section 204.07</a> for call procedure. In all
                non-catching contacts, the disc must be sharply
                struck. Tips and air-brushes are legal provided
                the disc is not held in prolonged contact or
                lifted while being touched. Any prolonged contact
                with the disc, including a delay or an illegal
                tip, constitutes a catch. </li>
            <li>B. <i>Two-Handed Tips</i>: Two-handed tips and
                air-brushes must comply with <a href="#204.05">section
                204.05(A)</a> and meet the additional restriction
                that no pair of opposite sides of the disc are
                touched simultaneously. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="204.06"></a>204.06 <u>Scoring</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>General Procedures</i>: Whenever a thrown
                disc comes to rest completely inside the court,
                having landed at a legal angle, and having never
                touched out of-bounds, a point is scored by the
                team attacking that court. Whenever a thrown disc
                touches any out-of-bounds area, a point is scored
                by the opponents of the team that last touched
                the disc. A disc which comes to rest inside the
                court and which is breaking the vertical plane of
                the inside edge of the boundary line, but not
                touching it, is considered out-of-bounds. A point
                is scored by the opposing team whenever, during
                play: <ul>
                    <li>(1) a thrown disc is touched and dropped
                        by a player; </li>
                    <li>(2) a player touches his or her own throw
                        or a teammate's throw; </li>
                    <li>(3) a player hands the disc to a
                        teammate. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whenever a player or team touches both discs
                simultaneously during play, two points are scored
                by the opposing team. </p>
            </li>
            <li>B. <i>The Break</i>: Whenever both discs land and
                the result is a scoring situation against each
                team, a break occurs. No points are scored and
                play is restarted, using the other serving
                combination of the game. </li>
            <li>C. <i>Mid-Air Contact</i>: If the two discs make
                mid-air contact at any time, a point will be
                scored by the opponents for each disc that lands
                and stops in a team's court. If a player or team
                touches one or two discs after the contact, which
                they subsequently fail to catch, their opponents
                receive a point for each dropped disc, in or out
                of the court. After mid-air contact, no further
                throws may be made and the landing-angle
                restriction and double-touch rules do not apply
                for the remainder of the exchange. A replay is
                taken when no points are scored, or when the
                result is a point scored against each team. </li>

    <li><a name="204.07"></a>204.07 <u>Infractions</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>General Procedur</i>e: In order to make a
                call of an infraction (traveling, line fault, or
                stalling), the call must be made during or
                immediately after the occurrence. The angle
                infraction call must be made prior to the disc
                hitting the ground. If the team on which the call
                is made accepts the call as valid, play stops
                immediately with any throws made after the
                occurrence being of no consequence. The team
                making the call then may either: <ul>
                    <li>(1) dismiss the infraction with any
                        points that have been scored in the
                        exchange being awarded without
                        consideration of an infraction; or, </li>
                    <li>(2) charge their opponents with an
                        infraction and replay the exchange. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>On the third and subsequent instances of a
                team being charged with any combination of
                infractions in a game, the team not committing
                the infraction is also awarded one point if they
                choose the replay option. </p>
            </li>
            <li>B. <i>Disputed Calls</i>: If a player disagrees
                with an infraction call, that player must call,
                &quot;No,&quot; immediately following the
                infraction call and play continues without
                interruption until the next impasse or undisputed
                score occurs. At that time, players must maintain
                their court positions and any disputed calls
                shall be discussed and determined in the order in
                which they occurred. If a call is determined to
                be valid, the team making the call then chooses
                from the options listed under <a href="#204.07">section
                204.07(A)</a>. If no calls are determined to be
                valid, then either the undisputed points which
                have been scored are awarded, or play continues
                after all players are ready. <a href="#207">See
                section 207</a> for the definition of the
                &quot;play on&quot; procedure. </li>
            <li>C. <i>Offsetting Infractions</i>: In the event
                that one or more valid infraction calls are made
                against each team during the same exchange, the
                infractions shall be considered to offset one
                another. The exchange is to be replayed with no
                infraction being charged to either team. </li>
