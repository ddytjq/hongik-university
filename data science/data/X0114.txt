<p><u>Comment</u>: Ultimate is a team sport in which the team
with the higher point total at the end of the game wins. It is
played with two teams of seven players on a rectangular field
with an endzone at each end. A goal, worth 1 point, is scored
when a player/thrower passes the disc to a teammate and it is
successfully caught within the confines of the endzone his or her
team is attacking. The disc may be advanced solely by passing the
disc from one player to another. A player may not run while in
possession of the disc. While the team in possession of the disc
seeks to advance the disc toward the endzone it is attacking, the
opposing team seeks to thwart advancement and obtain possession
by forcing a turnover. A turnover results whenever a pass is
incomplete, caught or knocked down by an opposing player, touches
the ground at any point or is caught by a player out-of-bounds.
No overt contact or tackling is allowed. The sport is played on a
self-officiated basis, with no referees. All line violation,
possession and foul calls are made by the players on the playing
field.</p>

    <li><a name="401"></a><b>401 Spirit of the Game</b>: Ultimate
        has traditionally relied upon a spirit of sportsmanship
        which places the responsibility for fair play on the
        individual player himself. Highly competitive play is
        encouraged but never at the expense of mutual respect
        between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of
        the game or the basic joy of play. The purpose of the
        rules of ultimate is to provide a guideline which
        describes the way the game is played. It is assumed that
        no ultimate player will intentionally violate the rules;
        there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions
        but, rather, a method for resuming play in a manner which
        simulates what would most likely have occurred had there
        been no infraction. </li>
    <li><a name="402"></a><b>402 Field of Play</b> <ul>
            <li><a name="402.01"></a>402.01 <u>Dimensions</u>:
                The field of play consists of a 70 yd by 40 yd
                rectangle (approximately 64 m x 37 m) called the
                playing field, with a 25 yd by 40 yd rectangle
                (approximately 23 m x 37 m) called an endzone
                aligned along each of the 40 yd (37 m) sides. See
                figure 4.1. <img src="image4_1.gif" align="top"
                vspace="20" width="427" height="237"> </li>
            <li><a name="402.02"></a>402.02 <u>Surface</u>: The
                playing field may have any surface, although well
                trimmed grass is suggested, which is essentially
                flat, free of obstructions and holes, and affords
                reasonable player safety. </li>
            <li><a name="402.03"></a>402.03 <u>Goal Lines</u>:
                Goal lines are lines which separate the playing
                field proper from the endzones and are part of
                the playing field proper. </li>
            <li><a name="402.04"></a>402.04 <u>Perimeter Lines</u>:
                Perimeter lines (sidelines and endlines) are
                lines separating the playing field from the
                out-of-bounds area and are not part of the
                playing field. </li>
            <li><a name="402.05"></a>402.05 <u>Markers</u>: The
                corners of the playing field proper and the
                endzones are marked by cones made of a brightly
                colored, flexible material. </li>
            <li><a name="402.06"></a>402.06 <u>Restraining Line</u>:
                A restraining line shall be established 5 m from
                the playing field to ensure that the sidelines
                remain clear during play. </li>
            <li><a name="402.07"></a>402.07 <u>Line Markings</u>:
                All lines shall be marked with a non-caustic
                material and shall be between 2 in and 4 in
                (approximately 5 cm and 10 cm) wide. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="403"></a><b>403 Equipment</b> <ul>
            <li><a name="403.01"></a>403.01 <u>Disc</u>: Any
                flying disc may be used as long as it is
                acceptable to both team captains and meets the
                requirements set forth in Article I of the WFDF
                rules. If the captains cannot agree, a disc
                designated by the WFDF Ultimate Committee as an
                official disc for the event shall be used. If no
                such disc has been designated, any disc
                designated by the WFDF Ultimate Committee as an
                approved disc for ultimate play shall be used. If
                the teams cannot agree upon a specific approved
                disc for play, two options are available: <ul>
                    <li>(1) each team shall supply one approved
                        disc for one half of the game using the
                        disc flipping method <a
                        href="art1.htm#104.03">(104.03)</a> to
                        determine the order of use; or; </li>
                    <li>(2) if that solution is not acceptable to
                        both teams they shall resolve the
                        disagreement through the disc flipping
                        method. The team winning the flip shall
                        then supply the approved disc for the
                        entire game. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a name="403.02"></a>403.02 <u>Protective
                Clothing</u>: Players may wear any soft
                protective clothing so long as it does not
                endanger the safety of any other player. </li>
            <li><a name="403.03"></a>403.03 <u>Uniform</u>: The
                players of each team shall wear a uniform or
                other clothing that distinguishes them from the
                players of the other team. </li>
            <li><a name="403.04"></a>403.04 <u>Cleats</u>: Cleats
                are permitted; however, players may not use any
                cleats which have any metal exposed. </li>
        </ul>

            <li><a name="404.01"></a>404.01 <u>Rule Variations</u>:
                Any of these rules may be changed by mutual
                agreement of the captains of the two teams,
                subject to the approval of the tournament
                director. </li>
            <li><a name="404.02"></a>404.02 <u>Length of Game</u>:
                A game lasts until one team reaches a score of at
                least 21 goals with a lead of at least two goals,
                or until a team scores 25 goals. A 10 minute
                halftime occurs the first time either team
                reaches 11 goals. </li>
            <li><a name="404.03"></a>404.03 <u>Time Outs</u>: <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Non-Injury</i>: Each team is
                        permitted two non-injury time-outs per
                        half in games to 17 or less, and three
                        non-injury time outs per half in games to
                        18 or more. Each team is permitted
                        exactly one time-out in overtime.
                        Overtime occurs when the score is tied at
                        one point less than the number of points
                        for which the game was originally
                        scheduled. <ul>
                            <li>(1) Time to Call: A time-out may
                                be called by either team, after a
                                goal and prior to the ensuing
                                throw-off, or may be called by
                                the player in possession of the

                            <li>(2) Duration: Time-outs shall not
                                exceed 2 minutes in length. </li>
                            <li>(3) Signal: A player or captain
                                calling time-out must form a

                        out-of-bounds area or contacts anything
                        which is out-of-bounds. The disc in
                        flight may pass over an out-of-bounds
                        area and return to the playing field
                        without being declared out-of-bounds so
                        long as it does not contact an
                        out-of-bounds area or anything which is

                        players may go out-of-bounds to make a
                        play on the disc. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Receiving Players</i>: Receiving
                        players may not go out-of-bounds to make
                        a play on the disc. For a receiver to be
                        considered in-bounds at the time of
                        gaining possession of the disc, the
                        player's first point of contact with the
                        ground must be completely in-bounds. If
                        any portion of the first point of contact
                        is out-of-bounds, the player is

                        is in or out-of-bounds is determined by
                        where he or she last contacted the
                        ground. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Momentum</i>: In the event the

                        out-of-bounds after making an in-bounds
                        reception, the player is considered
                        in-bounds. The player shall resume play
                        at the point he or she went

                        the disc has gone out-of-bounds, a player
                        of the team gaining possession of the

                        the playing field proper closest to the
                        point where the disc went over the
                        perimeter line, and establish a pivot
                        foot at that point, not within the
                        perimeter line, before putting the disc
                        into play. The opposing team gains
                        possession of the disc where it left the
                        field of play only if the defense did not
                        subsequently contact the disc. If the
                        defense contacted the disc, the disc must
                        be put into play at the point on the
                        playing field proper closest to where the

                        obtains possession in the endzone which
                        it is defending, the player taking
                        possession must make the immediate
                        decision to either put the disc into play
                        from the point he or she took possession
                        or carry it directly to the closest point
                        on the goal line from the point he or she
                        took possession and put it into play from
                        there. If the latter option is chosen,
                        the player taking possession may not
                        throw a pass until he or she is at the

                                putting the disc into play at the

                                defending, that player may not
                                carry the disc to the goal line,
                                but shall put the disc into play
                                from the point of possession. </li>

                        gains possession by interception in the
                        endzone which it is attacking, the player
                        taking possession shall carry the disc
                        directly to the closest point on the goal
                        line, from the point of possession, and

                        attacking. </li>
                    <li>B. In order for the receiver to be
                        considered in the endzone at the time he
                        or she gains possession, his or her first

                        from that point. </li>
                    <li>D. A player must be completely in the
                        endzone and acknowledge that he or she
                        has scored a goal. If that player plays
                        the disc unknowingly into a turnover,
                        then no goal is awarded. </li>

                        left. However, the thrower catching his
                        or her own throw shall not result in a

                    <li>A. A player may become &quot;the
                        thrower&quot; by fielding a pull,
                        receiving the disc from a teammate,
                        intercepting a pass from an opponent, or
                        by picking up the disc after a turnover.
                        Whenever the disc is on the ground
                        following a turnover, whether in or
                        out-of-bounds, any player becoming
                        offense may take possession of the disc
                        and become the thrower. A defensive
                        player who establishes possession of the
                        disc becomes the thrower, but may not
                        throw the disc before he or she
                        establishes a legal pivot foot. To do so
                        is a travelling violation. </li>
                    <li>B. Prior to releasing a throw, the
                        thrower must establish a pivot foot and
                        may not change that pivot foot until the
                        throw is released except in the case of
                        an offensive player who has just received
                        a pass and is throwing before the third
                        ground contact in accordance with <a
                        href="#404.12">404.12(C)</a>. The thrower
                        has the right to pivot off the pivot foot
                        in any direction. However, once the
                        marker has established a legal position,
                        the thrower may not pivot into him. The
                        thrower may throw the disc in any manner
                        and in any direction he or she chooses. </li>
                    <li>C. In the event the disc is dropped by
                        the thrower without defensive
                        interference, it is considered an
                        incomplete pass. </li>

            <li><a name="404.11"></a>404.11 <u>The Marker</u>: <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Guarding</i>: At any time, only one
                        defensive player may guard the thrower. A
                        player is said to be guarding the thrower
                        if he or she is within 3 m of the
                        thrower's pivot foot and is not within 3
                        m of any other member of the offensive
                        team. A thrower guarded by more than one
                        defender shall call, &quot;Double
                        team.&quot; The first time this occurs
                        during any one count, the marker should
                        immediately subtract 2 seconds from the
                        count and continue without interruption.
                        The second time this occurs is a foul and
                        the count shall be reset to zero with a
                        check. <ul>
                            <li>(1) When guarding the thrower,
                                the marker may not straddle the
                                pivot foot of the thrower. </li>
                            <li>(2) When guarding the thrower,
                                the upper body of the marker must
                                be at least one disc's diameter
                                from the upper body of the
                                thrower at all times. It is the
                                mutual responsibility of both
                                players to respect each other's
                                position and not encroach into
                                the other's area once it is
                                established. </li>
                            <li>(3) When guarding the thrower,
                                the marker cannot position his or
                                her arms in such a manner as to
                                restrict the thrower from
                                pivoting. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Stalling</i>: Once a marker is
                        within 3 m of the thrower, he or she may
                        initiate a count. This consists of the
                        marker calling, &quot;Stalling,&quot; and
                        then counting at one second intervals to
                        ten. If the thrower has not released the
                        disc by the first sound of the word
                        &quot;ten,&quot; then a change of
                        possession with a check shall result. If
                        during the stall count, the defense
                        switches markers, the new marker must
                        begin a new count at zero. In the event
                        of a stall, the once-marker, now
                        offensive player, does not have to take
                        the disc after the check. The
                        once-thrower, now marker, checks the disc
                        to the new thrower. If he or she does not
                        want the disc, the marker
                        &quot;checks&quot; the disc by placing it
                        on the ground and calling &quot;In
                        play.&quot; </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Resumption of Count After Foul</i>:
                        If a marker's stalling count is
                        interrupted by a call being made, after
                        the call is resolved the stalling count
                        shall be resumed in the following manner:
                        <ul>
                            <li>(1) If the call was against the
                                defense, the count shall be reset
                                to zero, unless contested and
                                over five, in which case it
                                resumes at five (&quot;Stalling,
                                six...&quot;). </li>
                            <li>(2) If the call was against the
                                offense, the count continues from
                                the point of interruption. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Resumption of Count After Time-out</i>:
                        When play resumes after a time-out, the
                        stall count shall continue from the point
                        of interruption </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Fast Count</i>: If the marker
                        counts too fast, the thrower may call,
                        &quot;Fast count.&quot; The first time
                        this occurs during any one count, the
                        marker should immediately subtract two
                        seconds from the count and continue
                        without interruption. The second time
                        this occurs is a foul and the count shall
                        reset to zero with a check. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Contested Stall</i>: The thrower
                        may contest a stall call if he or she
                        believes that he or she had released the
                        disc before the first utterance of the
                        word &quot;ten.&quot; <ul>
                            <li>(1) In the event of a contested
                                stall, if the pass is completed,
                                play stops and possession reverts
                                back to the thrower. After a
                                check, the marker starts the
                                stall count at eight. </li>
                            <li>(2) In the event of a contested
                                stall, if the pass is incomplete,
                                it is a turnover and play
                                continues without interruption. </li>
                        </ul>

            <li><a name="404.12"></a>404.12 <u>The Receiver</u>: <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Possession</i>: A receiver gains
                        possession by demonstrating sustained
                        contact and control of a non-spinning
                        disc while the receiver is on the ground
                        and in-bounds. Loss of control due to
                        ground contact related to a pass
                        reception negates that receivers
                        possession up to that point. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Bobbling</i>: Bobbling to gain
                        control of the disc is permitted, but
                        purposeful, controlled bobbling to
                        oneself in order to advance the disc is
                        considered traveling and is not allowed.
                        For purposes of this section, bobbling
                        shall include tipping, delaying, guiding
                        or brushing the disc. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Traveling</i>: If the receiver is
                        moving when he or she catches a pass, he
                        or she shall be permitted the fewest
                        number of steps required to come to a
                        stop and establish a pivot foot. Further,
                        a receiver who catches the disc while
                        running or jumping may continue to run
                        and throw a pass so long as the throw is
                        released prior to the receiver making
                        three contacts with the ground and that
                        he or she makes no change in direction or
                        increase in speed during his or her
                        tenure of possession. Violation of this
                        section shall constitute traveling <a
                        href="#404.16">(see 404.16(C))</a>. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Simultaneous Catch</i>: If the disc
                        is caught simultaneously by offensive and
                        defensive players, the offense retains
                        possession. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Interception:</i> A pass is
                        considered intercepted if a defensive
                        player catches a pass. If a defensive
                        player catches a pass and accidentally
                        loses possession of it before or during
                        ground contact related to that catch, the
                        defender is considered to have blocked
                        rather than intercepted the pass. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Judging</i>: If a pass arrives in
                        such a manner that it is unclear whether
                        a catch was made before the disc made
                        contact with the ground (grass is
                        considered part of the ground), the
                        player with the best perspective shall
                        decide whether a good catch was made.
                        Further, if it is unclear whether a
                        receiver was in or out-of-bounds at the
                        point of making a catch, the player or
                        players with the best perspective makes
                        the call. </li>
                    <li>G. <i>Force-Out Foul</i>: If a receiver
                        is airborne at the time he or she takes
                        possession of the disc, and prior to
                        landing is contacted by a defensive
                        player, and said contact causes the
                        receiver to land out-of-bounds, the
                        receiver shall either call himself
                        out-of-bounds or call a force-out foul on
                        the defensive player. If this foul occurs
                        in the end zone and it is uncontested, a
                        goal is awarded. </li>

                        initiating contact shall be the player
                        guilty of the foul. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Throwing Fouls</i>: A throwing foul
                        may be called when there is contact
                        between the thrower and the marker, prior
                        to the release of the disc by the
                        thrower. Contact occurring during the
                        thrower's follow through is not
                        sufficient grounds for a foul, but should
                        still be avoided whenever possible. <ul>
                            <li>(1) When a foul is committed by
                                the thrower or the marker, play
                                stops and possession reverts back
                                to the thrower, after a check. </li>
                            <li>(2) If the thrower is fouled in
                                the act of throwing and the pass
                                is completed, the foul is
                                automatically declined and play
                                continues without interruption. </li>
                            <li>(3) If the marker is fouled
                                during the thrower's act of
                                throwing and the pass is not
                                completed, play continues without
                                interruption. If the pass is
                                completed, the disc is returned
                                to the thrower after a check and
                                the stall count is resumed from
                                the point of interruption. </li>
                            <li>(4) Should a foul or violation
                                result in possession reverting to
                                a thrower who was airborne while
                                releasing the disc, play shall be
                                restarted at the point on the
                                playing field proper closest to
                                the location from which the throw
                                was made. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Catching Fouls</i>: A catching foul
                        may be called when there is contact
                        between opposing players in the process
                        of attempting a catch, interception or
                        knock down. A certain amount of
                        incidental contact during or immediately
                        after the catching attempt is often
                        unavoidable and shall not constitute a
                        foul. <ul>
                            <li>(1) Interference: If a player
                                makes contact with an opponent
                                before the disc arrives and
                                therefore interferes with that
                                opponent's attempt to make a play
                                on the disc, that player has
                                committed a foul. </li>
                            <li>(2) If a player's attempt to make
                                a play on the disc causes contact
                                with a legitimately-positioned,
                                stationary opponent, either
                                before or after the disc arrives,
                                that player has committed a foul.
                            </li>
                            <li>(3) If a catching foul occurs and
                                is uncontested, the player fouled
                                gains possession at the point of
                                the infraction. If the call is
                                disputed, possession of the disc
                                reverts back to the thrower. If
                                an uncontested foul, with the
                                exception of a force-out foul <a
                                href="#404.12">(see 404.12 (F))</a>,

                                offensive team is attacking, the
                                player fouled gains possession at
                                the closest point on the goal
                                line to the infraction. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Aggressive Behavior</i>:
                        Dangerously aggressive behavior or
                        reckless disregard for the safety of
                        fellow players shall constitute a foul. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Player Positioning</i>: After a
                        foul is called, all players shall remain
                        in the position they held at the time of
                        the foul until play is resumed. </li>

            <li><a name="404.14"></a>404.14 <u>Positioning</u>: <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Right to Position</i>: Every
                        player, with the exception of the thrower
                        as set forth in <a href="#404.10">section
                        404.10(B)</a>, is entitled to occupy any
                        position on the field not occupied by any
                        opposing player, provided that he or she
                        does not cause personal contact in taking
                        such a position. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Avoiding Contact</i>: It is always
                        the responsibility of all players to
                        avoid contact in any way possible.
                        Violent impact with
                        legitimately-positioned opponents
                        constitutes harmful endangerment, is a
                        foul and must be strictly avoided. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Picks</i>: No player may establish
                        a position, or move in such a manner, so
                        as to obstruct the movement of any player
                        on the opposing team. In the event of a
                        pick, the obstructed player shall
                        immediately call &quot;Pick,&quot;
                        loudly. Play shall then be stopped and be
                        resumed only after a check, with the
                        stall count resuming from the point of
                        interruption or to five if the count is
                        over five. The continuation rule applies
                        only to the next catch after the pick
                        call. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Principal of Verticality</i>: All
                        players shall have the right to the space
                        immediately above them. Accordingly, a
                        player cannot prevent an opponent from
                        attempting to catch a pass by placing his
                        or her arms above an opponent. If a
                        player so places his or her arms, and
                        contact occurs, a foul may be called. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Playing the Disc</i>: Whenever the
                        disc is in the air, all players shall
                        play the disc in lieu of the opponent. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Rights of Players Off the Ground</i>:
                        A player who has jumped is entitled to
                        land at the same point without hindrance
                        by opponents. He or she may also land at
                        another point provided the landing point
                        was not already occupied at the time of
                        his or her takeoff and if the direct path
                        between the takeoff and landing point was
                        not already occupied at the time of

                    <li>A. At their discretion, the captains may,
                        before the game, decide to select up to
                        six experienced individuals, who are not
                        participating in the game, to act as
                        observers. The duty of the observer is to
                        carefully watch the action of the game
                        for the sole purpose of rendering a
                        decision in the event of a dispute that
                        cannot be resolved. Observers shall

                        calls on their own initiative. </li>
                    <li>B. When a dispute arises which cannot be
                        resolved by the players involved or their
                        captains, the observers may be called
                        upon by the captains to make the call.
                        The observer with the best view of the
                        play makes the call. If the observers so
                        choose, they may discuss the play among
                        themselves before rendering a decision. </li>
                    <li>C. By calling in the observers, the teams
                        agree to abide by the observers'
                        decision. </li>

                        recognizes that a violation has occurred.
                        The player should immediately call,

                    <li>C. <i>Traveling</i>: Any journey by a
                        player while in possession of the disc
                        which is in violation of these rules
                        constitutes a travel and is not
                        permitted. <ul>
                            <li>(1) At all times a thrower must

                            <li>(3) If a receiver, after

                        infringement of the rules or a time-out
                        occurs, play is halted and the disc is
                        put back into play with a check at the
                        point of the last possession before play
                        was stopped, except as otherwise provided

                            <li>(2) If the team who would receive
                                the benefit of the call gains
                                possession as a result of a pass
                                committed prior or during the
                                time the call was made, play
                                shall continue unhalted. It is
                                the responsibility of the player
                                who made the call to call out,
                                &quot;Play on,&quot; to indicate

                        failure to come to an agreement over any
                        call, the disc shall be returned to the
                        last thrower prior to the dispute via a
                        check. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Offsetting Fouls</i>: If offsetting
                        catching fouls are called by offensive
                        and defensive players on the same play,
                        the disc shall be returned to the last
                        thrower at his or her point of possession
                        via a check. </li>

                        the player who commits the foul should
                        inform the infracted player of the foul. </li>
                    <li>B. It is the responsibility of both teams
                        to minimize the time used between each
                        goal and the ensuing throw-off. </li>
                    <li>C. If the receiving team wishes to have a
                        throw-off which traveled out-of-bounds
                        rethrown, said team should give the
                        rethrow signal as soon as possible. </li>
                    <li>D. In the event a dispute or confusion
                        arises on the field, play should be
                        stopped and subsequently resumed via a
                        check after the matter is resolved. </li>
                    <li>E. In non-tournament play, where a novice
                        player commits a violation due to
                        ignorance of the rules, it shall be
                        common practice to stop play and explain
                        the violation and the rule to the player.
