<center><h2>Section 7.4: Protect your Private Parts</h2></center>
<p>

At the beginning of Section 7, we used the following example of a
class declaration:

<pre>
class Player {
  int health;
  int strength;
  int agility;

  void move();
  void attackMonster();
  void getTreasure();
};
</pre>

Although this is perfectly legal C++, we left out an important part of
class declarations to simplify the example.  Every data member and
member function in a class is either <code>private</code>,
<code>public</code>, or <code>protected</code>.  We'll explain the
meaning of each in this chapter.

</p>

<h3> Private </h3>

<p>

Specifying that a data member or member function is
<code>private</code> means that it can only be accessed from
within the class.  For data members, this means that the data can be
accessed or modified only while inside a member function of the class.
For member functions, this means that the function can be called only
while inside another member function of the class.  This is the
default, if no specifiers are used.

</p>


<h3>  Public </h3>

<p>

Specifying that a data member or member function is
<code>public</code> means that it can be accessed from anywhere
in your code.  The <code>public</code> specifier is less restrictive
than <code>private</code>.

</p>

<h3> Protected </h3>

<p>

Specifying that a data member or member function is
<code>protected</code> means that it can only be accessed from within
the class or a subclass.  We haven't yet talked about subclasses
(Section 10), so don't worry about using <code>protected</code> just
yet.  The <code>protected</code> specifier is less restrictive than
<code>private</code> but more restrictive than <code>public</code>.

</p>

<h3> How do I use these specifiers? </h3>

<p>

Using <code>private</code>, <code>public</code>, and
<code>protected</code> are easy.  The specifier affects all data
members and member functions until the next occurrence of a specifier.
Here's the <code>Player</code> class, with protection specifiers
added:

<pre>
class Player {
private:
  int health;
  int strength;
  int agility;
public:
  void move();
  void attackMonster();
  void getTreasure();
};
</pre>


In this example, the <code>private</code> keyword begins a
<code>private</code> section encompassing the three data members.  The
<code>public</code> keyword specifies that the next three member
functions should be <code>public</code>.  So, only code which is in a
<code>Player</code> member function can access the data members, while
any code in the program is free to call the member functions in the
<code>Player</code> class.

</p>


<h3> Why bother with this stuff? </h3>

<p>

Specifiers allow a class to be very complex, with many member
functions and data members, while having a simple <i>public
interface</i> that other classes can use.  A class which has two
hundred data members and one hundred member functions can be very
complicated to write; but if there are only three or four
<code>public</code> member functions, and the rest are all
<code>private</code>, it can be easy for someone to learn how to use
the class.

He only needs to understand how to use a small handful of
<code>public</code> functions, and doesn't need to bother with the two
hundred data members, because he's not allowed to access this data.
He can only access the <code>private</code> data through the class'
public interface.

Without a doubt, in a small program, using these specifiers may seem
unnecessary.  However, they are worth understanding if you plan to do
any program of reasonable size (more than a couple hundred lines).  In
general, it is good practice to make data members
<code>private</code>.  Member functions which must be called from
outside the class should be <code>public</code>, and member functions
which are only called from within the class (also known as "helper
functions") should probably be <code>private</code>.  These specifiers
are especially useful in a large program involving more than one
programmer.
