<h3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE</H3>

<hr>

                To further the understanding of the structure and function of the microbial and plant
                community and interactions of components in natural and amended soil and
                subsurface habitats containing mixed contaminants and to elucidate their role in
                bioremediation.<p>
                <h3>BACKGROUND</H3>
                
                
<hr>
<hr><h4><i>Fundamental research is needed in community dynamics and microbial
ecology at both the molecular and the organismal level to better understand
bioremediation processes.</i></h4><hr>

Fundamental research in community dynamics and microbial and plant ecology at
both the molecular and the organismal level is needed to better understand the
natural intrinsic processes of bioremediation in mixed contaminant sites.  The
taxonomic scope of soil ecology includes viruses, prokaryotes, eukaryotic
microorganisms (such as fungi, protozoa, and microalgae), and metazoans including
nematodes, earthworms, and other microinvertebrates and their interactions with
plant roots. Carbon and electron flow through biological communities facilitates
degradation and transformation of organic and inorganic wastes. Our understanding
of these reactions must transcend taxonomic characterization and single-species
study from microorganisms through lower invertebrate communities populating
subsurface systems. A more complete understanding of energetics and
biogeochemical transformation at the community level may ultimately provide the
ability to control or stimulate communities capable of transformation and to channel
carbon flow (particularly of polluting organic compounds) through these
communities or populations. It is essential to understand the roles and
interactions of diverse communities in order to understand how and to
what extent the structure of the biological community influences the
course of bioremediation and to what extent the environmental factors
influence community dynamics in sites containing mixed contaminants. 
As this issue is addressed, then the Acceleration program element can
determine how to best augment and sustain the microbial activity
involved in remediation. <p>
<hr><h4><i>Traditional methods for identifying microorganisms and
assessing their activity in soil have limited applicability for
bioremediation.</i></h4><hr>

Genetic and phenotypic information is needed to better assess
community members.  Traditional methods for identifying
microorganisms and assessing their activity in soil, such as plating and
most probable number (MPN) techniques, have limited applicability for
bioremediation (Metting, 1992).  DNA and RNA molecular probes, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA, and genomic sequencing of ribosomal
RNA are being used to identify microorganisms or populations.  In addition,
fluorescence stains and antibodies, microautoradiography, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and microscopy are employed to monitor changes
in population types and numbers.  Although these techniques can identify a larger
number of phenotypes present in a soil sample than direct plating, they do not
account for biodiversity with respect to function of the organisms under
environmental stress, competition, or seasonal changes.  Both radioactive and stable
isotope technologies are being applied to measuring soil community respiration
activity along with methods to measure enzymatic activity.  Specific patterns of
phospholipid ester-linked fatty acids (PLFA) and formation of polyhydroxy butyrate
(PHB) can indicate physiological stress within the microbial community (Tunlid and
White, 1992).  However, we are still far from understanding or having the tools and
methods to provide cost-effective, real-time evaluation of metabolic activities and
physiology associated with bioremediation or to examine in detail changes in soil
populations over time to assess bioremediation activity.  Even the modeling used to
predict microbial activity has been developed more for bioreactors that function as
closed (batch) and open (continuous) systems than for applications in soils (Lynch
and Hobbie, 1988).<p>
<h3>APPROACH</H3>


<hr>
In open systems, such as those found at mixed-contaminant sites or in continuous-flow bioreactors, organisms selectively take in substances, usually in solution,
process these substances, and return products to the surrounding environment. 
Often the focus on bioremediation has been from an engineering point of view, i.e.,
to determine the mass balance (CISB, 1993).  However, in nature this continuous
process of "substrates in" and "end products out" is dynamic, and members of the
community are continuously changing in numbers and types.  Current approaches
to bioremediation focus on mass balance, providing quantitative descriptions of
initial and final concentrations as well as intermediates in selected cases. This gives
rise to the "black box" perception of bioremediation (Miller and Poindexter, 1994).
Basic research into community dynamics will provide a more complete
understanding of the path of carbon and electron flow through degrading and
transforming populations. This information will identify and quantify the signals and
switches at the molecular, cellular, and community level that lead to successional
changes required to induce and control bioremediation processes.  The approach of
this program element is to build upon the previous laboratory studies on bioremedial
capabilities of organisms and transfer this knowledge to study communities in field
research centers where mixed contaminants exist in a variety of types and
concentrations.  In the field research center it can be determined whether organisms
capable of bioremediation are widely dispersed, concentrated where the contaminant
levels are not toxic and diluted, or present where the contaminants are concentrated. 
Information is also needed to assess what organisms can degrade the
contaminants irrespective of their ability to be isolated or counted
(Miller and Poindexter, 1994).  Other factors that may influence
community bioremedial activities also need to be elucidated at both the
molecular and the organismal level, such as rates and mechanisms of
molecular evolution of expressed bioremedial genes and environmental
factors influencing bioavailability and rates of biotransformation and
biodegradation and the partitioning of contaminants within the geologic
medium. <p>
<hr><h4><i>Understanding the complex relationships and interactions
of all the organisms involved will improve prediction, assessment, and
optimization of bioremedial processes.</i></h4><hr>

Research in the Community Dynamics and Microbial Ecology program
element will be integrated with research in several other elements.  With
respect to Biomolecular Science and Engineering, Community Dynamics
will identify important prokaryote and eukaryote bioremedial
populations present within one or more damaged sites that may have
greater potential for bioremedial activity and genes for cloning or
biological molecules for overexpression.  Similarly, for the
Biotransformation and Biodegradation element, Community Dynamics
will provide organisms to examine for poorly understood or novel
enzymatic pathways.  In collaboration with the Assessment element,
Community Dynamics will provide the basic data that need to be
monitored and assessed for soil community bioremedial activity of the
consortia as a whole <i> in situ </i> and <i>ex situ </i> and for the
maintenance of the community in relation to structure and function of the
consortia.  Finally, for the System Integration, Prediction, and
Optimization element, Community Dynamics will provide information
on bioremedially active members of the community to design and
calibrate the models.  <p>
Community Dynamics and Microbial Ecology will use molecular and
macro approaches to identify the individual species of the community
and detect variations within the species and differences in species
composition at different sites. It will characterize the consortia which
may, through molecular evolution, become a robust community that
utilizes and/or detoxifies mixed contaminants.  It will also explore
interrelationships between organisms in the community, evaluate the
community as a whole system in remediating the individual components
of the mixed contaminants in the presence of geologic and hydrogeologic
factors, and correlate the presence of metabolic genes with effective
bioremedial processes.  By understanding the complex multi-organismal
relationships of each of the populations involved and their interactions, the overall
goal to improve bioremedial activity in the field research center should be achieved. 
Community Dynamics and Microbial Ecology will focus on four subelements to
meet the overall goals described above.  These subelements are:<p>
