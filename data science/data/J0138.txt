            the corners are sure to make this a great high speed rollercoaster
            of a track. My son and I walked the North Course together and
            it reminded me a lot of Mid-Ohio. The view looking down the esses
            toward the pits is a real sphincter tightener. The serpentine
            curves leading back to the bridge should also be a real romp.
            Can't wait to take them at speed, especially if Phil is breathing
            fire in front of me.<BR>

          <TD WIDTH="78%">I was very impressed by two things this weekend.
            First was the smoothness of the new surface. You'd expect to
            have a brand new surface to be smooth, but there were no seams
            even left to right on the track where the two &quot;lanes&quot;
            met. The second thing that impressed me, was the transition lines
            both onto and off of the North / South cut through. The connecting
            pavement themselves are wonderful pieces of racetrack and not
            just pieces of track to get you from point A to point B. WELL
            DONE to the prep / paving crew and to those who designed the
            cut throughs.</TD>

            I was very favorably impressed with the attention to detail and
            to the focus on excitement (the wonderfully challenging track)
            and safety (lots of runoff and no armco or concrete walls). Mike
            Rand, the track manager, seems to be eager to accommodate the
            various driver schools and I did not get the impression that
            we would be second class citizens to the many race venues. The
            actual track layout is like a virtual reality, in your dreams
            track, and it is actual reality. You just cannot imagine the
            scale and complexity without being there. If the rest of the
            facility matches the track it will be awesome.</TD>

          <TD WIDTH="78%">VIR is a VA boy's dream come true. Having heard
            of this place for years and never having seen it, it is overwhelming
            to think we have one of the finest facilities in the country
            right here. My only concern is the layout of the North Circuit
            for school use. The distance from the entrance onto the crossover
            road to the pit straight without a passing area may develop some
            seriously long trains, with folks having to brake on the downhill
            esses enough to unsettle cars. Patience will be as important
            as at Roebling.</TD>

          <TD WIDTH="78%">I had seen the presentation of the proposed track
            about 18 months ago at Korman's in Greensboro, checked-out the
            website and seen track maps, but all of that was poor preparation
            for what I saw Sunday. I was truly impressed with not just the
            track layout, paving quality and the challenges awaiting us drivers.
            No, what got me was the details, the elements that make a good
            track a great track. Every corner, from the slow tight ones to
            the wide sweeping turn after the incredibly long straight, each
            one had a well thought-out and planned run-off area (except for
            one, which I'll get to). After several schools, off-road excursions
            and accidents (as a witness and participant, both) at several
            local area tracks, I'm really starting to appreciate the thought
            that goes into track preparation and particularly track run-offs.
            The beginning of the pit buildings for both the North and<BR>
            South tracks had ample plumbing in place for what I assume will
            be 20th century bathroom facilities (not to be confused with
            Port-a-Johns), the hot pits for the North course will actually
            be covered (!!) to keep us out of the hot sun, and everything
            really seemed to be done first class. Personally I can't wait
            to get out there! Only one turn, a turn from the straight onto
            the connector to complete the South course has a steep drop-off
            that in it's current state is sure to cause numerous rolls; this
            turn will have some type of barrier installed. Hopefully a gravel
            trap will also be installed to prevent any shattered fiberglass
            or crumpled metal. Other than that, the connector sections may
            actually provide more excitement than the original track. Be
            it the full track, South course or North course, this will be
            a fun place to drive!</TD>

            <P>VIR is going to happen in a big way!! A number of local trackheads
            trekked out to Milton on Nov 21 in response to rumors that VIR
            has now been paved. It has, and we were all amazed at the difference
            the paving makes. Although we were only being driven 'round the
            track in minivans it appears that the paving is first-rate with
            no discernible joints obvious. Folks, this is likely to be THE
            track on the east coast, or should I say tracks, since VIR is
            really 2 separate tracks. The 2.2 mile North Course contains,
            'lots' of elevation changes and some downhill esses that look
            'challenging'. I glad to see that tons of earth has been moved
            to ensure plenty of save runoff areas. The 1.6 mile South Course
            contains the famous 'Oak Tree' turn that has also received major
            attention to ensure <BR>
            more save runoff area. This leads to a long straight connected
            to a blind turn into descending on- and off-camber downhill esses.
            The connections between the short courses and the full track
            also appear to be very smooth.</P>

            <P>Both the North and the South courses have a flowing feel to
            them and are likely to keep us busy for quite a while trying
            to discover their respective secrets. I witnessed one of the
            first 'lines' being developed riding around the track in a minivan
            driven by Peter Krause (the tires only squealed one or twice....).
            Rumor has it the current minivan lap record is just under 3 minutes
            for the full track!</P>

            <P>The paddock area has been designed for some 600 cars, and
            for those July and August track dates there is a covered false
            grid area. Race and Regular fuel will be available by credit
            card purchase from self-serve pumps.</P>

            <P>Also heard at the track that Bertil Roos and Skip Barber driving
            schools will be very active at VIR, and that there will be a
            fleet of <A HREF="http://www.rmsci.com/picarchive/eprod6.jpg">Caterham
            Super 7s in SCCA race trim</A> available for rent. The first
            event is scheduled for March 2000, and something like 30 weekends
            have already been booked by various clubs.</P>

            <P>Eventually the track area, comprising some 1200 acres, will
            contain various other amenities such as a club house, tennis,
            swimming pool, <BR>
            go-carts, and more. However, I'm glad to see though that correct
<BR>
            priorities have been established. Bring on the track! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A

            <P>As someone who has had their hopes alternately raised, then
            dashed by the numerous rumours of VIR's reopening, I can't tell
            you how extraordinary it was to see the changes wrought by the
            venture headed by Harvey Siegel, Connie Nyholm and Mike Rand.</P>

            <P>I first saw VIR in August of 1998 when trees were growing
            through the pavement and electrified fences kept the cows from
            taking &quot;laps&quot; themselves...When Dick Lee, Harvey, Mike
            and I walked the cut-throughs for the North and South Courses,
            no one could have told me that they would flow as well as they
            do. The biggest single difference the weekend of November 20-21
            taught me was how it is impossible to convey how incredible this
            course is by looking at a flat pice of paper or pictures on a
            screen...</P>

            <P>When we take part in Driver's Ed events, we all too often
            get caught up in how many passing zones there are, or how we
            can get in a group without &quot;trains&quot;... What Driver's
            Ed is all about is improving your own skills, and this track,
            in all three configurations, will present a challenge for decades
            to come. The South Course presents the greatest challenge and
            perhaps the greatest reward for getting it right. The North Course
            is just plain <I>FAST!</I> <B>But don't read these words, get
            a helmet, get your car teched and GO to VIR!</B>
