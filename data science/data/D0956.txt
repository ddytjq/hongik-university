<h3> Early Years </h3>
Alfred Russell was born in 1920 in Chicago, Illinois.  He graduated and received his  
MFA at the University of  Michigan, then prepared for a doctorate in Art History at 
Columbia University.  He taught Art at Brooklyn College  from  1946 to 1976. Russell  
gained early recognition  in the initial part of the Abstract Expressionism movement,  
exhibiting both in New York and Paris alongside Wilhelm De Kooning,  Ad Reinhardt,  
Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Stanley William Hayter.  He studied with  Hayter 
at his renowned Atelier 17 in Paris, learning printmaking and  engraving  from this 
remarkable teacher of Picasso's.  In 1948 Alfred Russell met and married Andree 
Descharnes, Beaux Art trained painter, who with her brother the photographer and 
filmmaker Robert Descharnes was a member of the Paris Avant -garde art scene.  
Russell was already well known both in Paris and in New York by this time, exhibiting 
with Georges Mathieu and Camille Bryen in the legendary "Blanc et Noir" show at the 
galerie des Deux Iles and also at the Salon des Realites Nouvelles and in 1949 at the 
Galerie Pierre.  In New York Russell was exhibiting at Peridot Gallery 
and until 1953  was 
regularly included in The Whitney Annual with the museum purchasing a painting for 
their permanent collection in 1950. That same year he  was also included in the New 
Talent show at Koontz Gallery curated  by Meyer Shapiro and Clement Greenberg and 
he  was in  MOMA'S "Calligraphic and Geometric." In 1951, after an appearance in 
MOMA'S "Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America",  Russell spent the year in 
Paris where he was a huge success with his exhibit at the Galerie Colette Allendy as 
well as in the controversial "Vehemences Confrontees" with De Kooning and Pollock;  
a show organized by Michel Tapies,(who included Russell in his book, L'Art Autre).  In 
1952 Leo Castelli had Russell as a star player in his Bi-coastal exhibit; "American 
Vanguard" at New York's Sydney Janis gallery and at the Galerie de France in Paris.  
At this time Russell was preparing for his doctorate in  Art History with Margarethe 
Bieber,  the eminent classical scholar and authority on Hellenistic Sculpture.  

<h3>Disenchantment and Disenfranchisement </h3>
Increasingly  disenchanted with Abstraction, with the "New York Art Scene":  with  
"The Club" and it's  Cedar Tavern gatherings, Russell turned to the Figure and to the 
classical world. He found in   the Tragic Grandeur and eloquence of  Hellenistic 
Greece an answer,  much as Picasso had when he turned to the simplicity of 5th 
century classicism after World War 1.  In November of 1953 Alfred Russell, at a 
symposium on the human figure,  denounced Abstraction and The Art World, 
especially what he called the "bureaucratization of the avant garde." Although he did 
appear in the 1955 exhibit "New Decade" at the Whitney, Russell was now a  "persona 
non grata" and found himself effectively  "blacklisted."  Unable to exhibit, finding his 
name deleted from texts and omitted from new studies on postwar art, the artist all but 
disappeared in this  "Stalinist" re-writing of Art History. It is, however; in this 
obscurity, that the new figurative movement  took hold,  as Alfred Russell  created a 
new visual language using his discoveries in non-Euclidean geometry, perspective, 
human anatomy and dramatic expression. Living in Paris in 1955-56, he immersed 
himself in the paintings of the Louvre, quickly copying works by Poussin and 
Caravaggio among others. He met and befriended Albert Camus while working on  
Caravaggio's " Fortune Teller."  Russell also copied "Et In Arcadia," a darkly poetic 
philosophical painting by Nicolas Poussin,  the 17th century French artist who's 
interpretation of the classical world has inspired artists for centuries.   That year while 
staying at surrealist painter Kurt Seligmann's "Villa Seurat", Alfred Russell and his 
spouse Andree Descharnes had their only child, Elsie. 

<h3> Brooklyn College and the New Classicism</h3>
Returning to New York,  
Russell resumed his teaching of the MFA  program at Brooklyn College,  where his 
rigorous curriculum was attracting young artists from all over the world. Beginning 
with the generation of  Gabriel Laderman, himself a catalyst for the Realist movement 
in the 60's and 70's, Alfred Russell's students have become the core of a new force in 
figurative painting in America. Russell's daughter, Elsie, who also travels this road is 
curating this museum in answer to overwhelming demand of friends, students and 
scholars.  In 1975  Alfred Russell retired from Brooklyn College and the family moved 
to Europe to care for his spouse, Andree, who was dying of cancer and wished to be 
with her relatives in Nevers,  France. Andree died in March of 1976.  Russell settled 
briefly in Italy where he  reunited with long-time family friend Joan Silverstein, the 
author and classical scholar. They soon married, working and traveling throughout 
Europe. Russell is quite prolific and continues painting in a variety of styles, treating 
Abstraction, Geometric Topology, improvisational Calligraphy and figurative 
compositions merely as different expressive modes for his pre-Socratic understanding 
of a universe both unfathomable and in constant flux.  He is quoted in Serge Guilbaut's 
"How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art" with one of his characteristic flames, 
published in Iconograph: <strong>"I believe in power, activity, reflection, destruction and 
creation in art. I believe in confusion and above all, unevenness, in those who never 
find themselves. A painter is lost once he has found himself. Quantity is much more 
important than quality. Paint large pictures, crowded pictures. Scribbles, scrawls 
errantly reflect only terrifiedly about a past that is nightmarish. Eroticism in all forms 
is the pervading magnetism of the picture, the sun must bicker with an incessant 
madness."</strong>    After years of painting complex constellations of twisted, falling figures,  
Alfred Russell has been busy of late with new works of abstract calligraphy; which he 
is exhibiting in Paris, where he now lives.
