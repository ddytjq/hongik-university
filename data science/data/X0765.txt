<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p><b>Mark Mahan</b>, an Alaskan varsity basketball coach, offers his Player Handbook for the readers of the 
Coach's Notebook. A handbook is an essential tool for communicating team rules and policies to 
players and parents. And, if problems arise during the season that require disciplinary action, 
a handbook that documents the team policies can literally save a coach's job. Rules make it 
possible to administrate a team fairly. Take advantage of this handbook by pasting the information 
into your word editor and substituting the verbiage that best suits your team.</p>

<p><B>Practice Rules</p></B>
<p>Attending practice is a crucial part of a team's success and development.  Players and parents should be ready to make the four month commitment before the competitive season begins.
<ol>
<li>All practices are mandatory.  One un-excused absence and your participation and/or travel privileges will be in jeopardy. Whether an absence is excused or un-excused will be left to the coach's discretion. If a player absolutely must miss practice she should discuss the matter with her coach ahead of time whenever possible. If a player should miss practice due to illness, injury, or family matter, she should bring a note signed by her parents explaining the situation to her coach as soon as possible.  This does not excuse the absence, but will assist the coach in making a determination.  Please remember that you must be present in every class all day to be eligible to practice.  You must still come and watch even if you can't practice. One unexcused absence and a player will not participate in one quarter of the next game. Additional un-excused absences will put a player's participation and /or traveling privileges in jeopardy.</li>
<li>Punctuality.  Players should be dressed, stretched, and ready to run at 3:45 pm on early practice days and at 6:00 pm on late practice days. Times may vary as is necessary to accommodate gym scheduling etc.  Players will be notified of any changes at the beginning of each practice week.  The coaching staff will make every effort possible to minimize these changes, but occasionally they are inevitable.  Players must make the effort to ensure they are aware of the weekly schedule. Players not present and prepared at the designated practice times will be required to run one suicide for every minute she is late.  More than one occasion of showing up late will result in an unexcused absence.</li>
<li>Be respectful of your teammates and coaches.  No name calling, harsh criticism, foul language, or rude comments will be tolerated.  If this rule is unclear to a player she should discuss her questions with her coach.  Talking while the coach is instructing is disrespectful and will not be tolerated. Continual violations of the rule will result in dismissal from practice.  If a player is asked to leave practice she will be counted absent thus jeopardizing participation and travel privileges.</li>
<li>Come prepared and ready to practice.  Your coaches will show up everyday with a practice preparation and ready to teach, and we expect our players to come and give us 100%.  There will be a lot of new things to go over especially at the start of the season, and the only way we as a team will benefit is to have committed, hardworking individuals showing up, willing and ready to participate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following are some examples of un-excused absences I've heard.</p>

<ol>
<li>I forgot my shoes.</li>
<li>I had to go shopping in Soldotna.</li>
<li>I went skiing at Alyeska.</li>
<li>I went to see a rock concert in Anchorage.</li>
<li>I had band practice.</li>
<li>I had to do my homework.</li>
<li>I didn't feel well (let your coach know before leaving school).</li>
<li>My ankle hurt.</li>
<li>My (friend, boyfriend, sister, brother, mom, dad) needed a ride home.</li>
<li>I didn't know we had practice.</li>
<li>My family went on vacation.</li>
<li>I had a dentist appointment.</li>
<li>I had to baby-sit.</li>
</ol>

<p><B>Eligibility Requirements</p></B>

<p>Academic eligibility is checked every three weeks on Fridays. If a student has an F, she is ineligible to compete from the Monday after the grade check until the following Monday.  If the student raises her grade during that week, she is still ineligible for the entire week, but will be permitted to compete in the following two weeks until the next grade check.  There are no exceptions to this rule.
<p>If a student's name appears on the ineligible list, she is still expected to participate in practice.
<p>Players will be required to submit a grade check on the first week of practice or tryouts.  Grades may be used in determining status during tryouts. If a student shows a grade of less than a C, she will be required to meet with her teacher and determine a plan to bring that grade up as soon as possible.  She can also be required to attend daily study hall during lunch in the computer lab until the grade is up to the required minimum of C.
<p>The Academic Award at the state tournament is the most coveted award in the state. It is awarded each year to the team participating in the state tournament with the highest accumulative grade point average.  To bring this award to the Homer High remains the Mariners number one goal of the season.

<p><B>Travel Policy</p></B>

<p>We have thirteen road games this season.  The following rules have been instated this year (in addition to the traveling guidelines set by the borough) to ensure safety and team order.
<ol>
<li>Team travel is a privilege, not a right.  Player must be academically and athletically eligible.  Grades, behavior, and the coaching staff will determine whether a player travels with the team.
<li>Attendance at practice is mandatory.  Un-excused absences will jeopardize travel privileges.</li>
<li>Attendance in school and on time, as well as practice the day of travel is mandatory.  Saturday travel requires attendance on Friday. No exceptions.</li>
<li>Traveling with the team is required, unless otherwise arranged with the coach prior to departure from Homer.  Return travel with a parent requires a written note requesting the coach's permission to travel with anyone other than the team as well as a personal request from the player's parent.  The coach reserves the right to keep the team together for travel during the  duration of a road trip.</li>
<li>If at any time while traveling to or from a game a player fails to use common sense and chooses to act in a way that is illegal or irresponsible to herself, her coach, her school, or her team, her traveling and participation privileges will be in jeopardy.</li>
<li>Pre-arrange procedure.  Students must obtain a form at least 2 days in advance of days missed that week. Students will bring the form to every class she will miss to obtain assignments missed. Students will turn the form into the office the day before the travel date.</li>
</ol>

<p><B>Drug/Alcohol Policy</p></B>

<p>Any participation in illegal activity during the season will result in automatic dismissal from the basketball program.  A player is not permitted to drink alcohol or use illegal drugs or be in the presense of anyone using illegal substances during the season. You are expected to live and act as responsible role models for the students of Homer High.  If a player finds herself in a situation where she is not sure of what actions to take she should make the following considerations:
<ol>
<li>I will get caught. Trust me the coach always finds out.</li>
<li>Is it worth the trouble I will cause myself and my family?</li>
<li>Is it worth giving up basketball for?</li>
<li>Is it worth letting down my teammates for?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any player not able to make this commitment for the duration of the season should pursue other interests.  Attached is a personal contract to be signed by both the player and her parent and should be turned in to her coach no later than the first day of practice.

<p><b>Team Selection and Cut Policy</p></b>

<p>We will be conducting three days of skill testing during tryouts.  This will be drills conducted to test conditioning, speed, quickness, the level of development of various basketball skills such as dribbling, offensive and defensive footwork, and basic knowledge of the game.  We will make every effort to meet with each player and identify what her role may or may not be in the program. Due to the large number of players expected in the program, I anticipate a number of players that will warrant a cut.  

<p>It will be a policy, seniors may only go out for varsity, there may be seniors that will have a limited role on the team.  No juniors will play c-team, but may be on JV with limited playing time.  Only first year sophomores may play c-team, however there may be  instances due to shortage of players that second year sophomores may need to fill in for limited  c-team roles. All players will be placed at the level most appropriate for them, taking into account work ethic, maturity, and skill level.   Within these guidelines, it is our policy to play each player at the level at which they will get the most playing time.  This is a competitive program.  The players who the coaching staff think can get the job done will receive varsity playing time.  The JV program is competitive as well, and players will not be guaranteed time although coaches will make every effort to do so.  C-team is competitive but with an emphasis on skill development.  All players will get to play, but not necessarily in every game or equal playing time.  

<p><b>Lettering Policy</p></b>

<p>All seniors with the team will letter.
<p>All varsity players who plays in at least one fourth of the varsity games on the schedule will letter.
<p>Any player, whom the coaching staff feels has had a significant impact on the team.

<p><b>Miscellaneous</p></b>

<p>All physicals must be turned in prior to participating in the first practice. The high school activity fee of  $100 must be paid within 7 days of the first practice. No athlete will be allowed to practice unless the fee is paid. All consent forms must be signed and in athletic directors office prior to first practice.
<p>Uniforms will be issued prior to the first game.  Players are responsible for keeping them clean and cared for.  The player will pay for lost or damaged uniforms.
<p>Team and individual pictures will be taken on 12/10/01(?).  Anyone interested in purchasing a picture package should complete the order form and return it with check enclosed to xxxx
<p>Academics come first. Let a coach know if you are having trouble so we can get you help. Do not wait till eligibility checks. 
<p>Water bottles at practice are mandatory. No cell phones at practice.
<p>If you have an injury, notify a coach immediately.
<p>Nutrition and plenty of fluids is essential during the season.  Maintaining a healthy diet of three square meals a day, including fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and drinking adequate amounts of water will help in maintaining muscle tissue elasticity and flexibility that may be stressed or damaged during strenuous exercise.  I strongly urge you to use some sort of vitamin supplements during the season to help in your nutrition.  Refrain from drinking coffee, tea, sodas or eating junk foods.

<p><b>Parent Information</p></b>
<p>We have one tournament and one overnight road trip to Palmer this year.  It has been my experience that players perform best when staying in a hotel room rather than on a classroom floor.  I believe it is easier for to get the necessary rest and study time under more comfortable conditions of the hotel room. With our current low budget, be prepared for the cost incurred on the road trips.  Seldom does this expense exceed $20 per night per player plus meal money.  I will advise the players at the beginning of each week of travel as to the cost of our stay.  Anyone interested in helping to raise travel funds for the program should contact our booster club representative .
<p>I would appreciate no parents in the gym during tryouts or during the first two weeks of practice.  There will be enough pressure on the kids and coaches during this time with new staff and a lot of new material to cover, without the added pressure of parent involvement.
<p>Please refrain from criticism of officials, players, or coaches while attending games.  Try to be positive and supportive of your team.
<p>I am open to discuss any concerns you might have with your daughter regarding academics, health, or other concerns for her well being.  If there is any matter that may be affecting her performance that we should know about please let us know.
<p>I am not open to discussing playing time or my choice of coaching strategy.
<p>Practices over the holidays are mandatory.  If players miss practices they are missing valuable instruction time. Remember that the coaches are taking time away from their vacation time also.  We will have a practice schedule, which will be brief and compacted and allowing for plenty of family time. We will try to have it scheduled before the start of the season to allow adequate planning time.
<p>Please contact me if you have any questions:<br>

<p>I have also opened a web site with information concerning games, practice times, and various topics that may be of use. A copy of this handbook will be there online.  There is a message board if you have questions for the coaches. I will make every effort to keep this updated throughout the season.  Any interested parents willing to volunteer to help update the web site please contact me.
