<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Dear Lord! First of all i think your one of da best, when it come to answering 
basketball questions. Anyways i got a huge problems your highness.  In a field of battle 
i get nervous i can't concentrated rite. I guess is juss becuz i'm at war with new strangers 
and spectators i juss don't played to my fully ability.  Particularly when i messed up like 
take a bad shot or bad pass, than my low self-esteem rises. And lack on defences and 
my whole life seem to fall apart. So i'm askin' for your royalty help. If it help i been 
fightin' in war for 4yrs now , but i'm still a young soldier (16yrs old). I'm wierd huh? 
thanks, i hope this letter reach u in time befored my next battle........ </p>

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>I must say I enjoyed your entry in the Coach's Notebook immensely. You have a 
great sense of humor. You must have read the section &quot;Basketball is 
like War&quot;. Anyway, I'll tell you a secret. Everybody feels insecure, 
especially at your age. Being in sports puts you in front of crowd where your 
all exposed so naturally you feel self-conscious. But, what is true for you 
is also true for your &quot;enemy&quot;. Even the kid on the other team that acts 
all cocky isn't really all that secure, he's just trying to cover it up in 
his own way. The good thing about sports is that it helps you learn to 
perform in front of people. You also learn that people to talk loud or show 
off really aren't very powerful.</p>

<p>I understand that when you blow a 
shot, you feel your &quot;low self esteem rising&quot; (I loved that one). But it works 
the other way, too. When you knock down a great shot, don't you feel good? I 
think the key is to want that feeling of success so badly you don't worry 
about the embarrasing moments. Instead you just look forward to the next 
opportunity to do something good.</p>

<p>So, the next time you mess up, don't 
worry about it. You're going to mess up again anyway - everybody does. But 
you're also going to do great things again. Get excited about that instead of 
upset about mistakes. All you gotta do is be more positive in your outlook. 
Basketball is a game ... it oughta be fun, right?</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>hey i play basketball almost everyday. and i play on my high school team. i'm 5'8 or 5' 9 at most. and 
i can almost dunk our nets and they are higher than most highschools. I would appreciate it if 
u could help me improve my verticle jump with a prgramme or words of wisdom. i weight train too 
and i weigh 195 lbs. i can bench 315 so if u recomend a work out i know the exercices though i 
already know what one to do. I would just like ur opinion . thanx darren zettler</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Normally I do not answer questions about dunking. Too many kids think its the definition of a 
good basketball player and the fact is that many, many very good basketball players never dunk all 
season. It a tool for showing off, not much more. However, your question intrigued me because you are 
a weight lifter. I know some body builders who do not play basketball and they can jump off two 
feet and dunk the ball with both hands. The key is the suberb development of their calf muscles, 
thighs and glutes. They get this development with leg presses and toe raises with weights. Talk with 
your weight teacher/advisor about lower body development and try it out. You may likely need to 
practice jumping as well. See how many times you can touch the bottom of the backboard in 15 seconds. 
Test yourself four times a day. You will get better at it.

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hey-
I am actually a basketball player but i thought you would be able to help me out. i am in junior 
high, and the coach at our high school is only letting the junior high's that feed into the high 
school run a motion offense. it is not working very well for the team, and i am becoming quite 
frustrated with the situation. our point guard has practically given up and won't hardly even 
call the offense anymore. i play the two and three guard position. i am wondering if you could 
provide me with any information on how to make this offense more affective for my team. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Actually, the motion is my favorite offense. Its very hard to defend because the offense can make 
subtle (or drastic) changes based on what the defense does and therefore the offense is very 
unpredictable. To understand the motion offense, the players must first work very hard on the two and 
three man game. By that I mean be experts on pick and roll, give and go, passing into the post 
and cutting, setting screens for players away from the ball. These are easy to practice. Just break 
the team down and play 2 on 2 and 3 on 3 and just do one type of play (like pick and roll) and try 
to perfect every detail of it. In the actual 5 man game, the motion offense is really just 2 or 3 
players executing these basic plays. </p>
<p>Another thing that makes the motion offense different is that it is based on rules, not a pattern. 
Our team follows these rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you pass to a post, cut to the basket</li>
  <li>If you pass point to wing, the point picks for the other wing</li>
  <li>If there is no pass to the post, the post can either screen away for the other post so he can break 
toward the ball or the post can set up a pick and roll for the wing with the ball.</li>
  <li>If the ball is passed to the point, everybody resets.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all there is to it. With rules, everyone on our team knows what to expect. We will succeed 
if we pass to the post effectively and then MOVE. Players who pass and stand are death to the 
motion offense.</p>
<p>Your coach has chosen a good offense. You guys need to learn these things if you want to progress 
in basketball, so pay your dues now and learn it. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi Coach!
<p>My team of girls born 86 are soon faceing one of our biggest opponents ín championship games, both we and they got the same team since last year. Eccept for one new big center that they have accuired from a another town. This makes their advantage in height so much bigger, we only got one girl over 6 feet and they now got two. And my player has a bad habit in trying to block every shoot that is even near her, this of cause puts her in foul troubble in some games.
<p> My team is betther on the 1,2,3 and 4 position but now that they have two big centers we are probably gonna get our ass kicked under the baskets. Our big player is more mobile (or is agile the right word?) so fronting on their big girl and hope that she can't catch the loob pass, might be a good thing to do. Or do you got any other hits or tactic for us that you might find suitable?
<p>Sorry for my bad english.
<p>Anton Nilsson - Sweden</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter. My ancestors are Swedish, so we have more 
in common than basketball. I understood your English very well. </p>
<p>I agree that fronting the post is the best idea. But, if you front the post, you 
must also put great pressure on the passer. The lob pass requires finesse. If 
you pressure the passer, the pass is much more difficult. Do NOT block 
shots. Especially if you have just one tall player at center. You cannot 
afford to have her get fouls. The percentages are much more in your favor if 
you simply keep your arms up and then box out to get rebounds. Blocking shots 
will not help you. If the shot is blocked, the ball just goes out of bounds 
and then they get to run a baseline play. It is bad strategy to block 
shots. 
<p>Well, good luck. Please write back and tell me how your team did. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I starting to coach a 14-15 year old team and all my guards love going to their strong side 
all the time how do I get them better with there weak hand?</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Do you teach your players to over-play the strong hand when they are on defense? If we notice 
that a player can only dribble with one hand, we guard his strong side 100% and force him togo with 
weak hand. If your players are doing that in practice, they'll help each other learn the value of using 
either hand to dribble. You'll also need to do drills where only the weak hand is used and make sure 
the kid understand that they cannot advance if they are one-handed players.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>5th Grade Girls Basketball.  My team has a fairly good ball handling point guard but we have real problems making the first offfense pass to one of two breaking out wings.  How do you teach this concept or is it just a matter of developing timing between the girls?</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Thanks for your letter to the Coach's Notebook. The entry pass is a crucial element to practice. 
We spend a lot of time with it and our team is 9th grade boys. Timing is important, but there is 
much more that can be taught.</p>
<p>First, the receivers need to work hard. We teach a dive to the baseline 
then all the way back to the wing spot at full speed to get open. Another option 
is to go to the baseline then curl around the post and come back up. Many wings 
think they will get free with a shrug and a step. Its not that easy. I tell my 
kids they need to take at least three steps and then change direction to get 
open. Otherwise the defense can just stand there and guard them.</p>
<p>Passes need to be crisp. They should be made at the moment the receiver 
changes direction. The passes should be fairly short, say about 12 feet. If the 
players get too close, there will be too many defenders in the way. Too far and 
the passes are easier to pick off. Passers should use fakes to keep the defense 
off balance. If the defender guarding the wing comes out past the three point 
line, its an automatic signal to back door.</p>
<p>Those are the essentials. I suggest devoting part of practice to just 
making that pass. You can also practice in a 2:2 mode to get more involved at 
once.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I took your advice and asked for a meeting with the schools athletic director. And when I went to pick my son up from practice it was a closed practice and he told the kids in the locker room that their parents could complaine that he was not there to get them ready to play high school ball its about having a winning team and he doesn't think the other 10 are what it takes. he then pointed out to all the kids which parents have a problem with the way he coaches which embarrased the kids. He tried to intimidate these kids with telling them that the middle school principal supports him and he can act any way he wants, He also keeps going back to playing time when the parents that have a problem keep saying it is not playing time its a bout breaking these kids self esteem. We accept that this goes on in high school but middle school these kids are trying to fit in.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>my son made his middle school basketball team. let me start by saying we are not complaining about playing time just opportunity, and I want to explaine my child is small and the coach told him he has more skill than the big kids but he will never give him the opportunity because he isn't interested in little kids. this is  apparent because the four smallest don't play and when they do and the team losses its their fault and he tells them in front of the starters. mind that they play all of 10 minutes. he also takes the five starters out to dinner after each game and never invites the other 7 players which make these kids feel bad. And he has 2 hour practices where these kids sit and watch the starters practice. He also asked them to quit the team because he only did them a favor by letting them on the team . bear in mind some 89 kids tried out.And he doesn't know my kid.He also lets two dads make plays and run the program. this is middle school basketball. these two dads go in the locker room to intimidate these kids before and after games and he encourages it. He has managed to destry my sons self
esteam. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Im coaching rec for 8 year olds.  I wanted to start with teaching positions.  
I'm pretty old and we used to play with 2 guards, 2 forwards and a center.  
My understandfing is today the positions are numbered 1 thru 5.  
pls explain this to me.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Basketball hasn't changed so much. All the good things you know will still work. When folks 
talk numbers, they simply mean that a 1 is the point guard, 2 is the shooting guard, 3 is the small 
forward who often has a similar role to the 2, 4 is the power forward who almost always plays a 
post position, and 5 is the traditional center.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>2-1-2 Zone  what do you do against it, besides shoot from outside? Thanks, MT</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>The reason your opponent is playing the 2-1-2 is to give up the outside shot
  and prevent you from&nbsp;penetrating. The 2-1-2 is a good choice for this as
  it has a well balanced formation that close its gaps from attacks in any
  direction. So, the best plan of attack is to overload it heavily to get open
  shots. When we face a team that plays zone, one thing I like to do is
  accelerate the game pace as much as possible. Transition and advancing the
  ball after a made basket are specific team skills we practice. While one
  player is pulling the ball out of the net, two players are breaking to the
  sidelines and another to mid-court, and the last guy is going all the way. If
  they do it right, the ball progresses to the other end of the court with about
  3 seconds. That kind of pressure often catches the zone unready and allows you
  open opportunities. Another idea is to go to a four corners offense once you
  have the lead. Unless you have a shot clock, the other team will be forced to
  come away from the basket and try and get the ball. Its not an exciting brand
  of basketball, but very effective.

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm just one of those parents thrown into helping out the team because there is no one to do it.  I have agreed to keep track of stats.  Can you help me with a simple form....these are 11 year old girls.  We thought we might just keep track of baskets made, rebounds???  Do you have any suggestions?
Thanks.  First game  is this Saturday!
Lynne</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Try this basic form in the <a href="downloads.html">downloadable tools section
o</a>f this site. 
You just put hash marks next to the player's name in the appropriate column. The court diagram 
allows you to mark where shots were taken and made if you want to do that. The chart is a pdf 
document. If you can't open it, go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a> and
download their free reader. Its easy. There is also a more detailed stat program (MS Excel-based) 
in the Downloadable Tools section.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I am trying to work with a 9th grade girl who is a guard. <br>
   She has a nice shot and is an ok dribbler.  However,the problem area seems to be the following:<br>
   1. speed.  <br>
   2. Poor reaction time.<br>
   I have tried to work with her by having her run and help her recognize her lack of speed.  <br>
   I am stuck.  I just don't have or know of drills to help her improve in these ares.  <br>
   Can you help?</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Speed is one of those athletic qualities that you can enhance, but only with a lot of work, and 
then not much. The player won't be fast, just a little better. Drills that may help include feet fire 
(rapid steps in place), quick slide steps across the key and back (fast as possible) and bounds (explosive 
steps off one foot). The bright side is that I have seen some relatively slow kids do well because 
they learn to compensate through anticipation. They have seen different basketball scenarios play out 
enough times that they can guess what will happen next and be correct most of the time. Trusting 
that information they take action sooner than the other kids and gain an edge. Your player may 
need to visualize the immediate future to improve her apparent speed and reaction times.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Good day, My question pertains to the Press Breaker - 2 on the Baseline.  Am I right in assuming 
that this play can only be run after a basket by the opponent has been made?  Have you ever heard 
of the play/ball being called dead and a turnover created because the ref. was not sure of the 
ruling?  I have seen a ref. make a call under similar circumstances when a &quot;wing or 
point&quot; takes the rebound as it comes through the net, takes the ball out of bounds 
(maybe he was not out of bounds) and then throws the ball to the &quot;post&quot; as he comes out 
of bounds to set up for the throw back in. I got killed (final score 38-35 but we were ahead by 
20 at the half) last night because of a press in the second half.  I have 4 press breaker plays 
in place but, as you know all the things that could go wrong did.  It was as if they had never 
seen a press or played against it, and they never completed any of the plays.  
&quot;Deer in the headlight syndrome&quot;.  I look forward to hearing from you.<br>
Coach Paul Wahnish</p>

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Thanks for your question to the Coach's Notebook. You can run the &quot;Two on 
the Baseline&quot; play after two situations. One, after a made basket; two, after 
the ball is awarded to you after your team was called for goal tending. It is 
not legal to pass the ball out of bounds to another player on a spot throw-in. 
The ref should indicate the limits of travel to the inbounder. A spot throw-in 
gets 3', the other two cases the entire baseline.</p>
<p>I suggest picking one pressbreaker and mastering it and just having one 
other for a fall back. That may help your deers get back on the path.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello!
<p> My name is Jonatan Mossberg, I live in a city in Sweden called Södertälje pretty close to the 
capital Stockholm. Last spring I had my, compared to the school system i USA, high-school 
examination. One of my subjects in school was basketball, those students that were going in my 
class practised a sport, in my case basketball, three mornings a week and we also studied some 
theory in basketball. I got the highest grades in the second and third year but the first I didn´t. 
I´ve now decided trying to upgrade my grade from the first year. To do that I´ve got to write 
an essay about how you should play and practice to be a good point guard, both mentally, 
physicly and technically. I´ve got this task from the coach for Södertälje Kings 
(www.sodertaljekings.com), Waldo Teppans. He thinks that this is a great task for me to do 
(and so do I) because I play as point-guard by my self.</p>
<p> I would be very thanksfull if you could spare some time to write down your appointments 
to what you think characterize a good point-guard and what you can do to become a better 
point-guard. Otherwise maybe you can recommand a good web-site that handles the subject, 
or maybe a great book or video-tape or other person...</p>
<p> I´m sorry about my poor english but I hope you understand what I mean.</p>
<p>Jonatan Mossberg #7 Södertälje Knights (Youth team, winners of the 20-and-under-championship 
in Sweden 2000-2001)</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>This is a good question. It would take me 1000 words to really describe a good point guard, and 
maybe that would be a good idea for a future article. But, I think your coach is looking for you 
to do some searching within your own mind to define a good point guard. Great point guards are not 
all the same. Some look to score, some use sheer speed and quickness to create pass openings and
 some are very analytical and use the other players to create space.</p>
 <p>What I look for in a point guard is control. I want the point to set the pace for the game, 
 either slowing the game or accelerating it. The point needs to insist that the offense runs as 
 planned. That means not giving players the ball until they are where they are supposed to be. The 
 point is the primary ball handler. All the other players should trust him with the ball at every 
 opportunity. They know that the point will give the ball back to them at the right time for 
 scoring a basket. The point is a leader, often the team captain, because he is the floor general. 
 He looks at the game as five people working together to solve a common problem, not as a hero 
 trying to save his team.</p>
 <p>My favorite college point guard right now is Dan Dickau who plays for Gonzaga University. Watch 
 him if you can. I also like Bevin Knight, who played for Stanford but now is in the NBA. John 
 Stockton, of course, is great example.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>This question relates to basketball but also to working out in general, I am 14 years old and 
started high school this year... I did not try out for the team this year but I saw i couldve made 
it had i given it my all, but this isnt like elementary school I couldnt have really dominated 
the games, since there are people that can jump real high and people with good amount of strength</p>
<p>I wanted to start working out but I wanted to be fully verced on all the good and bad effects, 
I have herd about losing your growth and other stuff so I do not want to jump into weights just yet 
I want to wait for that, but my question is how long should I wait... and at this age (14) what 
kind of exercises or training should I be doing that will not caue my and negitive effects to any 
part of my body... Also if there is a good basketball workout for me that wouldnt have any harmful 
effects to my body can yea post it or gimme a link because I am interested... Thanks in advance 
- Sarwar Qureshi</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>First, I am sorry you didn't try out for your team. The joy of basketball is not in dominating. 
The joy is actually from working with other people to achieve goals that cannot be achieved alone. 
There are many good athletes in our school who do not try out because they either fear to fail 
or they only want to dominate, not compete. I hope you will try out next year because you will have 
fun even if you are not the best player on the court.</p>

<p>You can work with weights without fear of stopping your growth. The worst danger is in trying to 
lift too much. If you try for maximum weight, you can damage your muscles, tendons and growth plates. 
However, if you train with medium weights, your body will respond in positive ways. Find a local 
qualified coach or trainer that will help you and follow their advice. I am not going to recommend 
a workout because I have not met you in person. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Coach,
I coach 8th grade girls.  They are a great bunch of kids and work hard at practice, but the 
problem we are having is throwing the ball away in our 1/2 court offense.  The last game we 
had I told the girls to slow things down and just make the easy pass.  They became very 
mechanical in their game and still threw the ball away.  Any suggestions?
<p>Greg Loveland</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Passing is an underestimated skill. If you have weakness in your passing 
game, intense defense will certainly discover that fact. As you have learned, a 
more deliberate style will make them predictable. They need to maintain their 
game pace and feel free to be a little creative.</p>
<p>With my teams, poor passing has boiled down to these causes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The recipients stand and wait for the pass. Pass receivers need to work 
hard to get open, using teammates as screens and making sudden changes in 
direction to shake defenders. When the pass is on the way, the receiver should 
be moving toward it. Its hard work. Kids that won't work hard won't get the 
ball.</li>

  <li>Passers are too obvious. The need to understand misdirection (eyes and 
fakes) and manipulate the defense's eagerness to move them out of the passing 
lane.</li>

  <li>Passes are weak. Passes that have low velocity and/or are inaccurate are 
ripe for picking. Receivers can help by showing targets (their hands), but the 
passes need to be firm and accurate. </li>

  <li>Passes that are too long (the longer the more dangerous) are risky. 
Player spacing on the floor is critical. While the passes need to be short and 
crisp, if the players get too close, there are too many defensive players in the 
way. 10-15 feet is optimum.</li>

  <li>Cross court passes and passes from traps (especially from the corners) 
are easy to read. Avoid those. Passes should be made before the ballhandler is 
in trouble. Maybe the players are dribbling too much.</li>

  <li>Passers make high risk decisions and force the pass into people who are 
not open.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&nbsp;suspect one or more of these problems is affecting your team. Once you 
decide which problem is hurting you most, focus on it. Then move to the next. As 
you can see, these are corrected by education and a little effort. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I JUST STARTED TO COACH A GIRLS 12 -13 YEAR OLD LEAGUE I NEED 10 EASY PLAYS THEY PLAY GOOD DEFENSE BUT LACKING ON OFFENSE                                 THANKS SHELBY FIELDS</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>I suggest you just pick one or two offensive patterns that are easy to 
teach as well as an out of bounds play from the base line and from the 
sideline. That's all. Instead of knowing several plays, it's much more 
effective to perfect a few plays.</p>
<p>The plays I diagrammed in the article &quot;<a href="easyplays.html">Easy Offensive Sets&quot;</a> should work well. The article is 
found in my topic menu in the upper right hand corner of the site.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I was wondering if you had any set drills that you could give 11u boys team to practice  at home on their own? So they can practice at home in between practice dates.
Thanks, matt</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>No ... but that may be a good topic. I spent many, many hours with my sons practicing in the driveway. 
Those times were really enjoyable for me. We worked on shooting, mostly. I'd take the pass as the post, 
then feed him back as he cut for threes and layups. We also worked on drives to the basket with me as 
the dummy defense. Its important not to block shots or foul, rather set up different angles and let 
him practice them over and over. Don't over coach. Just be a practice tool and have fun.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF DEFENSIVE MEASURES</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Well, one primary disadvantage is if you are taking defensive measures, you do not have the 
basketball. In this game the ball is power. You can't score without the ball. So, I guess the 
best plan is to be on defense as little as possible. However, the team that is taking the best 
defensive measures will likely spend the least time on defense, so defensive measure are a good thing.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Let say your the coach of a basketball team what would you give your players in the following situations
<p>a) A time out has been called with 15 seconds left in the game. Your team is down by two points and the opposition is to bring the ball in form their defensive baseline.
<p>b) Your team of short, quick players is due to play a team of tall, lumbering players.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Well, I am the coach of a basketball team. And, I like hypothetical questions, so let see what happens.
<p><u>End Game Scenario</u>: This is a desperate situation where we must acquire the basketball or lose. There 
are two ways to do this: foul them (hopefully, they are in the bonus) or force a turnover through 
pressure defense. Most young teams shoot about 50% from the foul line, often less when the pressure is 
on. I would foul immediately and hope to get the ball back with as much time on the clock as possible. 
At 50%, the foul only costs me .75 in the one on one; and only 1 point in the double bonus. Of course, 
the fouled player may make both shots, but the odds are against it. Now, if the opponent had already 
demonstrated they will make most of their fouls shots, then we go m2m full court pressure with an 
emphasis on defending passing lanes. If we can stop the dribbler and force him to pass, we'll gamble 
everything on an interception. A turnover is great and there is the potential for a ten second call, 
too. We can score with 5 seconds to go with our sideline plays.</p>
<p><u>David vs Goliath</u>: A game is really a long series of decisions and executions. In this situation, I 
want most of those decisions and executions to take place where we have the advantage. So, the theme 
is to stage the defensive battle in the middle of the court instead of near the baskets. When we get 
the ball, we'll press our speed advantage to the maximum, hoping to get a quick clean shot before 
their defense is established. The tempo must be maintained as high as possible. You may suffer some 
turnovers due to the pace, but theoretically, they will suffer more than you. If the big team is 
successful breaking your press, then front passes to the post and concede long shots. Longer shots 
rebound further from the hoop, increasing your chances of getting the ball.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>When coaching a group of junior players, could you explain six basic principles you would 
emphasise to them when performing a set shot.</p>
<p>How about seven basic principles? If you only want six, strike one of these. Anyway, avoid 
these shooting pitfalls:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Twisted body. Align feet, hips, shoulders perpendicular to the basket. (Actually, 
I am changing my thinking on this one. In a set shot situation, like a free throw, angle 
can be beneficial. If a right handed shooter has his toes and body pointed slightly to 
the left, the arm mechanics and alignment are much smoother and the dominant eye has a 
better view of the basket. The more I experiment with these concepts, the more I like them.</li>
  <li>Inconsistent release. Watch the fingers as the player follows through. Do they turn away from basket at release? </li>
  <li>Non-vertical movement. Does the player leave the ground at an angle? Motion should be straight up or slightly toward the basket. </li>
  <li>Elbow flare. The elbow should remain close to the body. If it sticks out to the side, the shot will vary side-to-side and tend to be flat.</li>
  <li>No arc. The ball should travel well above the rim (15-17' at peak). Flat shots have a very small 
window to enter the basket. A nicely arced shots sees most of the basket circumference as it descends. Also, 
the ball is more likely to bounce up off the rim rather than back to the shooter.</li>
  <li>Ball on palm. The ball should be balanced on the fingertips during the shot, not resting on the 
palm where control is lost. There should be a discernable gap between the ball and the palm. This 
habit is a carryover from when the players are too small to hold the ball correctly. The 
thumb of the shooting hand should have a 45 degree angle up and toward the ball.</li>
  <li>Shot initiated from the hip or chest. Another carryover from days when so much strength was 
needed to merely reach the rim. Shots should generate from the triple threat position. The elbows 
should be at eye level when the shot is released. The higher the shot release, the harder it 
is to block.</li>
</ol>

      <h3>Question
    </h3>
      <p>I have coached the 6th grade team in our town for the past 5 years.  This year, another guy wants to take a second team, this is assuming we have enought to field to teams.  Anyway, we agreed to start with everyone practicing for two weeks, then split them up according to rank, hoping to field two teams of equal talent throughout.  
      <p>Any suggestions on how to rank them would be helpful, such as passing, dribbling, attitude, shooting etc...all the basic fundamentals I assume.
      <p>I'm looking for anything though as this is a first for me.  Thanks.

      <h3>Answer</h3>
      <p>If you want to keep your teams balanced, first evenly divide up the better guards. The kids that can 
  handle the ball will have the biggest impact on your game at that age. After that, balance the 
  height. If each team has some big guys and some little guys, you can teach a typical basketball style 
  that will help them in the long run. Another consideration is to keep family members together. The 
  parents will appreciate the logistical help. Also, if its feasible, keep players who are buddies 
  together. That will make the experience more fun for them. Here's an idea, too. Each coach can 
  privately make a list of the kids he'd most like to have on his team, as if he was just picking a 
  single team. Then compare the lists. Odds are the two lists will differ more than you think. Once 
  each coach gets the kids only he selected, you can negotiate for the remaining players that were 
  chosen by both coaches. I have seen this method work before at open tryouts and its pretty 
  surprising how differently coaches choose players.

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I'm a sophomore in high school and I'm trying to improve my form and change my basketball form 
and shoot from my right side because, I shoot form my left side. I just want to know will you 
please give me some tips on how I should improve my form and how I should hold the ball when I 
shoot. I'm trying to be the best I can and get a basketball scholarship. Please e-mail me.

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>I think you are very wise to become proficient at shooting with either hand. Remember how 
effective Larry Bird was? All he ever needed was a window to shoot the ball through using either 
hand and he could score. Another advantage is that as you learn to use the right hand, you'll find you 
need to think through your technique. That will make you more analytical which will make you better 
equipped to adjust when you need to.</p>
        <p>The trick is to start close. Stand two feet from the basket and shoot 50 shots concentrating on 
technique: bend your knees, extend your arms, flip your wrist and follow through. Back up 2 feet 
and do it again, and again until you are shooting free throws. Do this every day. When you play with 
friends, try to shoot all your shots right handed no matter how ugly it looks. </p>
        <p>In about two weeks, you'll notice a change. You will start shooting naturally with either hand, 
especially near the hoop. Whenever you have a positional advantage by using your body as shield, 
you be able to use the protected hand to shoot.</p>
        <p>The process is simple, but tedious. You need to be determined and consistent. It will be frustrating 
at first because it will take time to train yourself. Keep track of how many you make and miss each 
day. The records will help motivate you and prove your progress. Why don't you write me in 3 weeks and 
let me know how you are doing? </p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I recently purchased medicine balls to help strengthen the 5th &amp; 6th grade boys.  Do you know of any drills that would be helpful?  They really have some talent but they aren't very strong.
Thanks
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>I like using heavy basketballs for building strength and coordination. Heavy
objects slow the player movements down so you can focus more easily on technique. 
One drill we use is to place 3 or 4
players in the middle of a circle. The remaining players are on the outside of
the circle, about 12' from the inner players. You can use multiple heavy
balls. I like to mix in some normal weight balls and even some tennis balls once
the kids get the hang of the drill. The inner players each have a ball and the
drill starts by them passing their ball to an outer player. The outer player
then throws the ball to the next inner player. The ball makes its way around the
circle alternating between inner and outer players. You can use as many balls
as you have inner players. Keep all the balls going in the same direction,
however, you can signal a change in direction and see how the players adjust.
You can vary the type of passes somewhat, although medicine balls aren't too
good for bounce passes! Insist on proper form, of course.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>where can i find a detailed list of adjustments to offenses and defenses. For example, if the 
defense is playing a 3-2 zone, what offense should i be running? if an offense is running a 1-4, 
what defense should i be using? I would like to know if a list exists that cover all these and 
other situations. Thank you for your help.</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Don't know of such a list, but let me ask you this... do you really think you can teach your team 
a offense to counter every possible defense? Pick two patterns you like, one for m2m and one for zone; or, 
try the Simplified Triangle on this site. Get real good at the offense(s) you pick. Then, let the 
defense make adjustments to you rather than you reacting to the defense. If you try to learn too many 
offenses, you end up mastering none and you're not going to be very effective against any defense. The 
kinds of offensive adjustments you should try to make involve tempo. When you have the ball, you have 
the power to dictate the game pace. A good way to bust a zone is to flat beat them down the floor. I 
hope this helps. Learning offensive plays is time consuming and doesn't really account for that 
big a percentage of your score.</p>

        <p>I favor the 131 as a halfcourt trapping press. It is very effective against younger teams. 7th 
grade girls are capable of learning its concepts. I have been considering diagramming the 131 for my 
next article. Stay tuned - should be up in about a week.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>This will be my 1st year coaching a middle school basketball team (girls) and was struggling 
with how to structure try-outs.  How should drills/scrimmages be ordered, what kind of drills, 
how long should scrimmages last, how to pick players, do I need to use checklists to evaluate 
players, etc.  Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>It is hard to answer your question in this brief format. Basically, use conditioning drills to 
see who has the will to work hard. You will eliminate some early that have no interest in strenuous 
exercise. Use drills to examine the base skills seperately - dribbling, passing, shooting. Use 3 on 3 
to evaluate game skills. Some players get hidden 5 on 5 in tryouts. Checklists are nice, but are 
hard to use. Also - its difficult to objectively put a number on abilities. There is a tryout article 
on this site and a chapter of Ed Riley's book Coaching Youth Basketball Year 2 has input from three 
coaches on tryouts.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I am a relatively new Coach to an Under 14 Boys School Team.
Most of the fella's are short compared to the other teams we play against.
Could you offer some advice on how these guys may play defence against fella's much taller 
than them. Around the key, they just are'nt able to slow down or halt the other players as 
they just reach over the top of my guys to shoot or pass and my lads become quite frustrated 
in not being able to stop them. What can I do?</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>The tall player's advantage is greatest near the basket, so wage your battle as far from the 
basket as you can. Hopefully, you have some speed. If your short and slow, even being really smart 
and skilled may not be enough. Commit your defensive strength to the middle of the court with 
a press, trapping whenever you can. If your recover their turnovers, you can score without dealing 
with their height advantage as you will when you run a half court offense. Once they beat your press, 
all you can do is try to induce long shots and box out. You can prevent passes inside by fronting the 
post players, but it's defeinitely going to be an &quot;uphill&quot; battle.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I have a kid who has a good three point shot but when ever we have games he has a hard time making them. I  was wondering if you had any tips on making his percentage of three pointers in games go up. </p>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Shooting confidence for most kids comes after a lot - and I mean a lot - of
practice. Once a players &quot;knows&quot; he can make a shot, he will. In practice, you can use competitive 
shooting drills. In competitive drills, there is always a consequence for missing a shot and 
reward for making it. I like drills where we keep score or see how many we can make in a row. The 
consequences are minor, maybe pushups or a sprint, and the rewards may simply be that the player 
or his group &quot;won&quot; the drill. But after several times of making the drill-winning shot, the player 
is more accustomed to the pressure and can focus on execution. Good question.</p>

        <p>I need information on the triangle offense PLEASE HELP!</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Thanks for your question.<p>
        <p>I have an article in on the site called, 
&quot;Simplified Triangle Offense&quot;. I used the concepts there to teach the offense to

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>hi i just turned 15 and i am 6'2-6'4 some were around there but i cant jump that high i cant hit the rim how do i get up there i jump off my left leg and my right leg is strongest can any one help me this is my first year in basket ball so i need help</p>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Seems like you have some good height working for you. Size is a real natural advantage you should 
learn how to use. One, you can intimidate shooters just by keeping your hands up. Don't foul. Two, 
Location is more important than leaping. Learn the best positioning and use your body to make 
space near the basket. Three, getting to the ball quickly is more useful than jumping high. That 
means keeping your hands up and jumping quickly (not high).</p>

        <p>To practice, look at my new article &quot;1<a href="happyfeet.html">0 Steps to Happy Feet&quot;.</a> That will help your coordination jumping 
off either foot. Another exercise to to stand directly under the basket and see how many times in 
30 seconds you can jump off both feet and touch the bottom of the backboard. Jumping is a 
coordination skill. Jump rope helps, too. You will slowly improve with practice, so keeping trying to touch the rim, first 
off one foot, the the other. You'll get it.</p>

        <p>Hi, I will be coaching my daughter's 6 and 7 year old team.  I went to school on a basketball

Do you have any ideas or drills that might help me out?  I'm really looking forward to this and 
want to make it a good experience for the girls.  Thanks!.

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>Coach,  we recently faced an quick aggressive team that had a very effective 2-2-1 press.  We emphasize trying to get the ball to the middle to break just about any press, but this 2-2-1 press was extremely effective at taking the middle away.  When we tried passing up the sideline, we ran into the usual trap.  Our solution during the game was to reverse the ball, but we seemed to have run into the same problems.  One more thing, the pressing team had a very smart and athletic girl deep to read the long pass.  Any ideas we could try to implement in our next practice?</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>The 221 is a very common press. You are right in trying to break it in the
middle. Driving or passing up the sides is playing into its strength. The 221 is
just a zone. You beat a zone by overloading it. When one of your girls goes to
the middle, they are force to cover her. That means some defensive player must
break formation. Why not plan for that?</p>
        <p>The 221 doesn't contest the in bound pass, typically, so you just need an
inbounder and a receiver up front. The best opportunity is to pass right back
to the inbounder who already breaking downcourt. The momentum will clear the first two defenders and 
you already have an imbalance.</p>
        <p>But, what if that doesn't work? Then, I like your furthest player downcourt to double back and cut 
to the middle of the court. The advantage is that she is coming from behind the midcourt defense and it is 
harder to see her coming. To cover her, one of the two midcourt defenders must leave their post. 
If you've stationed your two remaining people on each side of the mid-court, one will then be open.</p>
        <p>Don't be too rigid on your offensive formation. Its not like a certain setup always beats a
221. Good presses always distort to adapt to the offense anyway. Like any effective zone offense, pass 
quickly and cut to the areas. And... be patient.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>In reference to the article on the simplified triangle offense, if both cutters cut and neither receives the ball is the option an isolation for the post man? </p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>If both cutters go by, there will be a hole for the post to follow. Cutters create a vaccuum 
in their wake. Posts should fake handoffs, then follow for their own shot. Some kids have a real 
knack for this. If no move is possible, kick the ball out. The weak side guard should have rotated over 
to serve as an outlet.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>i have been coaching at a park near by ages 12 through 17. i have enjoyed it so much that i 
want to make a career move and try coaching at the high school level. i have talked to a 
counselor at a community college and besides taking some classes he suggested finding out 
what the requierments were for high school coaches. do you have any info that would help me?</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>The way I got in was to volunteer for a couple years. This is a good approach. You'll learn a 
great deal from the coaching staff and there's a bunch of school related things you need to be 
on top of. Most recreational league coaches have no idea how much is involved at the high school 
level. Also, you'll probably need to be certified and receive 1st aid training. These are good things 
for you anyway. The main thing that runs off volunteer coaches is the degree of commitment required. 
I have seen several that last a month or so, then disappear. You need to be willing to make every 
practice as wellas every game, bus ride and coaches meeting. If you prove you can do that, you'll 
have a big head start when a paid job opens up. Or... you may find tha the volunteer job suits you 
perfectly. Good luck.</p>

also i would like to know of any individual drill that will help my dribbling skills?</p>
        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I like the crossover, right hand to left hand, to happen as the ballhander steps back with left foot. 
Always protect the ball with the body and space. Just practice in the driveway a lot, starting slow to 
perfect the skill. This is a good skill, but not a critical skill. Don't neglect your shooting and 
passing to get better at a crossover.

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>My name is Dean and I am a jv high school basketball player my position is the 2 and the 3 my problem is that when I catch the ball in the corner near the base line there is always someone coming to trap me. Teams catch on that I have a very good shot so they focus on me when I get hot basically with a trap. My point guard has a problem of not coming to help fast enough so I end up going base line trying to get the big man the ball or I try slipping through and pulling up for a shot but I am off balance do you have any other good suggestions on how to move out of a trap.</p>
        <p>You are playing in the weakest part of the court. The corner is the lowest percentage shot, and 
if you hesitate or drive baseline, you're easy to trap. So, keep the ball moving towards the middle 
of the court, as a rule. Don't blame your point guard. He probably doesn't want to pass the ball 
into a risky area.<hr>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Man guarding ball fights through all screens, man guarding screener steps back to provide room for 
teammate being screened, teammates watch for ball handler to beat defender then step up as early as 
possible to help stop the ball. Lots of talk. </p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I have a question about guards following their shots? I have argued that guards, particularly those farthest from the basket, should not follow their shots, but instead should be aware of the other team's guards heading up the court for a breakaway.  Am I right?  Should guards follow all of their shots, or should they be aware of the other teams heading off to the races for a fast break?
Your feedback is much appreciated
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>I would agree as long as the guards are shooting near the top of the key. If they are shooting from the 
corners, they might as well crash the boards. Since threes bounce further, they should watch the course of the ball and plan 
for a long rebound. The defense will have their backs to them, so they have an advantage slipping into the best position. 
If the point guard, for example, shoots a three and follows (or penetrates, 
leaving the top of the key open), its a good idea for a wing to rotate into his 
spot, both for defense and to provide an outlet pass route.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>hi, Im nick and i can jump 2 feet but  i want to know how high my vertical jump should be at age 14?</p>
        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>Thanks for your question in the Coach's Notebook. There is no guide for
jumping height according to age because kids grow at all different rates. Just
look around among your friends and classmates and you'll see what I mean. If you
have a 24&quot; vertical, you're doing pretty well. You're old enough to start
working with weights. Do toe raises, power lifts, jump on one foot and stand
under the back board an see how many time you can touch the bottom of the
backboard in 30 seconds. Be patient, give your body time to grow and rest. Good
luck.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>Is there any formal education a basketball coach would need if he has set his sites on coaching in the NBA someday?
Also, what is that basketball coaches have in common other than having played basketball earlier on in their career?
Thanks for your cooperation and efforts.</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Formal education? No. Basketball coaches come from everywhere. You need to work your way 
  up the ranks, though. Start at the highest level you can as an assistant. Learn from your 
  head coach and make contacts. Allow several years to grow. Attend camps. Use the internet 
  to converse with other coaches. Volunteer coach anywhere you can. You do not need to be 
  a prominent former player, but it does serve to provide some credibility and help you get 
  started. Doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a better coach, not at all. Commonalities include a love 
  for the sport and the players. Love it enough to do it for free. Bear in mind that I have never 
  coached in the NBA or even in college, so not the best person to advise. Wish you luck in 
  your ambition, though.

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>What kind of defense would you suggest against a team that primarily goes to their center for scoring, but also has two guards that can hit threes when you play off them?</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>My defensive preferences are simple. I would front their center and keep the pressure on the 
  guards to make passing as difficult as possible. Your other post defender will need to help against 
  lob passes. All this works within the man to man defense.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>what is an assist </p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>An assist is the pass leading to a basket. All you need to do is find the
open man and pass him the ball. Now, if the pass is made, and the receiver makes a move to get open, 
then because the man had to move to get open,
there is no assist. If you find an open man, pass him the ball, and he takes a couple dribbles 
uncontested to the basket, its still an assist because the dribbles were not a factor in getting 
the man open. </p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>I coach a CYO Boys team that will be playing at the 5th grade level next year. Although we only play man defense all our opponents play zone. Up to now we have played a very simple triangle with little movement and no screens. 
        <p>My team is quite talented, but I need to install a more effective zone offense (when we can't fast break). I must have 25 books on coaching but have been unable to find an offense that has all 5 players in motion with screens. I would like to have 2 zone motions, against odd and even fronts. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
        <p>Mark </p>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Coach, I hope I don't disappoint you, but I am really in favor of simple offensive patterns for players 
  that age. I think its much wiser to focus on skills (shooting, passing, rebounding and ballhandling). 
  If the kids are well grounded with those fundamentals, and can recognize the openings in the two and 
  three man situations (such as your triangle offense likely provides), then they will be well 
  prepared for their later teams. If you wish to vary even/odd guard fronts, that's great, but I 
  feel they should be fairly creative against zones with the understanding how to move the defense 
  through overloads and quick passing. I wouldn't attempt 5 players in motion against a 
  zone - too complicated. The screening I will use against a zone is usually just to rub off one of the perimeter 
players.</p>
        <p>Do you have a player that can play the high post spot against a 
  zone? If so, you have a real prize. So, my advice is keep it real simple and fun. Sounds like you're 
  doing a wonderful job.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>Hello. I am a college student who wants to walk on to my university team. I would know coaches give their players off season manuals of what they want them to do, I was wondering if you or another coach could e mail me something like that so I can improve for the fall, thank you
        <p>Jay Otero</p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>I think you should contact your prospective coach ASAP. Let him know you are interested and ask him 
  what he thinks you should do. Don't be like me ... I tried to walk on at a division I school without 
  an introduction and was deservedly cut. I found out the real players had already been together
   privately for weeks. I was too late and didn't even know it. Contact the coach and be assertive about it.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I have been a PE teacher/JV basketball coach for 6 years.  I want to be a High School head coach.  My record is 122-18 and I have made significant contribution to the varsity programs that I have coached under.  I played for a NCAA div. II school and played briefly for the Fort Wayne Fury(CBA)( that is to say that I got scouted and picked up and played summer league).  I keep running into the same problems when I go for head coaching interviews.  The parents play a big part in the interview process. Basically, they want me to play their son no matter what and allow them to tell me how to coach.  Is there any way that I can answer these questions diplomatically without compromising myself or control of the program and still get the job?  </p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>The object is to get the job and the parents have a big say in who gets the
job, so the trick is to avoid alienating the parents while maintaining your
principles. Is  that a fair assessment? </p>
          <p>One of my strongest points as a coach has been parent 
relationships, and that doesn't mean I play their kids unfairly or take direction from parents. I do 
believe in playing every kid every game. I also believe in making parents a part of the team. I need 
the parents in so many ways. Do I listen to them tell me how to coach? You bet. Does it dictate my 
style? No, but I do get the benefit of some good ideas from time to time. If you read the article 
Coaching Philosophy on this site, you'll get a more cohesive idea what I am suggesting.</p>
          <p>I think you should take a high level, &quot;kids first&quot; approach in your interview. Talk about building 
a team in a larger sense, based on players and their families. Stress that you expect and value 
contribution from every player and every parent. Who can argue or feel threatened with that?</p>
          <p>Trouble with many coaches is that they are too defensive. It doesn't cost anything to be nice and 
to listen to parents. Parents who have a say don't complain much. Parents who help rarely complain 
at all. Players who get to participate are motivated and enthusiastic. Coaches who like parents are 
liked in return. I don't see where an open approach necessarily compromises a coach.</p>
          <p>Good luck. I'm interested in your results and comments. Email me at sjordan@alaskalife.net

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I would like to reword my last question. Sorry to be a burden, but my dad used to coach high school basketball at the varsity level and he loved it but quit so he could watch me play at the college level. He never had a teaching liscense because he did not have to have one in the state of Indiana. But today he found out they changed the rule and he must have one. I also for this reason have been pursuing a different degree because I thought I could coach without having a teaching liscence. My dream and his is to coach so I was wondering if there was any place where a teaching liscence was not necessary at the high school or college level. Thanks.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I don't know, state by state, where coaches are required to have teaching certificates. I do know 
that being a certified teacher is a big advantage even where it is not required. In Alaska, a teaching 
certificate is not required, but preference is given in the following order: qualified teacher in the 
school, qualified teacher in another school, qualified school district employee, and finally a 
qualified coach outside (not employed by) the school system.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>We have a U11/5th grade boys AAU team. We have played 40 games so far this season trying to 
gear up for the state AAU tournament. We play excellent the first game of the day or night but 
when we have a several hour layoff between games we seem to come out sluggish and don't play nearly as well. Any suggestions as to what to do with the team during this time, things to or not to eat, etc. would be much apprediated.
Thanks,
Larry</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I think meal timing is very important. Have the players eat about 2 hours
before their game. On bus trips, I found it helpful to bring snacks - cut oranges, breakfast bars - 
so they would have energy resources by game time. Another thing about tournaments, don't hang around 
the gym all day. Get out of there after your game and go do something fun (without being strenuous). The 
break will work well for you - much more than scouting the competition.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I play basketball for my high school team, I have an awseome inside range (15 feet) 
but struggled a little with my 3-point jump shot this year. So then I moved to my set shot 
(which is usually pretty good) for three pointers, but then it screwed up my jump shot.  
Should I have just stuck with my jump shot? And are there any websites, books , etc. that 
could really help my game for next season? If you could help me I'd really be thankful, Mike. 
P.S. I'm only a 5'11 shooting guard.
          </p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>You're big enough now that you should be feeling comfortable shooting a jump shot in the 
three point range. If you cannot shoot that far without distorting your form, then you need to 
investigate mechanical problems within your shot. Check out the shooting articles by Tom Norland 
that have been posted on my site. There many good tips there to help your shooting.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>hey i am in the 8th grade i am 5-3 105 i want to play bball in high school what can 
i do to jump higher? and how should i work on my strengh and endurance? also give me 
some tips on spot up shooting on the dribble (stop and pop) i cant get my hands on the 
ball right if i shoot it too fast</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Tips: Pick your shooting spot a little ahead of time. Instead of initiating your 
jump shot at some random moment, visually select a spot in an open area, perhaps just 
beyond a screener. That way, you are totally prepared and your timing will benefit. Also, 
be ready to shoot before you catch the ball - hands up and in position. The instant you 
catch the ball, you should be ready to fire.

          <p>Here are some vertical improvements I copied from egroups.com/coaching-basketball:</p>
          <p>Everybody wants to jump&nbsp; higher, run faster and be more explosive, but not 
many&nbsp; individuals are willing&nbsp;to pay the necessary price&nbsp; to create&nbsp; the&nbsp; 
desired improvements in these areas . The&nbsp; following drills will 
show improvement&nbsp; if they are&nbsp; done two or three&nbsp; times a week&nbsp; over a two month&nbsp; 
period&nbsp; for approximately 20 minutes a session . THEY WORK !!! 

          <p>ALL of these drills are done -10 second bursts,&nbsp; because generally, 
basketball is played&nbsp; in 10 - seconds&nbsp; or less bursts :

          <p>1. Jump Rope Simulation - 10 seconds each ,3 sets as fast as&nbsp; you jump <br>a. 2 
foot jump - feet shoulder-width apart <br>b. Right leg only <br>c. Left leg only 
          <br>d. Jumping jack legs move as if&nbsp; doing jumping jacks <br>e. Wide base - 
feet&nbsp; as wide as&nbsp;&nbsp; possible ( stay wide ) <br>f. Split&nbsp; legs&nbsp; forward and back 
(switch as quickly as you can ) <br><br>2. Line Jumps - 10 seconds each , 3 
setes&nbsp; keep hands above ears <br>a. Forward and back split - one foot over line 
, other&nbsp; foot behind <br>line then switch&nbsp; repeatedly <br>b.&nbsp; Side of foot next 
to line - Jump back and forth <br>c. Switch over top and behind <br>d. Straddle- 
left leg on top , right&nbsp; leg behind&nbsp; , jump over line <br>e. Stradle - right leg 
on top( same as d) <br><br>3. Explosive Jumps - 8 jumps of each,3 sets&nbsp; . Keep&nbsp; 
hands above&nbsp; ears <br>a. Double&nbsp; leg&nbsp; truck&nbsp; jumps - jump up and&nbsp; bring&nbsp; knees 
to chest land&nbsp; and immediately jump up again - repeat<br><br>b. Glute kicks 
- jump up and&nbsp; bring&nbsp; heels to butt , and repeat <br>c. Lateral jumps&nbsp; as far 
as you can side to side, land on both feet, Immediately jump back laterally, 
repeat <br>d. Forward and back - jump forward as far as you can, then backward, repeat <br>e. Single leg tuck jumps - hold left leg at right angle jump up 
and bring <br>Left&nbsp; leg to chest. Keep&nbsp; right leg at right angle, it does 
not move, repeat. <br>f. Single&nbsp; leg tuck&nbsp; jumps - hold&nbsp; left leg at right&nbsp; 
angle, bring&nbsp;leg to chest, repeat <br>g. Split&nbsp; jumps -&nbsp; right leg to 
forward, left leg back, jump&nbsp; up and bring back on landing. 
          <br><br>4.Partner jumps - partner gently puts hands on shoulders of&nbsp; jumper 
          <br>a. Two feet - jump as high as possible, repeat 10 times <br>b. One leg - 10 
jumps <br>c. Other&nbsp; leg - 10 jumps <br><br>5. Across Court - length&nbsp; of 
basketball court .Keep hands above ears <br>a. Repeat standing broad jumps - 
jump off 2 feet, land ,jump as <br>quickly as <br>Possible, down the court 
          <br>b. Lateral jumps- shoulder points to end of court, jump sideways, land on Both feet, repeat <br>c. Lateral Jumps - point other&nbsp; shoulder to end 
of&nbsp; court, jump&nbsp; sideways, land on&nbsp; both feet, repeat <br>d. Double&nbsp; leg 
zig zag -&nbsp; both feet&nbsp; together, jump in zig - zag the Length of the court 
          <br>e. Single leg zig - zag -- same as d , but jump on right leg only <br>f. 
Single leg&nbsp; zig - zag&nbsp; -- other&nbsp; foot <br>g. Repeated double leg split down 
court <br>h. Repeated single leg&nbsp; tuck jump&nbsp; down court <br>i. Repeated single 
leg tuck jump&nbsp; down court, other leg <br>j. Power skips -- with maximum height, 
jump the length of the court <br>&nbsp; <br>6. Upper Body quick workout <br>a. Do one 
push up, go to knees and do one shoulder press <br>b. Do&nbsp; 2 push&nbsp; ups, go to 
knees and do 2 shoulder presses, etc <br>c. Repeat until you can t do anymore -- 
a good goal is to build up to 15 

          <p>These drills should&nbsp; be done 
on a soft surface like a gym floor or grassy area, so as to lessen the&nbsp; 
shock on knees. Also never do these drills two days in a row -- always take 
at least one day off afther this workout: These drills will make you 
better if done over time GOOD LUCK!

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>what are the responsibilities of an Athletic Director?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I expect that role may change from school to school. I would guess that the primary 
duty would be scheduling all the athletic activities - what a nightmare! - including gym 
use for practice and outside events. The AD should have input on new coach hires and 
policies, and also budget administration. For a more authoritative answer, ask an 
Athletic Director.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Hi I'm 14 years old and I am 6'3'' 188cm.  Every body thought I was going to be a huge centre 
but I am realising I'm not going to grow much more.  Last year I worked at my dribbling and now 
I'm point guard for my team, even though I'm the tallest.  I am very quick and jump farely high 
29 inches.  Where would you see me in 6 years time?
My problem is that there is alot of talk that I should not play point guard any more because of my 
height.  But if I don't get use to playing point guard I won't be ready for the big league.
Do you recomend any drills to make my dribbling skills incredible.
What I use to do is practice normal dribbling then through my legs and behind my back etc.
I would really appreciate your help because I think I've got the potential to make it all the 
way to the N.B.L I live in Australia.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>At 14, you still have growing left. Although you may not be huge, you'll definitely be tall. Do you 
think Magic Johnson was a great point guard? (Nod yes) He was also a great forward and great center. 
He could play everywhere. Maybe that is a reason why he was so good at point. Is there any chance you can play 
on multiple teams? What if you were a post player on a team near your own age and also a point guard 
for a team of older kids? Look at the NBA's big people - more and more have good ball handling skills 
so it seems like you're heading the right way. I wouldn't worry much about choosing a position 
right now. Just build your overall skills. As you get older, your future teams may need you to play 
in different spots. Perhaps your best attribute in the eyes of scouts will be your versatility.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>

          <p>
Coach- My girlfriend played a number of sports in high school, with basketball being one of them.  
She is always complaining about her legs being too big and muscular.  I am fine with how 
they look but she still seems uncomfortable with them.  I am trying to help her out and 
I was wondering, do you know of any workouts to solve this or someplace that would?  
Thank you for you time and I hope to hear from you soon!
-Nate</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Now that's an original question! However, the only exercise I know to make one's legs less 
muscular is no exercise. and where's the fun in that? I suggest staying in sports and enjoying the 
power you have. Some folks work real hard for just a little extra musculature.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Do you have any suggestions in how to attack a high 2-3 zone defense?  I coach 8th grade boys 
who are very good 20-2 this year, but one teams plays this against us the entire game.  It pushes 
our offense way high and wide and really takes us out of it .  I have a great point guard and 
another quick off guard who can shoot, but this team is very quick and seems to anticipate every 
pass....any suggestions would be helpful...we play them again next week in a tournament....</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Sounds like you may be a bit over-reliant on your offensive set. I like to take advantage of 
whatever the defense offers. It requires that you give the kids a lot of freedom, though. If the 
defense extends itself, it just opens new doors of opportunity. Even if a team is good at 
anticipating passes, the odds are still in the offense's favor - passes are faster than people. 
Fake passes and some anticipation by your own guys can work wonders. Get them in the mind set of 
&quot;toying&quot; with the opponent. The offense can be manipulative with enough confidence.  There should 
be holes for your shooting guard to pop into... how about some high post action? Post flashes to 
the top of the key, gets a pass back to the guard cutting by ... have some fun with it.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Hi -
I am coaching an 8th grade girls basketball team that finished the regular season 10-0.  
The problem is that in the post season tournment we were moved up a division and drew the 
first place team in that division.  I have not seen this team play but have talked to other 
coaches and know that they are a big, athletic and quick team.  I have been working on a 
game plan that I think will work but need some assistance.  My plan, so far, is to use a 
variety of different defenses: half court man traps, full court zone traps and to apply 
constant pressure on the ball.  My thought is to try and keep them off balance so they cannot 
establish any offensive rhythm.  On offense, I want to spread out the offense and force them 
to guard us man to man so that I can use the speed and athletic ability of my point guards.  
I also think that from this spread set I can use the one on one coverage to give my low post 
players a better chance to score without getting their shots blocked.  I think that if we can 
control the ball for most of the game we have a better chance of winning.  
Do you have any suggestions.  Thanks for listening. - Joe Peabody
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Coach Peabody, the plan sounds fine, although complicated for 8th graders. You know better than 
me what your team can do. I think its better to do a few things very well than several things done 
not so well. However, if your team is well drilled in pressing, you can change the formation and they 
will pick it up quickly. Press principles are constant, no matter which configuration you use. 
Sometimes, if you are athletically outclassed, a zone will help you keep the ball outside and will 
also slow the game down to your favor. Good luck.</p>

          <p>How to get a higher vertical quick and easy</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>If you want quick and easy, jump off a table. Any realistic plan will require work. Remember, if
 something  is quick and easy to do, everyone will be good at it. You need to build strength and 
 quickness and that, my friend, will take some time and effort.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I am very weak at dribbling with my left hand.....can you give me some tips on increasing 
my speed on my left hand?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>You just need to use it! I have had some kids go from zero left hand to pretty good in just one 
season, but it takes daily practice and understanding of the fundamentals - fingertips on the ball,
 firm push to the floor (nothing soft) and close to the body. Spend a half hour a day doing simple 
 repetitions, then added movement from one place to the next. Don't try cross overs and hesitations 
 until you're really solid with basic movement. Give yourself a goal - say two weeks of daily 
 practice - and see how good you get in that time!</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>The other night at a basketball game, a shot came close to hitting the bar on top of the basket.  It hit the tip of the top of the backboard.  The ref by half court did not make a call (which we all assumed was correct) but the ref under the basket blow his whistle saying it hit the bar.  The coach of the offended team went crazy since his team got the rebound and was given a technical.
I assume there is no rule saying which ref should make that call but shouldn't the ref under the basket be looking at the people under the basketball and not watching the ball?
Is there any way for the other ref to override this call if he knows it did not hit the obstruction?  If so, can that negate the technical?
Thanks. </p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>The referees share responsibilities even though they each have their own areas to concentrate upon. So, if the 
referee under the basket believed the ball hit the support, he should make the call. It doesn't really 
matter where he &quot;should&quot; have been watching. Now, if an official is clearly convinced that his partner made 
a mistake, they should confer and decide is the call should be changed. In this case, one referee 
was quite close to the situation so I can understand if his partner accepted the call. Referees are 
partners (I use that word deliberately) so they will trust each other's judgment and back each 
other up unless its obvious one ref didn't see the violation.</p>

          <p>As for negating the technical ... I don't see that happening. The tech was
probably for poor sportsmanship. An error by the ref doesn't give a coach the right to go ballistic.
 In this case, the coach lost control of himself and hurt his team. Blaming his actions on the 
 referees isn't very responsible, is it?</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p> This is my first year coaching boys jv basketball. I would love to install the 2-3 matchup zone were can i find info on this zone?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I am looking for a good write-up and will post it here. </p>

          <p>OK, here's a link you can vist:<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~coacheshome/matchup.htm">
http://members.tripod.com/~coacheshome/matchup.htm</a> </p>

          <p>From Coach Mac on Chalk Talk: I posted a description in January but will
summarize it here. Play man2man sagging off with your hands up. If a cutter goes
thru, stay with him until you get close to another defender, then stop and cover
his man/area and he slides over to defend the cutter (basically a switch). You
are matched up as in man but you are sagging with your hands up as in a zone.
You don't defend an empty area since you are matched to a man, but you are only
tight on the man with the ball and defending low posts. To further confuse the
offense, call out various zone formations or even &quot;man&quot; as you set up
each time. Just make sure your own team knows you are in the match up zone or
they may get confused, too. To further confuse them, switch between man, zone,
and the matchup zone with one of your players calling the defense. If you work
with a shot clock, it can play havoc with a team that runs different sets
against man and zone if you switch defenses on the fly and they have to reset
each time. Also, as the shot clock winds down and a lot of teams go to a flat
1-4 low set to isolate a player 1 on 1, switching to a straight zone will kill
them. It is hard to get a good shot quickly against a zone. </p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I have a 17 year old daughter who is a greater shooter. At the 3 point range she can come out at half time or in practice and hit one right after the other. She is a team player but gets verly frustrated when she can't hit the 3 in a game situation when she knows she should be able to. She can hit 10 for 10 3,s with no problem, just not in a game. How can she get to the next level.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Perhaps its just that her confidence changes - shooting can be such a mind
game - but maybe the excitement of the game is making her change her shot in a
subtle way. Watch her form closely. Is it different? Does she rush her shots?
These can be easy things to fix. If its all in her mind, then you need to get her
used to shooting under pressure. Create competitive situations in practice where she must 
hit the shots - like buying back conditioning laps. Or have timed contests ... use your imagination. 
Once she gets accustomed to making shots under simulated pressure, tyhe game performance may improve. </p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>i am 21 and playing for an intramural basketball team at UW-Madison. My problem is that my team is extremely small relative to the other teams. I stand 6'1&quot; and I am the tallest player on the team. We got killed in the paint tonight and am looking for a possible defense in order to assist underneath. We only have seven players that play and only 5 that are decent so pressing probably won't be an option. thanks in advance for your advice </p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Don't be too quick to dismiss the press idea - you don't need to press the entire game. You will 
benefit by doing battle away from the basket where you are strong, rather than close where you are 
disadvantaged. Try an extended half court zone. You have no choice but to combat size with speed, 
hustle and outright chicanery.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>what is the most difficult thing about becoming a coach and what should coaches do to overcome it?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Becoming a coach? Hmmm... most organizations require some form of certification, so you may need 
to complete a coaching class and a first aid course. A new coach may need to face his/own feelings 
of inadequacy (like can I be responsible for others) and conquer them, take criticism well, command 
the attention of players, things like that. Generally, people who stay in coaching do so because they 
are born to it. Its in their nature to be in control and accomplish feats through others. Parents who 
start coaching to support their own kids may need grow into the role. On the other hand, there is 
no ideal coaching model. Each individual must understand their strengths and weakness and use them to 
best do the job.</p>

          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I can't pick one of your two choices as they are not mutually exclusive. Important roles a coach 
must fulfill are teacher, organizer, safety advocate, role model and being the players' &quot;#1 fan&quot;.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Hello,
          <p>
  This is my first year coaching. I coach a Varsity Boys Basketball Team at a Christian School. I am a 22 year old female and I have a hard time getting one of the boys to respect me. (the rest of them have come to respect me and listen to me.) Do you know what I can do to get the respect that I deserve? 
 My next question is, is it too late in the season to teach new things? I feel that we learned quite a bit at the first of the season and now we should just be perfecting what we learned. One of the boys keeps telling me that he wants to learn something new now, but we only have four more games left. Any suggestions?
          <p>Thanks alot, Nicole DeFilippo </p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>To get respect, you must first respect yourself. Provide a plan, follow it. Be fair. Listen and 
respect your players' opinions and ideas. Understand your own values (which may be difficult due to 
your youth) well enough to write them down and define your coaching philosophy. I did this recently 
and it really helped me. Click <a href="philosophy.html"> here </a> to see... Don't blame lack of respect on your gender, just be a 
sincere coach. If a kid can't deal with the fact that his coach is a woman, that's his problem 
and maybe he can deal with it by not being on the team.</p>
          <p>Its never too late to learn new things. I would avoid a radical change in tactics at the end of the 
season, but I like introducing new drills, OB plays, etc. throughout the season. Good luck, coach.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>My 3,4,5th grade girls team had a game today.  While we were on offense, the other team had a 
player who while fronting my center,had her arms wrapped behind herself, and around my player.  
I questioned the league commissioner about a holding foul, and he said that it was only a foul 
if my offensive player tried to run thru the defensive player, and the defensive player continued 
to hold onto the offensive player.  Can a player phsically wrap their arms around a player to the 
extent that my player cannot move?  Thank you</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>The defensive player is only entitled to the space her body occupies, and that does not include 
extensions of the arms or legs. However, referees will permit touching in many circumstances, 
including the one your describe, if the player is merely &quot;finding&quot; the opposing player. Refs allow 
even more contact when players are boxing out and spread themselves wide. But, when a defensive 
player inhibits the offensive player's movement by extending an arm or leg or hip ... prepare to 
hear the whistle blow.</p>

growth... i want to know because i hope to be a centre but i am really too short..i am 17 years old

          <h3>
          </h3>
          <p>Playing basketball doesn't make you taller, it just makes you better at playing basketball. Which is 
more important - be a good player or being tall? Which of the two can you control? Have fun with the 
sport and don't worryabout your height.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I am a 6th grade girls basketball coach.  What are some good offenses to use against a 1-3-1 zone 
defense?  Also, how about an offense that plays a 3-2 defense with 3 girls up front? Coach Bill</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>There are a couple of plays in the article Easy Offensive Sets that can help against zone defense. 
Try the High-Low against the 131 (with the low post moving from corner to corner) and the Four-Out 
against a 32 zone. The main concept I try to teach the players are filling open areas offensively, 
overload one side of the floor, making the zone move with passing and penetration dribbles and being 
patient with shot selection. Experienced players adhering to these concepts can dissect a zone pretty 
well without a structured pattern.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>What is your best drill for attacking the net with your guards?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>You can use the shell drill (I like 4vs4) both as a defensive tool and as a tool for players to 
learn how to move the offense and take advantage. I encourage the players to try and penetrate. 
Hopefully the defense will anticipate and help out to stop the drive, but that just creates 
another offensive opportunity. Also, I have posted three layups drills (see the front page). Players 
can attack the basket in these drills using the post as a helper. You may insert a defensive player 
in the drill to help.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I coach 5th and 6th grade girls,of which all are 5th graders but one. We are short but
scrappy . We play good defense (m2m) and we are aggressive. My  question is this, we play the 
best team in the league Sat. they have a big  athletic girl inside who is their main scorer 
I have my best athlete guarding her, should I front her with this girl or play her normal and 
get help from other defenders?
          <p>We are 3 wins 2 loses. loses were by 1 point and 2 points the team mentioned above beat us 
by 2 in our first meeting. I have adhered to your advise of teaching fundamentals and keeping 
it simple while others teams are practicing plays we are dribbling and boxing out. This is a 
really good site and has been very useful. By the way we have only one 6th grader by choice, 
I knew the 5th graders and liked their attitudes.
          <p>David Winfield Al 35594</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Good job, Coach. Absolutely front their post. Most kids won't pass to some if there is a body 
in the passing lane. The only pass opening is a overhead lob pass. How do you beat that? Easy. 
Maintain high pressure on the ballhandler so they can't concentrate on the lob pass and do it well. 
Behind the big girl, on the weak side, your defenders should be cheating - sagging in the key - 
and they should anticipate that lob and go get it. You can shut the big scorer down if she can't 
get thqat ball and you aren't fouling her.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I am interested in coaching NCAA D-1 women's basketball someday.  I am trying to get into some Junior College work right now and I was told that a Master's degree is necessary in order to coach in college.  Is this true?  If so, should my Master's degree be in physical education?  I am currently a Physical Education teacher in Anaheim, CA.  Any information that you have would be greatly appreciated.  I am only 25 and want to start pursuing college basketball.  I played 4 years of college basketball but have not started to coach at that level  yet.
Thank you for your time. Amanda Waters 
Anaheim, CA
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I do not believe all D1 coaches have masters degrees, but it certainly may be
the rule at some programs. A physical education degree is definitely appropriate, but it seem very 
limiting to only hire coaches with that particular education background. If you have schools in mind 
for your coaching future, learn their eligibility requirements.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>How do you attack a triangle and 2 half court defense.  This is 
designed to stop your top two players.  In my case the point guard 
and our 4 man are considered our top players.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>There is an article on this site called Beating Junk Defenses. It has diagrams and explanations 
specifically for the Triangle and 2. Look in the Topics Menu, upper right.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Coach - I am a first year JV basketball coach at a vocational high school.  
I have the ability to teach basic techniques to my players, such as blocking out, 
teamwork and other fundamentals, but I lack the basic basketball acumen, the anlytical 
ability, to assess a game situation and respond.  I simply try to shuffle my personel until 
I find a combination that works.  I rely on my players to give me feedback on what is 
working, and I take their advice in making adjustments.  My team is 3-6 on the year, 
but there is no doubt that an experienced coach would have a better record with our talent.  
In short, I get my players to play hard, with heart, but I don't know how to be a good 
&quot;game coach&quot;.  Do you have any advice for me to expedite the learning process? 
Thank you for you time and advice.  Sincerely, Ed Fitzpatrick.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Don't beat yourself up over the losses. There's no guarantee a different coach would have 
changed the win-loss record. If your players are working hard and playing with heart, you have 
already achieved something significant as a coach. As far as advice, rehearse end-game scenarios 
in practice. Experiment with different tactics and different kids. Some will shine when the 
pressure is on and some will fold. Its part of their nature. Watch the kids in the game to see 
who is hot and who is not. If your star is having a horrible day and a sub is having a great one, 
who is most likely to succeed in the final big moment? Be more concerned about your teams 
performance and execution than in what the other coach is doing. If you are worried about 
countering the other coach's moves, you'll always be a step behind. Analyze other coach's decisions 
- like when you watch a college game on TV. What would you have done in the same situation? 
Lastly, watch for signs of fatigue in your players and be quick to take them out. If a player is tired, 
you will see uncharacteristic errors or hasty decisions. You want the kids to be successful 
as possible while they are on the court. Once a player is tired, chance are a fresh body will be 
more effective.</p>
          <p>As far taking advice from players, sometimes I will do that if I think they will perform better 
with a defense or a play they are most confident with. Generally, though I make the call and see 
what happens. </p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I am currently coaching a girl's Jv basketball team and have a question.
I have a girl who is pretty good size,(5'8&quot; maybe 160) and she has all
of the talent in the world. she can go inside and shoot the three, i know
this because she has proved over and over again in practice, but
whenever she get's in a game, she chokes, plays semi good d, get's 
7 or 8 points, and maybe 3 rebounds. She always comes out of the game with 
a disaproving look on her face and i think she is put down becauwe
she knows she has an ability to play on the next level. im in a bind
with this one, is there anyway i can get her motivated or give 
her a boost of confidence, I know she has the ability to drive
but when she has 1 person to stop her in the game, she chooses, she
pass. I need a little help thanx. Coach A</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I am trying to understand if this is a case of a player disgruntled because she is playing JV instead 
varsity or a case of a player with talent who lacks confidence to display it. I'd like to ask her why 
she plays basketball. Maybe she's trying to prove something as an individual and when the game 
doesn't go her way early, she gets discouraged. The secret to happiness is devoting efforts to team 
success. I often see players get upset because they miss a shot or two. So what? The only thing that 
really matters is that they made a good decision to shoot meaning that the shot was taken in the team's 
best interest. I try to take the pressure off the kids as shooters. We practice shooting, but I don't 
like to harangue on them for poor shooting percentage. Shooter's confidence is fragile. Hard to build 
and easy to destroy. Anyway, the point is to find out if she cares about team performance and how 
much does she want to contribute. If she is lost in her concern for her personal performance, then 
you know where your challenge lies.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I'm coaching  freshman girls high school team for the first time.  Two problems:
          <p>1) I was instructed to teach the freshman team the same plays as JV &amp; Varsity so we can be a 
farm team for them.  My girls never seem to finish a set play in a game.  They get intimidated by 
the defensive pressure and give up on the play before it has a chance to develop (so we simply go 
into crisis mode).  In addition they don't seem comfortable with where they should be on the floor.  
In spite of my instructions to teach &quot;to the play book&quot; I'm thinking of switching to a 
motion offense just to get them moving.  It's important to note that I don't get anywhere near the 
same amount of court time for practice as the othjer squads.  Any thoughts or suggestions?  
          <p>2)  Last night we ran into a very agressive half-court trap that ate us alive.  The defense 
sagged off the full court press only to pounce on us immediately after we crossed mid court.  
How do I tell my girls to handle this? - Mike Howard</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>1) You have an obligation to teach the program's offense to your freshman team. If you don't, the 
players will need to learn it next year. However, you don't need to teach it all at once. I have a similar 
situation with my freshman team. But, to run the varsity offense at the start of the season is a very 
complex and difficult task. So, I have broken the play down into layers. In our first game, all we 
had of the offense was the entry pass to the wing from the point and the point picked away. That was 
it. My team is so imexperienced that we had to solve the problems of taking care of the ball on and 
getting the ball to the wing under pressure before we could go any further. In that first game, we 
still managed to score 50 points off our defense and our rudimentary offense. Now we are five games 
into the season and we have the pass to the post, ball side posts picking for the weak side post, 
pick and roll and give and go options between the wing and the posts working for us. Since we 
are installing these in layers, the kids learn to recognize the openings the offense provides as it 
progresses. This plan is augmented by using 2on2 and 3on3 play in practice enforcing these elements.</p>

          <p>2) A good halfcourt trap/press intends to disrupt a set offense and never let it start. If you 
practice your offense with intense pass defense on your wings, your players will learn to use back 
door concepts to break free. Also, encourage players to flash into open areas to receive passes. A 
little creativity is OK. The defense is gambling by spreading the defense allover the floor. 
Take advantage of that. Once you demonstrate you can burn the extended defense, then they will back 
off and you can run your regular offense. Set your team up in a half-court trapping defense in 
practice so you can learn to beat it. If you haven't already, read the article &quot;Press Breaker&quot; on 
this site for more detailed tips. Thanks for your question.</p>

          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>There is an article on my site called Developing Your Big People. Read that.
It has many tips that can help you. In general, use your height to your&nbsp;
advantage. Since you&nbsp; are tall, whenever you have the ball, keep it high
over your head. Don't drop your hands down low where the smaller players can
grab the ball. Practice passing and shooting with the ball overhead. Make
people shoot over you by keeping your hands high. Don't try to block shots
because you will get fouls called on you. Just make shooting over you difficult
for others. You can avoid traps by acting quickly - shooting or passing - before the defense 
gets to you. Good luck.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I coach a 7th and 8th grade team (12 players). We don't have alot of speed on the team. Do you have any suggestions on how to handle a full court press?</p>

          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Read the article &quot;Press Breaker&quot;. Key points are taking your time, use a trailer so you can pass
 backward to avoid pressure and reverse the ball to the other side of the court, avoid traps and 
 progress the ball by passing, not dribbling. Remember, the defense is gambling and is spread 
 all over the floor. People can't run as fast as a ball can be passed. The odds are really in the 
 offense's favor if you stay calm.</p>

          <p>hi guys give me some help on breaking the diamond press.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Flash a player into the heart of the diamond and pass the ball there, then quickly pass upcourt. 
All presses are susceptible to quick passing. Its really a matter of moving to the open areas and 
passing intelligently. The key is to avoid the traps. Pass backwards to a trailer if you must, but 
keep the ball outof the traps.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Does height have anything to do with athletic ability</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Well, John Wooden wrote that at the end of the game when the players are all tired, 
the tall guys are still tall. Sure, height is an advantage in basketball. But, before it is
 an advantage, onen needs the prerequisites of conditioning, fundamental skills and talent. Height 
 gives you leverage, vision and gets your hands closerto the basket with less effort. However, 
 short people with skills and fortitude can be great players.</p>

          <p>Coach, What would be some good things to teach 5th and 6th graders in a youth league style basketball league? We just drafted our players and will begin our first practice on Saturday. Thanks Tony</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I always answer this question with encouragement to teach them to use both
hands dribbling and shooting. Its such a long process teaching left-handed
layups and basic ball handling to high schoolers. If kids in the tryouts can
do these fundamental things, they have a real competitive edge. Teach them man to man defense. The 
things to concentrate on are footwork, slide stepping, pass defense and helping (I call it cheating)
 when their man is away from the ball. Teach them pick and roll, give and go and how to handle 
 numerical advantages on fast breaks. </p>

          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Make sure all the kids have a fair chance to be seen doing the same skills. Don't pick a few talented kids and 
pay attention to them. Absolutely examine their basic skills - layups, mid range shooting, dribbling, 
both hands! Have them play some 3 on 3 to evaluate their level of game play. Also important, give them 
some strenuous drills to measure their fitness and tendancy to quit when tired.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I'm looking for rules, ethics, etiquette, etc, regarding the addition of new players to teams 
after the regular game season has started. I coach a small team in a small church league with a 
limited number of players available for those teams involved. Each week one of the teams shows 
up with additional (NOT replacement) players on the roster. Any feedback on this practice? Thanks.
Coach Mac</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Well, rules will vary according to the league. For example, high school players must have a certain 
number of practices in before they are eligible. Recreational leagues may have a minimal wait. For 
a team that grows as the season goes would certainly have playing time issues. Why aren't the new 
players provided to all teams in turn? It seems the league should balance the squads if new players are 
coming into the league, maybe have a tryout pool at some point. As far as etiquette, most coaches 
introduce a new player gradually, even if they are good enough start.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>   I have a 6th grade team, we are not the best outside percentage team however we can 
shoot but not on a good percentage.  However we can pretty much control the boards but 
the ball seemingly never gets down to our big men.  Can you help me find a play or an 
offense designed to go against the 1-3-1?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>A logical answer to the 1-3-1 is a 2-1-2: put you people where they are not. The main weakness 
to a zone is that the defensive players are restricted to areas. You can also overload the zone by 
placing 4 or 5 players on one side of the floor. For big people to get open, they need to move, 
pick for each other and understand how to create space by using their body when they post up. These 
techniques are discussed in the article &quot;<a href="bigplayer.html">Developing You Big
Player</a>&quot;.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I am a coach of a youth girls team (ages 10 to 13), my questions is how to score against a 
2-3 defense. To give you a little back ground on the players.  My center is my leading scorer 
and I have a great guard who can score outside and inside the other players are fair. 
What type of plays can I use to break down a the 2-3 defense?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>In the article <a href="easyplays.html"> Easy Offensive Sets, </a> try the Hi-Lo or the Four-Out. The combination of good outside 
shooting guard and talented center is powerful. You may try pick and roll on the defensive guard 
and see how they handle it.</p>

          <p>a discription of the career researched including specific tasks or responsibilities 
of an employee for being a basketball coach. advancement oppertunities. post secondary courses 
or certifications required for the positiion. approximate salary rang for the position (if posible). 
advantages/disavantages of working in this career. the appropriateness of the field for the student.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>What is your question, exactly? I do not hire coaches, so I do not have a job description prepared 
for publication - if that is what you want. I have published the questions and answers from my
          <a href="coachinterview.html">coaching interview </a> if that is any help. I am coaching a team by 
myself as well as holding down a very full time job. I like answering questions, but I need them 
to be specific to make best use of my time. A thoughtful response to all that I believe you're asking 
for requires more time than I can give you right now.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>What are some good tips for the 2 and 3 guards? </p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>Well, I can think of a zillion ... here's a few:
          <ol>
            <li>Keep your head up and look downcourt. Don't turn your back to your basket.</li>
            <li>Don't rely on your dribbling prowess. Pass the ball. It will come back.</li>
            <li>If your partner drives to the basket, move to the top of the key to protect against the fast break.</li>
            <li>Give your big men the ball - often. If you try to save your team with your outside shot, 
you will lose and your big people will lose motivation to work hard.</li>
            <li>After you pass, move! Players on the wings that pass and then stand there are useless.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I know that for a high school player, a good three point percentage is 30 % or above.  What is a good field goal percentage for a high school player?  For a team?  Thanks for your help.</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I shoot for 33% on threes, 60% on other field goals and 75% on free throws.
Look at the article entitled Analogies and read the section, Basketball is
like&nbsp; Money to see how the numbers can help measure your game.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>I am from China, I once coached a high school team. My players told me that it is too 
crowded with 10 players on the court, why can't they play with 8 players? 
That way they will get more chances to drive or cut just like the way they do in three on three. g.man</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>One great thing about basketball is you can vary the number of players and still play the game without 
much change. Our modern teams can be pretty big and certainly fill up a floor. For a youth coach, its 
important to teach spacing concepts to players so they can make use of the available space. The floor is a 
limited resource - use it wisely. I suppose you caould have a league that is only 4 on 4. However, that means 
fewer players can participate.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Is there a simple system, format, or template for substituting young players during a game?  
I used to have one that was based on rating your players and then depending on how many players 
you had (9,8,7 in my case) it gave a system for equal play.  I usually set my game plan ahead, 
but invariably, someone does not show up and it throws off my planning.  I coach young 4th grade 
boys.  Any suggestions?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I break the game down into 4 minute player chunks. For a typical 32 minute game, there are 40 of 
these chunks, and each of my ten players will get 4 of them. Usually, each player plays half a quarter. 
If somebody doesn't show, I have 4 
extra chunks to pass out, meaning there will be four of the nine players getting an extra shift of 4 minutes, or 
another way to express it, four players will now have one full quarter of play instead of just a half 
quarter. If two players don't show, I have extra 8 chunks to dole out, so each of the remaining eight 
players will have a full quarter at some point. I like to balance my units, so I usually have my 
combinations worked out before game time, including expected no shows. If I'm surprised by an absence, 
I improvise in granting the extra chunks.</p>

          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>What are some good post moves and some good drills for free throw shooting and some exercises or 
increasing vertical jump?</p>
          <h3>Answer</h3>
          <p>I teach the drop step and the power dribble for big guys. See the article &quot;Developing Your Big Player&quot;
 for details. The best way to practice free throws is when you're winded. Its hard work, but it pays 
 off when the stakes are high. A drill for jumping ... how many times can you jump from a standing 
 position and touch the back board in 30 seconds. Try it every day and see how much you improve!</p>
