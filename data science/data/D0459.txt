	 <H3>Summary of the Java Grande Forum</H3> 
	 <P>Java has potential to be a better environment for Grande application
		development than any previous languages such as Fortran and C++. The goal of
		the Java Grande Forum (JGF) is to develop community consensus and
		recommendations for either changes to Java or establishment of standards
		(frameworks) for Grande libraries and services. These language changes or
		frameworks are designed to realize the best ever Grande programming
		environment. The Java Grande Forum does not intend to be a standards body for
		the Java&#153; language per se. Rather, JGF intends to act in an advisory
		capacity to ensure those working on Grande applications have a unified voice to
		address Java language design and implementation issues and communicate this
		input directly to Sun or a prospective Java standards group. Java Grande Forum
		Process and Membership The forum conducts working meetings with a core group of
		active participants. These produce reports, which are reviewed in public forums
		and transmitted appropriately within the cognizant bodies within the Java and
		computational fields. The forum is open to any qualified member of academia,
		industry or government who is willing to play an active role. Please read the
		Java Grande Charter document for more information about becoming a member. The
		Forum was kicked off March 1,1998 at the third Java Grande conference held at
		Stanford University, Palo Alto. Our first major public meeting was held on
		November 13, 1998 as a 3-hour panel session at Supercomputing 98 in Orlando and
		a further meeting was held at SC 99 November 1999 in Portland, Oregon. The
		Forum has held numerous internal meetings and is updated at each Java Grande
		Conference. These are currently always held on the weekend before JavaOne in
		early June 1999, 2000 and 2001. The 2001 conference is a joint meeting with
		ISCOPE conference. The JGF is divided into two major areas: Numerics (Java on a
		single CPU and floating point issues) and Concurrency (Distributed and Parallel
		Java and Benchmarking)</P>
