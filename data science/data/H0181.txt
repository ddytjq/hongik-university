Along with this promise, concerns about the environmental and human health consequences of transgenic products in agriculture have been raised. The public debate has centered around the potential benefits and risks of the application of transgenic methods to agriculture, the oversight of the products, and their control and distribution. Specific issues depend on the product, its use, and its environment. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: Black">The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Life Sciences and Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources have convened a standing committee that will help identify emerging issues in the broad areas of agricultural biotechnology. The Standing Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology, Health, and the Environment (CABHE) will review and discuss scientific guidance for issues surrounding biotechnology as it is applied to food and fiber production, health, and the </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: Black">environment. The group will respond to important concerns in a timely fashion by helping to design projects focusing on specific issues. The standing committee will not author consensus studies, but will recommend NRC panels to do so and bring in outside expertise as needed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="BANR_transgenic_crops.html" target="_top">Environmental Impacts Associated with Commercialization of Transgenic Plants: Issues and Approaches to Monitoring and Assessment </a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt"> The standing Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology, Health, and the Environment convened the Subcommittee on Environmental Impacts Associated with Commercialization of Transgenic Plants to review the scientific basis that supports the determination of non-regulated status regarding transgenic crop products and to evaluate the scope and adequacy of the APHIS' review of environmental issues. In order to address these issues, a study will be conducted and will include: 1) a thorough review of the relevant scientific literature, APHIS documents and other sources of information regarding risks associated with crop plants in general, transgenic plants specifically, and the approaches to assessment and evaluation of those risks.  A particular focus within this section of the study will be the identification of effects of transgenic plants on non-target organisms and the environmental assessment of those effects. The study will also provide guidance on the assessment of non-target effects, appropriate tests for environmental evaluation, and assessment of cummulative effects on the environment. 2) an evaluation of the scientific premises underpinning the regulatory evaluation of genetic engineering, including a review of the assumptions inherent to genetic engineering. This review of the assumptions will evaluate and compare the  processes of genetic engineering with conventional plant breeding and development as they pertain to environmental risks.  3) an evaluation of the approaches to the verification process, the conclusions and the decisions, including recommendations for the types of monitoring that might be necessary after commercialization and the identification of unique safety concerns for products of biotechnology in relation to agriculture in general.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="Animal_biotechnology.html" target="_top">Defining Science-based Concerns Associated with the Products of Animal Biotechnology</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">    As the regulatory system for genetically modified animals and their products are discussed and evolves in the next several months, an opportune time exists for input defining the science-based risks and concerns that should be asked during the regulatory review of the food and environmental safety of animal biotechnology products. Therefore, the NRC&#8217;s Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology, Health, and the Environment will convene an ad hoc subcommittee to bring together a diverse set of experts to begin to identify these risks and prioritize them according to their relative importance and potential impact.  The objectives of this subcommittee are to: </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: Blue"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt">1) develop a consensus listing of concerns in the food safety, animal safety and environmental safety areas for various animal biotechnology product categories.  2) Provide criteria for selection of those concerns considered to be most important that need to be addressed or managed for the various product categories. 3) Identify and justify concerns that were considered but not identified as important for certain product categories.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="Animal%20Genomic%20Workshop.html" target="_top">Exploring Horizons for Domestic Animal Genomics</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: Black">. The goals of the workshop are to:1) provide a forum for exchange among the diverse communities of genomics and functional genomics experts, 2) elicit discussions of research directions in animal genomics that would benefit agriculture and society while leading to greater biological understanding, and 3) identify opportunities and obstacles that might be encountered in developing a coordinated, multi-organism functional and comparative genomics effort that would include domestic animals.  The workshop should also address the best science with implications for both human healthcare and the needs of industry and discuss the possibility for multi-stakeholder support of a domestic animal genomics initiative.  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="Exploring_Horizons_Workshop.html" target="_top">Click here to listen to the workshop</a></span></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt">NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT</span></i></b></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="BANR_Nonindigenous_Species.html" target="_top">The Scientific Basis for Predicting the Invasive Potential of Nonindigenous Plants and Plant Pests in the United States</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">   At the request of APHIS, the Board has convened a multidisciplinary committee of experts to investigate whether a scientific approach can be used to estimate the risk of the invasion and spread of introduced, non-native arthropods, pathogens and weeds that affect plants in the United States.

Many questions about our scientific knowledge and nationwide preparedness have been raised.  The National Academy of Sciences is convening a workshop to provide an opportunity for researchers, policymakers, health officials, and industry representatives to examine shared concerns and strategies to prevent the introduction and spread of animal diseases in the United States, as well as future needs for protection.  NAS seeks to create a forum where leading scientists and policymakers can discuss issues such as the potential for animal diseases to reach epidemic proportions, mechanisms in place to prevent and control these diseases in the immediate and long-term, and impacts of diseases on industries, populations, and international trade.  </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="Air%20Emissions%20from%20Animal%20Feeding%20Operations.html" target="_top">Air Emissions from Livestock Feeding Operations</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt"> This ad hoc committee of the standing Committee on Animal Nutrition will review and evaluate the scientific basis for estimating air emissions (including PM10, PM 2.5, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, odorous substances, VOCs, methane, and nitrous oxide) from animal feeding operations in the United States; relevant characteristics of agricultural animal industries that may affect emissions; and mitigation techniques and best management practices for reducing emissions.  The study will also evaluate the influence of animal life stages, weather patterns, and other biologic and physical factors on the variability of emissions from animal feeding operations.  It will consider approaches and information needed to evaluate local and long-range health and ecological effects of these emissions.  Finally, the study will identify critical research needs over the next five years for improving approaches for estimating emissions and potential emission mitigation techniques.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: Black"><b><u>Scientific Basis for Determining Human Health Effects of Genetically Engineered Food</u>  </b>The National Academies will convene a committee to outline science-based approaches to assessing (or predicting) unintended health effects of genetically engineered foods in order to assist in their evaluation prior to commercialization.  The committee will focus on 1) molecular mechanisms by which unintended changes in the biochemical composition of food from common domesticated crops occur as a result of various conventional and genetic engineering plant breeding and propagation methods, and the extent to which these mechanisms are likely to lead to significant compositional changes in foods that would not be readily apparent without new or enhanced detection methods, and 2) methods to detect such changes in food, as warranted, and to determine their potential human health effects.  It will consider appropriate scientific questions and methods for determining unintended changes in the levels of endogenous nutrients, toxicants, allergens, or other compounds in genetically engineered plants and in meat or milk from animals and outline methods to assess the potential short and long-term human consequences of such changes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: Black">The committee will compare genetically engineered foods to foods derived from other genetic modification methods (e.g. cross breeding) with respect to the frequency of compositional changes resulting from the modification process and the frequency and severity of the effects of these changes on consumer health.  As part of this comparison, the likelihood that elevated toxin or allergen levels would occur in domesticated animals or plants that are modified by different methods will be considered.  Based on this analysis, the committee will discuss whether certain safety issues are specific to genetically engineered foods, and if so, recommend approaches for addressing these issues. Also, the committee will separately evaluate potential unintended compositional changes and health effects of foods derived from cloned animals.  This evaluation will be presented in a short report separate from, but designed to accompany, the full-length report on foods derived from genetic modification methods.</span></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt">ANIMAL NUTRITION </span></i></b></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="BANR_CAN.html" target="_top">Committee on Animal Nutrition</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The sole standing committee of the Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources (BANR) is the Committee on Animal Nutrition (CAN).
