  <p> <b>Washington, DC </b> <b>(2/5/02)-</b> The parthenogenetic creation of 

    primate embryos with subsequent production of stem cells suggests a new, perhaps 

    somewhat less ethically controversial direction in research aimed at treating 

    human diseases with stem cell-derived therapies. Meanwhile, cloning and stem 

    cell research continue to develop at a dizzying pace. </p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parthenogenesis 

          is derived from the Greek words for 'virgin birth'. In modern biology, 

          it refers to a form of reproduction in which an ovum develops into a 

          new individual without having been fertilized. Many insect species are 

          known to reproduce by natural parthenogenesis. Examples include aphids, 

          bees and ants. In bees and ants, unfertilized eggs become drones. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As long ago as 1900, 

          biologists were able to encourage artificial parthenogenesis in some 

          species. Jacques Loeb reported in that year that he was able to induce 

          unfertilized frog eggs to grow by scratching them with a needle. Since 

          that time various chemical and mechanical means have been used to produce 

          artificial parthenogenesis in numerous animals including rabbits. However, 

          in most cases the resulting developments abnormal. </font></p>

          Greeks may have been mystified by many elements of molecular biology, 

          they would have easily been able to grasp parthenogenesis, a concept 

          rooted in their oldest myths.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Athena, daughter 

          of Zeus, was among the most important of the Greek deities. Her birth 

          was most unusual. Zeus swallowed his first wife Thetis when she became 

          pregnant, fearing a son would steal his throne. He developed a severe 

          headache and his fellow god Hephaestus was good enough to split his 

          head open with an ax. Athena emerged full grown, wearing a suit of armor, 

          from the head of Zeus. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Athena was the patron 

          goddess of Athens, and was associated with everything from warfare and 

          urban development to fertility and weaving. Her animal symbol the owl 

          gives rise to the still current association between owls and wisdom. 

          The Parthenon is the name of the temple of Athena on the Acropolis. 

          Other familiar words associated with Athena include the aegis (her shield) 

          and palladium (from Pallas Athena). NASA's &quot;<a href="http://www.athena.ivv.nasa.gov/index.htm" target="new">Project

  <p>A team of well-respected scientists from Mayo Clinic, Sloan Kettering Cancer 

    Center and Wake Forest University working with a Massachusetts biotechnology 

    company announced that they had managed to create primate embryos parthenogenetically, 

    that is, without fertilization. Moreover, they were able to tease stem cells 

    derived from the asexually derived embryos to produce numerous types of cells 

    including brain, heart and smooth muscle cells. </p>

  <p>One particularly promising development was the report that the researchers 

    were able to produce midbrain dopamine neurons, a first. The hope is that 

    some day such cells could replace dysfunctional cells in the brains of patients 

    with central nervous disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's 

    disease. </p>

  <p>Embryos are normally the product of sexual reproduction, when the male sperm 

    and female egg combine DNA. The current research involved stimulating a monkey 

    egg to grow without any help from sperm. The researchers used chemicals to 

    signal the eggs not to eject half of their chromosomes (as they would do in 

    sexual reproduction) and command the eggs to start dividing. In this case 

    the resulting mass of 100 or so cells, known as the blastocyst, cannot become 

    a viable organism when produced with the new technique. Four of 28 parthogenetic 

    eggs developed into blastocysts. The researchers were able to derive a single 

    stem cell line from one of the blastocysts. . </p>

  <p> "Neurons and other cells derived from this renewable source could alleviate 

    some of the technical problems of human cell therapy, including rejection 

    of transplanted tissue." said Jose Cibelli, Ph.D., chief scientist at Advanced 

    Cell Technologies. </p>

  <p>Stem cells are the holy grail of modern biology. These root cells can, with 

    proper stimulation, be used to produced virtually any type of cell in the 

    body. Until now, the best source of stem cells has been human embryos. These 

    have typically been obtained from fertility clinics. Considerable research 

    is also underway to clone stem cells derived from non-embryonic tissue. The 

    possibility of deriving stem cells from nonviable, asexually produced blastocysts 

    might solve, at least for some, the ethical debate currently raging on the 

    direction of therapeutic stem cell research.. </p>

  <p>&quot;This study suggests an alternative to human therapeutic cloning. Differentiated 

    cell types derived in vitro by parthenogenesis eliminate the requirement to 

    produce or disaggregate a normal, competent embryo and may circumvent the 

    ethical concerns voiced by some, positively impacting the debate in stem cell 

    research,&quot; the researchers noted in Science. </p>

  <p><b>Continuing Controversy</b></p>

  <p>How long will it be before human parthenogenesis is achieved? Researchers 

    from the same biotech company that supported the current research, Advanced 

    Cell Technologies, created considerable controversy in November of last year 

    when they announced they had cloned human embryos. The embryos had not grown 

    beyond six cells and had not produced stem cells. </p>

  <p>While the race is on to create parthenogenetic human embryos, considerable 

    doubts remain regarding the safety and efficacy of this approach. Researchers 

    believe that the male DNA that mixes with the females DNA in the egg probably 

    has an important role to play in gene activation in at least some kinds of 

    stem cells. For example, studies in mice produced parthenogenitically suggest 

    that those stem cells differentiate more readily into neurons than into other 

    cell types such a muscle. The hypothesis that such cells would indeed be immune-privileged 

    also remains unproven. </p>

  <p><b>Publish or ???</b></p>

  <p>There are also increasing concerns that the rush to be first is weakening 

    the safeguards provided by the traditional process of presenting data in peer-reviewed 

    journals. In some cases (e.g. Dolly the cloned sheep) potentially earthshaking 

    research findings are announced at press conferences rather than submitted 

    to scientific journals. This may be a good way to get the attention of the 

    venture capitalists (and stockholders) who support biotech startups, but does 

    not allow the review process that has become part of process of communicating 

    new scientific findings. Moreover, an initial publication in a journal has 

    traditionally been considered a starting point, with other researchers withholding 

    judgment until results can be reproduced independently.</p>

  <p><b>Stem Cells Grow Human Blood Vessels </b><br>

    <br>

    Efforts to derive stem cells from adult tissue are also progressing at a remarkable 

    rate. A report from the University of Minnesota Stem Cell Institute indicates 

    just how fast the field of therapeutic cloning is evolving. Researchers there 

    announced that they have managed to get a hitherto unknown type of adult bone 

    marrow stem cell to expand in the test tube into endothelial cells, and then 

    to get those cells to engraft in mice and contribute to new growth of blood 

    vessels. <br>

    <br>

    "These lab results demonstrate the potential of adult bone marrow stem cells 

    to differentiate beyond mesenchymal cells, into cells of the endothelium. 

    What we have seen is the ability of these cells to feed the blood vessels 

    of tumors and to heal the blood vessels surrounding wounds. The findings suggest 

    that these adult stem cells may be an ideal source of cells for clinical therapy. 

    For example, we can envision the use of these stem cells for therapies against 

    cancer tumors by, for instance, introducing anti-angiogenesis genes. Or, they 

    could be used to heal wounds such as ulcers or diabetic wounds or to treat 

    atherosclerosis," said Catherine Verfaillie, M.D., director of the University 

    of Minnesota Stem Cell Institute.<br>

    <br>

    The parthenogenetic monkey research appears in the February 1 issue of the 

    journal <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">Science</a></i>. The findings 

    of Dr. Verfaillie et al. appear the February 1, 2002 issue of <a href="http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/109/3/313"><i>Journal 

    of Clinical Investigation</i></a>. </p>
