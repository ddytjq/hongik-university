<h3>“No Grass is Growing Here”</h3>
<h4>R. P. Rennie,  Clinical Microbiologist</h4>

<p>Since the last Biologos, much has happened in The Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory. Alberta Health has continued the process of restructuring of the Provincial Laboratories under the direction of Cecilia Lord and Dr. Stephan Gabos.   
<p>A Management Advisory Committee for the laboratories has been struck and has held its first meeting. This Committee consists of important stakeholders for the Provincial Laboratories, including  Medical Officers of Health, Ministry representatives, Deans of the two medical schools, representatives of the major health authorities and of the diagnostic laboratory sectors.  The Provincial Laboratory directors are ex officio members of the Committee. 
<p>This Committee, chaired by Cecilia Lord, Assistant Deputy Minister, will provide advice to the laboratories on direction and policy.  A team Leader for the two public health laboratory sites will liaise with Alberta Health and with other laboratories in the province with respect to their relationship with the Provincial Laboratories. Alberta Health is in the process of recruiting to this position. 
<p>But enough about administrative matters! No grass is getting a chance to grow under The Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory. This has been a busy summer for outbreaks of infection all over the province. Nationally, a large outbreak of salmonellosis (S. enteritidis PT8) associated with processed cheese products produced in an Ontario manufacturing plant but shipped across the country provided considerable activity in the laboratory.  There were over 40 cases in Alberta, several hundred in Ontario. We have recently observed a marked increase in reports of E. coli 0157:H7 in Edmonton and surrounding areas. Fingerprinting of these isolates thus far shows several possible linked cases.
<p>Since May, there has been an ongoing battle with Shigella sonnei diarrhea outside the Edmonton region.  This outbreak has shown no signs of abating.  Public health officials  are incorporating intensive control efforts to try to curtail the outbreak.
<p>If that weren’t enough to keep us all busy, increased cases of ECHO virus type 30 have been identified from cerebrospinal fluid in the province. This appears to be following a trend that has been seen in Saskatchewan and in several central and northern states (e.g. Idaho, North Dakota, etc.) in the U.S.
<p>In the acute care arena, MRSA and VRE have reared their ugly heads in northern Alberta. VRE colonization in the renal dialysis population has presented a significant problem, but I think we can report that both the VRE and MRSA outbreaks have been brought under control by the combined excellent efforts of the laboratory and infection control practitioners.  Molecular diagnostics and typing has made a critical contribution to all of these outbreaks, and has become a growing area for the ability of our laboratory to act swiftly for diagnosis and surveillance of these outbreaks.
<p>The Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory is developing an important thrust for surveillance and detection of antibiotic resistance organisms. In partnership with the diagnostic laboratory sector, and utilizing our capabilities for molecular detection of resistance mechanisms, we will be working with Alberta Health to develop systems to monitor the development of antibiotic resistance in the province.  These resistant organisms present an enormous threat to our ability to effectively treat serious infectious diseases.  Without active and ongoing coordinated surveillance that threat will only increase.  Already, Alberta has the dubious distinction of the highest reported Canadian rates of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.  While we don’t fully understand the reasons for this problem, we know it was not present several years ago.  It is important to increase the awareness of this across the province.
<p>The Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory continues to be active in Research and Development.  
<ul>
<li>Development of a resource manual for water treatment plant operators related to operation and investigation of disease potential is in progress in collaboration with the American Waterworks Association Research Foundation (AWARF).  
<li>The National Centre for Streptococcus is continuing its role for surveillance of S. pneumoniae  provincially and nationally, and continues to be a leader in a collaborative project on invasive S. pneumoniae with CIDA and PAHO.  
<li>The National Centre for Mycology is involved in a number of investigations on development of methods for accurate detection of antifungal resistance.  
<li>The laboratory also is reestablishing itself internationally as a collaborative centre for diphtheria, and is repatriating strains that were long ago sent to the Public Health Service in England.  </ul>

<p>These efforts are all designed to provide continuing support for public health and acute care microbiology as we approach the millennium.  We will keep you posted as we continue to forge ahead in these many areas.
