The Code of Mortgage Lending Practice:
<p>
At the Universal we take customer service very seriously.  We subscribe to 
the Code of Banking Practice, and the Council of Mortgage Lenders' Code of 
Mortgage Lending Practice, which is a voluntary code dedicated to raising 
standards of mortgage advice.
<p>

Choosing a mortgage is probably one of the most important financial 
decisions that you can make, and at the Universal we believe we can help you 
make the right decision.  Under the Mortgage Code there are three levels of 
service to choose from:
<p>

<b>a.</b>      Advice and recommendation.  We will help you find a
mortgage that 
meets your individual needs and is most suitable for you, taking into 
consideration your individual requirements and market conditions.
<p>

<b>b.</b>      Information on the different types of mortgage products we
offer.  We 
will provide you with information on the different types of mortgages we 
offer, so that you can make an informed decision.
<p>

<b>c.</b>      Information on a single mortgage product only.  If you have
already 
made up your mind, we will provide you with the information on your 
chosen mortgage.
<p>

Applying for a mortgage via the internet, means that only levels b and c are 
available.  If you would like advice and recommendation on a mortgage that's 
right for you, please call us on 08000 28 83 83, and one of our mortgage 
advisors will be happy to help.
<p>

The Code also sets out certain information that we are required to provide to 
help you select the right mortgage
<p>

As a subscriber to the Mortgage Code, the Universal promises to adhere to 
the 10 key commitments.  By subscribing to the code the Universal will:
<p>
 
<li>       Act fairly and reasonably in all our dealings with you;
<p>

<li>       Ensure that all services and products comply with this Code,
even if they 
have their own terms and conditions;
<p>

<li>       Give you information on our services and products in plain
language, and 
offer help if there is any aspect which you do not understand;
<p>

<li>       Unless you have already decided on your mortgage, help you to
choose a 
mortgage to fit your needs; 
<p>

<li>       Help you to understand the financial implications of a
mortgage;
<p>

<li>       Help you to understand how your mortgage account works;
<p>

<li>       Ensure that the procedures our staff follow reflect the
commitments set out 
in this Code;
<p>

<li>       Correct errors and handle complaints speedily;
<p>

<li>       Consider cases of financial difficulty and mortgage arrears
sympathetically 
and positively;
<p>

<li>       Ensure that all services and products comply with relevant laws
and 
regulations.
<p>
