<blockquote><p<Edwin Hubble's discovery that the universe was expanding is to many the 
most significant scientific finding of the century.  Hubble's discovery 
stems from his careful and accurate measurements of distant galaxies 
light.  Application of a basic understanding of wave nature and the 
Doppler effect coupled with stellar spectroscopy techniques allow the 
basic physics student to explain the red-shift observed by Hubble as a 
consequence of an expanding universe.</p></blockquote>

<p><u>Part 1: LIGHT WAVES</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Light is best described as a wave.  All waves are characterized by a 
wavelength and a frequency.  

<p><center><img src="../images/wavelength.gif" border=0 alt="Wavelength" width=495 height=178></center></p>

<p>The wavelength describes the distance between the crest of each cycle. 
The frequency is the number of crests that pass any given point every 
second.  Visible light waves range in wavelength from approximately 400 
nanometers <br>(400 nm = 400 x 10<sup><font size=-2>-9</font></sup>m) for violet colors to about 700 nanometers for red.  Correspondingly, violet has a frequency of about 7.5 x 10<font size=-2><sup>14</sup></font> Hz (where 1 Hz is equal to 1 cycle/second) and red has a frequency of 4.3 x 10<font size=-2><sup>14</sup></font> Hz.

<p><center><img src="../images/spectrum.gif" border=0 alt="Visible Spectrum" width=500 height=202></center></p>


<p>Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation.  Other types of 
electromagnetic radiation like ultraviolet light, infrared light, radio 
waves and X-rays also travel in the form of a wave but at wavelengths to which our eyes are insensitive.

<p>Sound is not electromagnetic radiation, but sound is a wave as well. 
Higher pitches are caused by higher frequencies of vibrating molecules that
reach your eardrum.  Lower pitches are likewise caused by lower 
frequencies.

<p>Questions:<br>
<ol><li>What color has the longest wavelengths?</li>
<li>What color has the shortest wavelengths?</li>
<li>What color has more crests of its wave passing a given point in one 
second?  Explain.</li>
<li>Look up the prefixes "ultra" and "infra" in the dictionary.  Explain 
why the wavelengths just out of the visible spectrum are referred to as 
ultraviolet and infrared.</li></ol></blockquote>


<p><u>Part 2: DOPPLER EFFECT</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a wave source is moving, the crests of its waves get bunched together 
in front of the wave source.  If the wave crests are bunched together, 
their frequency increases.  In the case of a sound wave, the pitch is 
higher.  Behind the wave source, the waves spread out and the pitch 
is lower.</p>

<p><center><img src="../images/doppler.gif" border=0 alt="Dobbler Effect" width=500 height=188></center></p>



<p>In the case of light we use the terms "blue-shift" and "red-shift" to 
describe how the DOPPLER EFFECT changes the wavelength of the light. 
Being blue-shifted or red-shifted doesn't mean that the light necessarily 
becomes blue or red. It means simply that the light's wavelength either is shortened (blue shifted) because the object giving off the light 
is approaching, or is lengthened (red-shifted) because the object is moving away from the 
observer.</p></blockquote>


<p><u>Part 3: DETERMINING THE COMPOSITION OF STARS</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When energized atoms and molecules  vibrate, they give off massless 
light particles called photons.  These photons travel as a wave, 
but because of  quantum energy effects, a particular type of atom or 
molecule gives off only certain wavelengths of photon light.  For 
example, when hydrogen atoms are giving off energy in the form of light, 
they emit light specifically at wavelengths of 410.2 nm, 434.0 nm, 486.1 
nm, and 656.3 nm.  This is called the emission spectra of 
hydrogen.</p>

<p>Scientists can use the emission spectra of atoms and molecules to study 
the composition of stars.   Scientists need simply to look very carefully 
at the intensity and wavelengths of the light given off by the star.   A 
star containing hydrogen, for example, would have intense peaks of energy at 410.17 
nm, 434.05 nm, 486.13 nm, and 656.28 nm.  These hydrogen emission 
peaks would be in addition to the ones associated with the other 
elements contained in the star.</p></blockquote>

<p><u>Part 4: RECEDING STARS</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1920's, Edwin Hubble, while studying the stars of distant galaxies, found that for some, their emission spectra had peaks at 411.54 nm, 435.50 
nm, 487.75 nm, and 658.47 nm.  Hubble knew that these wavelengths did not 
correspond to any known element and that it was not likely that a combination of other 
elements or molecules was responsible.  He did notice that these 
spectral lines corresponded to hydrogen's emission spectra except that 
they were all 0.0033 percent longer in wavelength than they should have been 
for a hydrogen spectra.  Hubble deduced that this  red-shift  must be 
because of a Doppler effect.  His calculations showed that these galaxies 
must be moving away from earth at 1 x 10<sup><font size=-2>6</font></sup> m/s (one million meters per 
second)!</p></blockquote>

<p><u>Part 5: VERIFY HUBBLE'S WORK THAT SHOWS THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all waves, the product of wavelength and frequency gives the 
velocity of the wave where (lambda) is the wavelength and f is the frequency.</p>

<p><center>v = (lambda) f</center></p>

<p>In the case of light and other electromagnetic radiation, however, the 
velocity is always fixed at 3 x 10<sup><font size=-2>8</font></sup> m/s.  This speed of light  is assigned the variable c.</p>

	<p><center>	vlight = c = 3 x 10<sup><font size=-2>8</font></sup> m/s, or more precisely, c = 2.99792458 x 10<sup><font size=-2>8</font></sup> m/s</center></p>

<p>Use c = 2.9979 x 10<sup><font size=-2>8</font></sup> m/s for any calculations below.  Also, use the appropriate number of significant digits.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What would the frequency be of a violet light wave with wavelength 
of 410.17 nm?</li>

<li> What frequency is associated with 434.05 nm?</li>
<li> What frequency is associated with 486.13 nm?</li>
<li> What frequency is associated with 656.28 nm?</li>

<li> Imagine the hydrogen atoms in one of Hubble's distant stars emitting 
a photon of light at a wavelength of 410.17 nm.  If that particular 
photon were headed directly TOWARD Earth, how much CLOSER to us would 
that photon be after one second?  (Recall that the distance, d, that an object 
travels in a time, t is given by d = vt where v is the object's velocity.)</li>

<li> Now if the star that emitted the photon were traveling AWAY from 
Earth at 1 x 10<sup><font size=-2>6</font></sup> m/s, how much FARTHER from Earth would the star be after one second?</li>

<li> After one second, what is the distance between our initial photon and 
its star?</li>
<li> Our initial photon would be followed by many, many more just like it, 
each behaving similarly to the first.  After one second, how many wave 
cycles of photons would stretch between the distant star and our initial 
photon?</li>

<li> What is the average wavelength of this photon light?  (Hint: Use your 
answers from 4 and 5 above.)  Compare this with what Hubble saw.</li>




<li>Convince yourself of the validity of this process by repeating 
questions 2 through 6 for one more of the hydrogen emission spectra peaks 
at wavelengths 434.05 nm, 486.13 nm, or 656.28 nm. (Choose (a) the distance the photon travels toward Earth, 
(b) the distance the star moves away from Earth,  (c) the distance between the photon and the star,  (d) the number of cycles between the star and the photon, (e) the effective red-shifted wavelength.)</li>



<li>If you were driving in a VERY fast car, how would the things you 
approach look different from normal?  How would the things you drive 
away from look different?  Explain.</li>



<li>Why do you think Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding 
would have been impossible without instruments that could precisely 
measure emission spectra?</li></ol>
