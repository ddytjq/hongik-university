Getting Familiar with your JSP server</h2>
If you do not have a JSP capable web-server (sometimes known as <i>application
servers</i> for configuration reasons), the first step is to download one.&nbsp;
There are many such servers available, most of which can be downloaded
for free evaluation and/or development.&nbsp; Some of them are:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.blazix.com/blazix.html" target="_new">Blazix</a>
from Desiderata Software (<i>1.5 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs</i>)
<br><a href="http://www.unifyewave.com/servletexec/" target="_new">ServletExec</a>
from New Atlanta/Unify (<i>3.8 Megabytes, JSP and Servlets</i>)
<br><a href="http://www.jrun.com/" target="_new">JRun</a> from Allaire
(<i>11 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs</i>)
<br><a href="http://www.beasys.com/" target="_new">WebLogic</a> from BEA
Systems (<i>44 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs</i>)
<br><a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/" target="_new">WebSphere</a>
from IBM (<i>105 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs</i>)</blockquote>
If you do not already have a server, it is recommended that you download
<a href="http://www.blazix.com/blazix.html" target="_new">Blazix</a>
because it includes a tag library that is used later in this tutorial in
the tag library chapter.&nbsp; Blazix is also very small and can be easily
downloaded even over a modem, will work on all kinds of systems including
Windows 98, and can be installed in less than ten minutes.
<p>To truly learn JSP, it is really very important that you try out the
examples with a real server.&nbsp;&nbsp; This web-site doesn't have running
examples because running examples really don't do a good teaching job.&nbsp;
The best way to learn the technology is to get hands-on experience.&nbsp;
If you don't have a server, please go get one and install it now!
<p>Once you have a web-server, you need to know the following information
about your web-server:
<ul>
<li>
Where to place the files</li>

<li>
How to access the files from your browser (with an <tt>http:</tt> prefix,
not as <tt>file:</tt>)</li>
</ul>
You should be able to create a simple file, such as
<blockquote>
<pre><tt>&lt;HTML>
&lt;BODY>
Hello, world
&lt;/BODY>
&lt;/HTML></tt></pre>
</blockquote>
know where to place this file and how to see it in your browser with an
<tt>http://</tt>
prefix.
<p>Since this step is different for each web-server, you would need to
see the web-server documentation to find out how this is done.&nbsp; Once
you have completed this step, proceed to the next tutorial.
