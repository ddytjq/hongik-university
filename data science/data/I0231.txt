    relocate in Dublin, Wimbledon FC have turned their attention to Belfast, either under

    of State Mo Mowlam and is to be financed by a group of as yet anonymous local businessmen.
    It is claimed that the plan would benefit Northern Ireland both economically and socially.
    <p>However, very few people seem to be considering what effect the move would have on the
    local Irish League scene. The Irish Football Association and the Irish League are united
    in their opposition to the plan, and they have the support of the world governing body,
    FIFA, in this. </p>
    <p>A recent Belfast Telegraph poll was decided 65% in favour of the move although the
    Northern Ireland Football Supporters Association responded to the vote with arguments
    against Wimbledon (or any other club) coming to 'our wee country'. </p>
    <p>The proposal is gaining an ever increasing amount of coverage in the local media and in
    the interests of fairness these have been reproduced for your perusal. I would encourage
    you to read these articles bearing in mind the effect that an English Premiership club
    playing out of Belfast would have on the Irish League and your local club.</p>

    <p>The Northern Ireland Football Supporters Association (N.I.F.S.A) wishes to publicly
    state it's opposition to the relocation or basing of an English Premiership club in
    Belfast. We support the IFA and the Irish League in their efforts to prevent this from
    becoming a reality and we offer whatever help and assistance we can.</p>
    <p>However, there are several points, which we feel, are being overlooked in the current
    debate...</p>
    <p>We believe in the fundamental right of Wimbledon supporters (or whoever) to watch and
    support their team in their own area. Any move is akin to one of our clubs moving to the
    mainland. It is unfair and unjust to expect these supporters to make the journey across
    the Irish Sea once a fortnight. </p>
    <p>Who will watch this 'new' club? The big selling point behind the proposal is the
    prospect of Premiership football in Belfast. Certainly, the new stadium will be filled to
    capacity for those games against the bigger clubs but what sort of attendance will a match
    against some of the so-called 'lesser' teams attract? It is doubtful if it will be in
    excess of the crowds Wimbledon currently record. </p>
    <p>The Irish League has survived remarkably well over the past 30 years in very trying
    circumstances. Although the local scene does not possess the glamour of the English or
    Scottish versions that is not to say it is any less exciting or entertaining. We appeal to
    the members of the public who support the idea to give the Irish League a try. It would be
    a tragedy if the future of the league were to be put at risk because of the prospect of
    Manchester United or Liverpool visiting Belfast for a competitive match once a season. </p>
    <p>We are not ignorant of the fact that the Irish League has many problems. We have, on
    numerous occasions, publicly called for a summit to be held to debate and find solutions
    to those problems. We repeat that call. WE APPEAL</p>
    <p>TO THE AUTHORITIES TO MEET SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. Everyone has to be involved in
    this, from the men at the top right down to the ordinary supporter - football's biggest
    sponsor after all. </p>
    <p>The prospect of a national stadium is to be applauded. Northern Ireland currently lags
    behind the rest of Europe in this respect and any proposal to provide first class sporting
    facilities for our province has to be welcomed.</p>
    <p>We have long supported the idea of a national stadium in which fans of all sections of
    our community can feel comfortable and safe watching Northern Ireland.</p>
