<CENTER>PREFACE</CENTER>
<BR WP="BR2">
<P>"All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event--in the living act, the
undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its
features from behind the unreasoning mask."  </P>

<P>								Captain Ahab</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Mask of the Universe</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Though not a social creature, I attended a few parties with fellow graduate students and faculty
at the University of California, San Diego.  I recall a  non-academic young lady at one of the parties
approached me and asked  what I did.</P>

<P>"I am a cosmologist," I replied with some pomp, proud that I had initiated a journey of great
peril and scope.</P>

<P>"Great!" she said, "could you do my face sometime?"</P>

<P>Had I been in full possession of my faculties, I might have replied:</P>

<P>"I don't make up faces, I make up the Universe!"</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The face the universe presents taunts us. As the white whale, 'Moby Dick', taunted Ahab and
his crew, the facts we gather about the large scale structure and evolution of the universe have led
us to one disappointing plateau of false understanding to another. From the comfort of Einstein's
Static Homogeneous Universe, we moved to an expanding one as the data demanded. Hoyle and
Bondi imitated sameness over space with sameness over time:  their Steady State theory of
continuous creation.  It went down with observations that the universe had indeed evolved. We then
confronted the non-Newtonian behavior of galaxies and galactic clusters and proposed it to be
explained by matter which does not shine--dark matter. This seemed to be corroborated by Guth's
Inflationary Theory of a short-lived accelerated expansion which required the universe to have more
matter than we see. </P>

<P>Now it seems this type of acceleration is not short-lived. Data from ancient exploding stars--supernovae--reveal a force of cosmic repulsion. This is not what most cosmologists expected. We
have encountered the white whale and it has sunk our 'Pequod', the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century cosmological ship
of thought.</P>

<P>In this book we chronicle the journey of this 'Pequod'.  In a way, the characters in this story are
not so much individuals like Einstein, Lemaitre, Hoyle, Bondi, and Guth.  Rather, they are the
different personalities which live in the psyche of a cosmologist--and perhaps each one of us.</P>

<P>There is 'Captain Ahab', the compulsive self which inordinately longs to solve the mystery of
the origin and evolution of the cosmos.  The dedicated cosmologist strives to wrest the mystery
'from the hands of God' with a vigor which can become obsessive. I gave up a spiritual vocation to
go on my personal cosmological quest.</P>

<P>There is 'Queequeg', the savage mystical part, which longs to intuit the true nature of the
cosmos by directly experiencing its relationship to the inner cosmos of a man or woman. Drugs, near
death experiences, fasting, contemplation of omens (all used by Melville's South Sea island
harpooner), all are products of the desire of the soul to reunite with its source. As in my case,
cosmologists may take up their 'calling'  in response to a mystical, or at least transforming
experience.</P>

<P>Certainly, all scientists can recognize 'Starbuck' in themselves--the voice of responsibility and
reason: conservative, careful science.  He tempers the 'Ahab' in us by reminding us our models must
tow in to the observational data. Otherwise we will be abandoning our reason and perhaps our
'living' and our families.  Being a theorist, I have often gone on flights of mathematical fancy,
ignoring the voice of the 'Starbuck' in me.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>My own story begins much as Ishmael's in 'Moby Dick'. A schoolteacher, going back to
graduate school, saunters into 'port'. The goal is to "sail about a little and see the watery part of the
world." In my case, this was a journey into the sea of space, the domain of astronomy and
astrophysics, rather than whaling and charting.</P>

<P>In telling this tale, I will relate it to the order of events and appearances of characters in
Melville's story. Chapters and subheadings will be headed by major characters or events in 'Moby
Dick' and their similarity to cosmologists' or my own personality and the events which shaped them.</P>

<P>If the metaphors and similes become strained, forgive me. Hopefully the drama and adventure
of the quest for the 'White Whale' will compensate the reader. Perhaps we both might understand
a little better the "little lower layer" of the mask, the "makeup" of the universe.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION--Ismael and Queequeg: The Student and the Mystic</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    Carl Jung, the great psychologist, spoke of the archetypes and their complexes which reside
below the surface of the conscious mind. Like sea creatures, they surface from time to time
controlling events and shaping our lives.  Recently rereading Herman Melville's <U>Moby Dick</U>, I was
impressed that his characters were part of me in a strange way, descriptive forces in the unfoldment
one of my greatest passions in life: cosmology.</P>

<P>    I also realized that one could say, in Jungian fashion, and in imitation of the ancient sage
Hermes: 'as within, so without'. This means that everyone I meet or read about in my quest are
embodiments of a certain 'personality' within me. In many cases, more than one person outpictures
one archetype. For example, in this book I characterize Einstein, Peebles, and myself at times as
'Ahab' in our relentless pursuit of the concept of cosmic repulsion (what I call the 'white whale' of
cosmology).</P>

<P>    For Jung, to understand one's archetypes is to begin to understand oneself, however
contradictory these inner persons may appear. Thus this book has a dual purpose: to explain modern
cosmology for the layperson, and to understand myself better. If in the process you see reflected
your own inner 'persons' and comprehend the beauty and unity of the universe, this is an added
bonus.</P>

<P>    Jung and the physicist Wolfgang Pauli wrote about a phenomenon called 'synchronicity'. Our
inner worlds and dreams are often synchronized with outer world events in an unexplainable
coincidence. For this reason, when in the latter part of February 1998, it was announced that
observations of ancient supernovae confirm that the universe is expanding ever more rapidly with
time, I was on the alert for other major related events. The announcement of a TV miniseries, 'Moby
Dick', proved to be a goldmine of coincidence. The metaphor of whaling for cosmology proved
irresistible.  It was shortly after viewing the film that I conceived the theme of this book.</P>

<P>    </P>

<P>"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and
see the watery part of the world"</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A Schoolteacher arrives in port: off to see the 'ocean' of astronomy</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    It was 1978. I had been a guitar teacher on and off for about 7 or maybe 8 years, when I
moved from New York City to Pasadena California to become active in the affairs of my church.
To support myself, I worked as a room service waiter, and earned a meager income. It was only
necessary for me to work short hours, so I spent the rest of my time reading, visiting the Cal Tech
library and bookstore, and formulating ideas as to how the universe had come about. I reveled in the
idea that I was actually walking in Einstein's footsteps. I filled several notebooks with calculations
and cosmological ideas. I was becoming enamored with the 'sea of astronomy'.  </P>

<P>    This was a sudden romance, since I had long ago abandoned physics in graduate school in
the late '60's, and hadn't studied it for about 10 years, during which I devoted my energy to a musical
career and the practice of yoga. </P>

<P>    At the same time spiritual impulses led me to join the staff of my church, which engaged me
in a very monastic life of service.  I held a position, among other things, as a science teacher in a
Montessori school.  This lasted three years, and though I felt my spiritual horizons widen, my
fascination with the 'sea' bothered me, and I sought time to further my interest. Finally I left the
safety of the church staff, and took off to the University of California at San Diego to enroll in
graduate school again and study Cosmology. This was all happening at the ripe age of 40.  Ishmael
had finally headed out to sea.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Queequeeg: drugs, mysticism, and near death experiences</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    A major role in my decision to pursue cosmology was the Queequeg who had surfaced at
various times in my life. The spiritual, the mystical, almost primitive urge to know the meaning of
life, led me to the ultimate question: 'where did the universe come from?'     </P>

<P>   My acquaintance with my 'Queequeg' began in 1964. I had just graduated from the University
of California at Riverside and was bound to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia with a
fellowship in physics. I was interested in time and wanted to study particle physics and time reversal
'invariance'. </P>

<P>     However, I met a friend about a year before who was different from anyone I'd met.  He
always wore black, and taunted me with descriptions of his experiences.  Sitting in an outdoor caf&eacute;,
he would point out that he could see the quantum waves of which he thought trees were made.
Though I was learning that quantum waves of large objects like trees were not 'visible', I was fascinated that
he somehow related his drug experiences to physics. We became friends, fellow guitar pickers, and
roommates in spite of the fact that he never washed his clothing or his sheets--they were black with
grime. </P>

<P>    The day after graduation he talked me into taking LSD.  I remember going to a new
apartment empty of furniture where we met a strange white but oriental-looking young man playing
with straws. He called it 'casting the I-Ching'.  He was to be our guide. Though his  Zen-like lack of
response to my questions and bizarre behavior scared me to death, I was determined to go through
with it, because I felt I had much to experience within myself. </P>

<P>     During the experience, I saw my life pass in front of my eyes, the sun rolling round
thousands of times through the sky.  Time rolled back to the caveman era, and I saw students
walking around without clothes, suddenly growing beards.  Time was disjoint in other ways.</P>

<P>I saw a glass of water I had drunk refill with no source, and I was convinced that my quest  to
understand the physics of time was futile.  If time were really relative to the observer and  as
meaningless as I had experienced, why study it?  I lost my faith in science.  It could not explain my
hallucinogenic experiences.</P>

<P>  In about two years I dropped drugs forever when my wife was held in a Laredo jail for carrying
some marijuana given to us as a wedding gift across the border. She did not know that a friend riding with 
us had placed it in her purse.

<P>     Though I went on to graduate school with a fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania , 
my bout with drugs made me lazy. I hoped to get by without working, and after three years of 
just squeezing by I dropped out.  I earned my way teaching folk guitar to beginners and later 
more advanced students.  I wrote songs and had a songwriting contract for a time with Don
MacClean's (Bye Bye Miss American Pie) agent.  However, no one was buying my songs, though
I wrote hundreds, and I wasn't totally obsessed with music. I practiced very little, almost cut an
album as 'Petersen and Patterson'.  Our album cover with Vanguard was to picture us in the rain. 
The title was to be 'Peter Patter'. It just was not to be.  Though they liked our tape, some executive
up the line aced the project.  I also played lead guitar behind Janis Ian's number one single, 'At
Seventeen', but Columbia Studios didn't like my folky part as much as a jazz version they had
recorded.</P>

<P>     Soon I was to have my second near-death experience.</P>

<P>   My first had happened after my sophomore year in college.  I was laid up in the University
infirmary with what they called 'echo fever'.  My temperature went up and down in big cycles. At
one point it was 108 (I thought I was supposed to be dead by then).  They packed me in ice, and I
had an out of body experience, during which I promised to become a minister of the gospel if I lived. 
I later regretted the thought and never did live up to the promise, except for lecturing for my church
for about a year.</P>

<P>   The second near death experience was more relevant to cosmology. I was taken with flu-like
symptoms, and vowed to meditate until they went away. I held a picture of Christ of the Andes in
my mind, and felt he was instructing me in a breathing technique I later found to be identical to
Kriya Yoga (a secret form only known by initiated followers of Yogananda).</P>

<P>   As I meditated a column of intense white light began to rise up my spine.  As it hit each nerve
center along the spinal column, I had new revelations of the nature of the universe. When it reached
my heart, I realized my oneness with the universe.  As it rose to my throat, the universe condensed
into billions of points of light. (I had a good laugh when President George Bush later talked about
people the same way.)  At the third eye all the many points unified into one radiating point
containing all of consciousness--so this was the 'one God'?</P>

<P>I lost consciousness.  I expressed concern about dying to Marilyn, my wife at the time.  She
reassured me I wasn't going to die, and it happened--I was absorbed into mystical unity--sammadhi,
as the yogis call it. </P>

<P>   This all was a 'Christian' experience, inspired by meditating on Jesus with outstretched arms.
Everywhere I went I saw statues that reminded me of my glimpse of God and how space was filled with
the fire of unified consciousness.  At times I wondered whether that fire was what made the universe
expand.  Only recently has that possibility opened up again for cosmologists.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter 1  <STRONG>Captain Ahab--Cosmology With A Vengeance</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"Already we are boldly launched upon the deep, but soon we shall be lost in its unshored,
harbourless immensities."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Open Sea--An Infinite Universe?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>  We head out to sea, the Pequod, our ship of Cosmology, full of sailors--parts of ourselves who
relate to the adventure ahead. What is the nature of the sea of space? The world was once thought
to be flat, and sailors feared falling off the edge of a finite plane. Colombus had discovered once
again that the world was spherical before Melville wrote 'Moby Dick'. </P>

<P>   The spherical nature of the planet was understood by Pythagoras nearly 2,400 years earlier.
Though we don't know if he was the first to have this knowledge, we do know that he noticed ships
appear to sink as they went out to sea, and the circular nature of the earth's shadow in a lunar
eclipse. These facts led him to conclude the earth was 'round'.</P>

<P>     What of space? Pythagoras thought of the stars as embedded on a celestial sphere. After all,
didn't they have circular tracks in the sky at night?  Simplicity would demand that the stars occupy
a surface  reflective of the earth itself: a sphere. That meant that all objects in the heavens were less
than that distance away. The planets--Greek for 'wandering stars'--turned on imaginary spheres
inside the sphere of the fiery element of the stars. Aristotle, two generations down the line, carried
on and expanded this earth-centered, finite universe picture. </P>

<P>    Even Copernicus, who in 1543 AD 'changed the world forever' with his picture of planets
revolving around the sun, still had the stars pasted on a finite sphere. Though he increased their
distance so as to conform with observational facts, his universe was still finite.</P>

<P>   Aristarchus in the second century BC first suggested a sun-centered universe, infinite in
extent. However, observations seemed to contradict his great intuitive glimpse. Aristotle, two
centuries before him, pointed out that if the sun were at the center of the universe, the angular
location of the stars would change with the seasons as the earth orbited the sun. This 'stellar parallax'
was not observed,  so when Aristarchus asserted the universe to be heliocentric, reasonable scientists
dismissed it. The problem was with Aristotle's small distance to the stellar sphere. If stars were
much further away, they would shift by too small an amount to be seen as the earth shifted its
position.</P>

<P>    The universe seemed 'made for man' instead of the modern idea of man evolving from the
universe.  This stigma still clung to the picture of Copernicus. Fifty years after Copernicus passed,
the infinite universe was again proclaimed. The monk, Giordano Bruno gave us a vast, untrammeled
view:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"The stars are suns like our own and there are countless suns freely suspended in limitless
space, all of them surrounded by planets like our own earth, peopled with living beings.  The sun
is only one star among many, singled out because it is so close to us. The sun has no central position
in the boundless infinite."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Such a profound, revolutionary set of hypotheses has no comparison in the history of science.
In 1997, we found evidence of the first planets around other stars. In 1998, we saw one directly.
Bruno spoke that hypothesis 400 years before it was proven. Though many believe UFO's are
evidence of extraterrestrial life, the hypothesis of 'living beings' still remains to be openly verified.
In addition,  cosmologists are still contending over whether the universe is finite or infinite.
However, the results of early 1998 dealing with supernova expansion seem to favor the latter.   </P>

<P>   Bruno was burned at the stake as a heretic.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Isaac Newton, with Ahabian abandon, also supported the 'infinite universe' theory.  </P>

<P>  Newton was attending Cambridge University, when a version of the plague swept the
countryside. His school was shut down, but this didn't deter his studies. He retreated to his mother's
care at Woolsthorpe, and discovered the laws of motion, but more important to our discussion is his
discovery of the nature of gravity.</P>

<P>   I often ask my students what they would do if an epidemic of the proportion of the plague
were to shut down all colleges. It could be AIDS, ebola virus, or something else. Would they have
the initiative to follow their search for knowledge anyway? Would their dream just languish, or
perish?</P>

<P>   Newton's contribution to the understanding of gravity was penultimately profound. His
famous second law of motion was really the definition of mass, the source of gravity. No one before
him had quantified matter, made it amenable to experiment. He defined mass as the ratio of the total
applied force on an object to it's acceleration.</P>

<P>    Second, Newton realized that gravity acted from the center of a symmetric spherical object
like the earth. It generated an attractive pull he deduced from Kepler's laws of planetary motion, to
be proportional to the masses of the two objects involved. Gravity was found to be a very weak
force.  It takes the entire earth to produce a pull on your body with a force equal to your weight.</P>

<P>    There is another way of demonstrating how weak gravity is. Take a blown-up balloon and
hold it against the wall. Newton said that wall should attract the balloon in proportion to its mass
and that of the wall. This is the 'Universal' of the 'Universal Law of Gravitation'--all bodies attract
this way.</P>

<P>However, the gravity of the earth overpowers that attraction and the balloon falls to the floor.
If, however, you charge the balloon by rubbing it against your clothing, it will stick to the wall by
inducing an opposite charge in it.  That is, with a little bit of charge in the balloon and wall,
electricity has exerted a force much stronger than the gravity between the balloon and wall. Thus
gravity is weaker than the electric force.</P>

<P>    The third thing Newton realized, again by deriving it from Kepler's laws, was that gravity
falls off as square of the distance between centers of symmetric spherical objects. This r-squared
law of  diminution holds, strangely enough, for light intensity from a spherical source, and for
electrical force as well.  It is as if gravity is an emanation like light--a field, if you will. The fall-off
was discovered around the same time by an English contemporary of Newton's: Robert Hooke.
Newton and Hooke had a bitter dispute about the discovery of gravity. However, Newton won out,
as Hooke had only discovered that one fact about gravity, whereas Newton had attained more
profound knowledge.</P>

<P>    Newton used his grasp of gravity to reason that the universe must be infinite. He assumed
stars to be distributed somewhat uniformly throughout space. Each star attracted each other by
gravity. If such a universe were finite, the stars would fall together, attracted by the force. This could
be stopped by assuming an infinite universe, since each star would have equal pull to all sides.
Milne and McCrea in the 1930's discovered that Newton's laws of motion and gravity could be used
to describe the universe, giving the same results as the more profound General Theory of Relativity
of Einstein. Only when observing very distant objects must we use Einstein's theory.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">How Ahab Lost His Leg--Einstein's Greatest Blunder</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    It was this static, infinite 'Ahabian'  universe to which Einstein and most physicists clung
before the era of the First World War. This was shortly before Edwin Hubble and his assistant
Milton Humason discovered the galaxies were flying apart. After all, when we look at the sky, the
stars appear to hang there motionless except for the motion due to the earth's turning under them.
Also, observations on the new 100 inch Mount Wilson telescope indicated a universe orders of
magnitude more vast than previous instruments. For all intents and purposes, it seemed as if it would
all go on forever.</P>

<P>    Having just formulated his new theory of gravity, General Relativity, in 1915, a static
universe was puzzling to Einstein. In this theory of gravity it was possible for the universe to be
finite. If the matter in it were dense enough, space and time would bend in response--into a closed
form. This is analogous to the surface of a sphere, but in an extra dimension. In this 'spherical'
closed finite universe,  gravity would  collapse it.  Being static like in Newton's example, there
would be nothing to prevent the force from drawing all the stars together. However, we don't see
this, Einstein surmised. </P>

<P>   He concluded that gravity must be countered by a repulsive force. He also included this as
an addendum to his General Theory of Relativity. There are many ways of thinking of this force, but
perhaps the most graphic is to compare space to a compressed sponge when you let it expand. An
ideal gas has a similar outward pressure.  It is sort of like having compressed springs between the
galaxies. In fact, our friend Hooke would have been pleased to find that the force necessary is
proportional to the expansion scale as in his famous 'Hooke's Law' of spring extension. However,
instead of being attractive, like for a spring, it is repulsive. As for a spring, the force is imputed a
strength by a constant.  This universal 'spring' constant is lambda (&Lambda;), the 'cosmological constant'. </P>

<P>    There are very convincing mathematical reasons why the force must be represented by a
lambda term in Einstein's Field Equations, but for many years, scientists thought there were
observational and theoretical reasons that force should be zero (&Lambda; = 0). We will discuss that later
in the book. </P>

<P>    When the expanding universe was discovered, the need for a force to balance gravity was
done away with. Einstein began to think of the cosmological constant as his 'Greatest Blunder'.
'Ahab' lost his leg in the first encounter with the 'white whale'. </P>

<P>     It  was thought that the universe would slow down as it expanded, much like a ball slows
down when thrown straight up from the earth.  It was believed that gravity was the only force acting
on the galaxies and tended to decelerate them. A term was devised as a measure for the amount of
deceleration. Thus was born what cosmologists call the 'deceleration parameter', q . We will later
see, however, that observations of the rate of supernova expansion do not behave like a decelerating
ball. Rather we must hypothesize a force similar to Einstein's to explain the universal <U>ac</U>celeration,
and q must be a negative number at present.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Maps: Is the Universe Closed or Open?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    Ahab consulted detailed maps and was familiar with the lay of the oceans. Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity gives us possible maps of the universe. It says that the gravitational nature of
matter is equivalent to curved space-time. The more matter is in space-time the more curved it is.
Generally in cosmology we assume that the matter density at the largest scale is uniform throughout
space. Later we will see just how uniform it really is. But for now, consider adding matter uniformly
a little at a time to originally flat space-time. The more we add the more curved it is. </P>

<P>    <EM>Note that we are leaving out any additional components, like the cosmological constant,
contributing to the curvature of space. Though we now know that this is probably not valid, such
a discussion is at least simple, and will give us ideas which will be useful later.  All we have to do
is consider the density of the sum of the components, including mass, and the description will be
otherwise identical.</EM></P>

<P>   The addition a mass increasing the curvature is analogous to trying to bend a thin rod of steel
by applying increasing force on two ends. Such a tensile force will be uniformly distributed. The
more pressure (gravity due to mass), the more the rod will bend. A critical amount of pressure
(mass) is reached where the steel bends into a circle.</P>

<P>   In a similar way, if a critical mass density is exceeded for models of the universe in Einstein's
theory, space-time is bent into a hyper-sphere. This is one dimension up from the surface of a sphere 
like the earth in shape, and the universe is finite in extent, a finite hyper-spherical surface. We call
this a 'closed universe'.  Friedmann, who did the first General Relativity for the expanding universe,
did some calculations.  His equations implied that the universe, if only the force of gravity were
important, would expand for a time, then recollapse into what we now call 'the Big Crunch'. </P>

<P>   If the present mass density is less than the critical amount, space-time is saddle-shaped and
infinite, sort of like an extended 'Pringle' potato chip. This is called an 'open universe'. Friedmann's
mathematics (without cosmological constant) said that this type of universe would expand forever. 
</P>

<P>   The expansion in these models can be grasped if we think of throwing a ball off successively
larger asteroids. If your arm can achieve acceleration to a certain velocity, you could throw the ball
at that speed straight up in all cases. Newton laws tell us that escape velocity from a gravitational
body goes up as the mass goes up.  </P>

<P>  The gravity of a small asteroid is insufficient to prevent the ball from escaping. In a nearly
empty universe, expansion will slow in rate and eventually continue outward at a nearly constant
velocity. In fact, this is true for a universe with any density less than the critical amount. </P>

<P>    When we try the asteroid with just enough gravity to barely turn the ball around, this is like
critical mass density for the universe. All larger asteroids return the ball because escape velocity
exceeds the velocity thrown. Thus a universe with enough density doesn't originally have escape
velocity from itself, and recollapses.</P>

<P>    However, what if gravity is not the only force important to changes in expansion? Then the
entire  picture must be modified. LeMaitre, the Catholic priest, did calculations in the early 1930s
for a repulsive force added to gravity, and found the behavior to be more complex. We will talk
about these possibilities later, in our next encounter with the 'white whale' of cosmology.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    As we look out at the expanse of stars, the band of stars we call the Milky Way takes on the
character of an imaginatively semi-uniform veil. Thus it was that early cosmologists assumed the
universe to be uniformly sprinkled with matter at the largest scale. Perhaps the assumption was also
inspired by the fact that calculations for a non-uniform universe were outrageously difficult in
Einstein's General Theory. Though knowing that proof of such a sweeping generalization was not
attainable with the telescopes of the 20's and 30's, Robertson and Walker obtained in this epoch a
description of the curvature of a universe which was not only looked the same everywhere, but the
same in any direction. They called it 'homogeneous and isotropic'.</P>

<P>    A homogenous universe is invariant under translation from one position in space to another.
The density in one locality is identical to that in another locality. How can this be if the universe
contains lumps like stars, galaxies, galactic clusters, galactic superclusters, and perhaps complexes
of superclusters?  Evidence now indicates that  beyond the scale of superclusters this is nearly true. 
Although the universe has not been thoroughly mapped, the overall picture in our locality is that the
universe is smooth at the very largest scale. 'Largest scale' is like looking at the lights of Los Angeles
at night from a large distance. They all blend into a smooth glow</P>

<P>    There is at least one exception called the Great Attractor, a mass at least a thousand times
larger than that of the largest galaxy observed.  Hidden by the dust in our galaxy, behind its center,
this large gravity source is drawing thousands of galaxies toward it in 'violation' of the expanding
universe. However, even the Great Attractor pales to insignificance as a lump, if the scale imagined
is large enough. This is particularly so if the universe is Open and infinite, as we now suspect.</P>

<P>    The universe is also isotropic, invariant under rotations. The density we observe at a given
distance is the same no matter what direction we look. Maps of the universe at the largest scale look
the same wherever we turn.</P>

<P>   Thus these two assumptions, very much ad hoc at first, have now become fairly firmly
founded in observations. They are as rational as Starbuck's goal to hunt whales without risking the
unknown in an encounter with the leviathon, Moby Dick. And, as with Starbuck, one's livelihood
as a cosmologist may be dependent on these realizable conditions. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Origin of the Ocean: the Big Bang</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The discovery of the expanding universe began with Vesto Slipher's measurements of what
we call the 'redshifts; of galaxies in 1914. Working at Lowell Observatory in Arizona, he noticed
the Doppler shifting of spectral lines in 11 out of 15 galaxies was toward the red end of the rainbow,
indicating that they were moving away from us. This motion indicated that what was thought to be
gas clouds called 'nebula' in some cases were not caught up in the motion of the galaxy.  Curtis used
this fact to try to convince the scientific world that this 'island universe' of the Milky Way was not
the only one--that there were other galaxies of stars besides our own.  His debate on this issue with
Harlow Shapley, who first proved we don't inhabit the center of the universe, was inconclusive,
however.</P>

<P>	Obtaining spectra of galaxies at that time was an all night, time-exposure affair, so the
sample was limited. This small sample was by no means proof that the universe was expanding.
Four out of the 15 galaxies had blueshifts, indicating motion towards the observer.</P>

<P>	Edwin Hubble, a law student turned astronomer, was the first to have opportunity to take a
larger sample on the Mt. Wilson observatory scope. The actual all night vigils were accomplished
by his assistant, Milton Humason. This is sort of like having a crew member up in the crows nest
searching for spouting whales. </P>

<P>	Humason was a mule team driver who carted the telescope parts up the narrow mountain
roads to Mt. Wilson.  He had only elementary school education, and was an addicted gambler who
was hired on as a janitor in the observatory.  His curiosity led Hubble to teach him how to operate
the telescope and photographic equipment.</P>

<P>	They noticed a trend in the spectra of the more distant of their sample.  A little over thirty
galaxies seemed to lie along a line in a plot of Doppler shift-implied recession velocity versus
distance. The Doppler shift in frequency can be experienced when a fire engine races away from us. 
The greater its speed, the greater the shift. Shift implies speed.  Blue light from a receding source
will be shifted toward the red end of the rainbow. This astronomers call a 'red shift'.</P>

<P>	Using distances derived from other sources, they concluded that the farther away a distant
galaxy was, the faster it was moving away from us. The exact proportionality of distance and
recession velocity meant something absolutely astounding.  It meant that the universe was expanding
uniformly.  Wherever in the universe they viewed moderately distant galaxies, they all lay along the
same Hubble's Law straight line.  If one thinks backwards,  thinking of gravity as a retarding force
to this expansion, the universe must have come from a ball of matter and energy in an explosion
named by Fred Hoyle thirty years later--'The Big Bang'.</P>

<P>	The exact mathematical relationship of Hubble's Law--and its implications--was worked out
by Robertson, a theoretical cosmologist. He then took this uniform expansion and made up what is
called a 'metric' or scaling geometry for it in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Later, the
Soviet Friedmann solved Einstein's equations, without understanding they were consistent with an
expanding universe.</P>

<P>      Since Hubble, Humason, Robertson, and Friedmann were all responsible for understanding the
data, we probably should call Hubble's Law, the Hubble-Humason-Robertson-Friedmann Law. :&gt;)

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Symbolism of the ocean: there is no ether--Einstein himself</P>

<BR WP="BR2">
<P>	One key to Friedmann's Gravitational theory was that gravity was the only force involved
in regulating the expansion. Certain discoveries over twenty years earlier made this assumption at
least temporarily reasonable.</P>

<P>	Nineteenth Century physicists tried to understand the nature of the propagation of light.  It
had been discovered to be an electromagnetic wave by the theory of Maxwell and the light-generating circuits of Hertz. The thinking was that all waves require a medium for the transmission
of energy.</P>

<P>	If that medium were still with respect to the 'fixed stars' the earth moving through it  should
have created a substantial ether wind.  Using a device accurate enough by twice to detect such a
wind, Michelson and Morley in 1900 bounced light off mirrors in different directions, but noticed
no change in the speed of light with direction. This meant that the earth was not ploughing through
some 'stationary' stuff in space, and that the speed of light could not be 'boosted'.</P>

<P>	Albert Einstein was developing a theory which harmonized with the Michelson-Morley
experiment. In 1905, as a clerk in the Patent Office in Germany, he published a theory that would
transform our understanding of motion forever. His special relativity required that the speed of light
would be the same for all observers, no matter how fast they were moving. This required that there
could be no motion through a medium that would add or subtract from that speed.</P>

<P>	This began to cement the idea in physicists minds that space was indeed empty. Light
required no medium, it was thought, for its transmission.  Could there be a medium for light that did
not behave like an ordinary fluid?  Is there something in empty space? Is there something that is
spongy that could act as a repulsive force?  These questions we will explore later in this book.</P>

<P>	This blanket denial of stuff in space was reasonable.  It was like the rational Starbuck 
observing that Ahab's obsession with white whale hunting was interfering with making a living
made by killing the much more abundant darker whales (like the dark matter hypothesis, we will
see later).  As Starbuck thought it absurd to strike out after the white leviathon, physicists and
astronomers for nine decades, for the most part, have thought it folly to search for a compressible
ether in space.</P>

of the Friedmann models.  </P>

<P>	Lemaitre's Universe (6) has a long quasi-stationary period, which was first thought to
explain an epoch where Quasars were at first thought to be formed.  Many of them were found
clustering at a certain distance which corresponded to a several billion years ago. (That was at a
redshift of z=2. Note, redshift, the relative change in wavelength/wavelength, relates to lookback
time.) Later, though, the need for this stable epoch evaporated as more Quasars were discovered at
much greater distances.</P>

early static phase extending into the infinite past. During the static phase, no galaxies could have

observations, it would seem that all that is left is the Bang-Whimper (3) and the DeSitter Universe

no matter in it. However, it may be that matter plus the vacuum behaves--on the large scale--in just
such a fashion. I first proposed this in 1986 in an abstract in the Astrophysical Journal. When I
discussed my ideas with Philip Peebles, the reigning expert on cosmological data at the time, he said
it was an interesting idea, which required more proof.  When Adam Riess and his group, studying
supernovae, in 1998 found that the current deceleration parameter, q<SUB>o</SUB>, is -1, as required for a
DeSitter Universe, I was ecstatic. This was in spite of the fact that the uncertainty in the result at that
time was rather large. Alan Guth's early inflationary epoch was also DeSitter in character--but with
no matter. </P>

<P>   A friend of Einstein's, a Dutch theoretician by the name of DeSitter in 1917 proposed a surprising
cosmology. He showed that the universe could expand every more rapidly--exponentially--if it had
no matter in it, only 'funny energy' in space described by Einstein's cosmological constant.  Hubble
had not discovered the expanding universe yet. That came nearly 10 years later.</P>

<P>   DeSitter's suggestion was a wild stab in the dark with no evidence to back it up. However, if one
believes in intuition, it was a great signet of what was to come. Not only was it the first proposed
expanding universe, but the expansion laid the way for a very important phase in cosmological
wandering--the Steady State Universe.</P>

<P>   The emptiness of the De Sitter universe could be justified by saying that the 'funny energy' of the
Cosmological Constant dominated over the effects of gravity, and it just may be what our universe
will end up like.  So his theory is very probably an asymptotic description of our present
cosmological knowledge.  At least in the future, the universe will probably break free of its
gravitational bonds, and expand under the influence of the cosmological 'funny energy' in space
itself.  That is, as long as the funny energy obeys Einstein's requirement that its density remain
constant, a cosmological constant.  We will see later that other types of 'funny energy' have been
proposed which would accelerate universal expansion, but none of them at this point seem as likely
as a cosmological constant, simply for the reason that they would violate Einstein's General Theory
of Relativity-the comfort zone of many physicists. </P>

<P>   DeSitter's universe is a flat universe.  The curvature constant, k, is zero, and the mass density is
zero in the Friedman equations. The Hubble constant is proportional to the square root of the
Cosmological Constant, &lambda;, implying the scale of distances increases as an exponential function
of time. An important measure is the deceleration parameter, q, describing how fast the universe is
slowing down.  This remains constant at q = - 1, and the negative value means the universe is
speeding up, not decelerating. This is the very value which the Adam Riess group from Berkeley
Labs reported with the first big batch of redshifts of moderately distant supernovae. Could it be that
the universe behaves as if it is empty?</P>

<P>   In a way, the DeSitter Universe is a steady state universe.  In the conventional way of looking at
it, the density of matter remains constant at zero, even though two observers will drift apart
exponentially. The universe always looks the same. This is all mathematical and hypothetical--don't
ask me how two observers get to exist in a universe without matter. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   One of the fascinating features of a pure DeSitter universe is that it has no beginning.  It is a way
of putting off the question, 'where does the universe come from'.  It never was infinitesimally small,
so there is no cause required.  At least that was the argument Gold and Bondi gave for the first De
Sitter-like cosmological model which proposed to match the evidence--the Steady State Universe
with matter in it.</P>

<P>    To produce such a universe, Gold and Bondi proposed not only that the universe should look the
same throughout all space, but throughout all time.  Sameness throughout all space had been tagged
as 'The Cosmological Principle'. Space-time sameness they now called the 'Perfect Cosmological
Principle'. In the form they gave it, however, it was not so perfect. We have found that the universe
does evolve.  Nevertheless, the concept prompted the search for cosmic evolution, and gave some
mathematical tools which may help us to model possible objects called 'white holes', for example.</P>

<P>    To maintain a constant matter density, the Steady State Universe had to involve continuous
creation of matter in space at a rate too small to be detected.  The rate of matter creation in the
theory had to exactly fill in the empty space left by the expansion of the universe.  This assumption
was completely ad hoc, and thought by some to be a flaw in the theory. </P>

<P>   Pascal Jordan in 1933 had modified General Relativity with new mathematical objects called
scalar-tensors which he said would produce 'drops' of created matter in space.  However, there was
no evidence indicating that Einstein's theory needed to be modified. </P>

<P>   Fred Hoyle created new objects within Einstein's General Relativity called C operators which did
the job. He is thus credited with inventing the theoretical equipment to make Steady State work. 
However, his theory gave no indication of what form the created  matter would take.  </P>

<P>   The Steady State universe doubles its matter content in one third of the Hubble time (1/Ho).  It
expands exponentially as in the DeSitter Universe, and the deceleration parameter is q = - 1. One
third the Hubble time is about 4 or 5 billion years, and is indicative of the average age of  galaxies
in the theory.  The Milky Way galaxy is about 12-14 billion years old, making it quite out of the
ordinary.  In the regular big bang universe, most galaxies are the age of the Milky Way, more or less.

<P>   The second reason for the rejection of Steady State theories came in the late '60s with the
discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by Penzias and Wilson. They were working
on microwave communications at Bell Labs, utilizing a horn-shaped antenna. They noticed they
were receiving a mysterious noise, no matter what direction they pointed it.</P>

<P>   Thinking it was caused by pigeon droppings, they cleared the horn--to no avail.  They soon
realized that the wavelength of this radiation corresponded closely to the energy predicted by George
Gamow 20 years earlier as a remnant of the fireball of the Big Bang. They had discovered the
cosmic microwave background.</P>

<P>   300,000 years after the Big Bang, in most theories, the universe was a soup composed mainly of
light, protons, and electrons. Enough space had evolved so that the energy of the light couldn't keep
the electrons from going into 'orbit' about the protons. As the electrons fell into orbit, they released
ultraviolet photons of a specific energy.  The universe expanded, and space with it, increasing the
wavelength of the light from ultraviolet to microwaves.  Ultraviolet has wavelength of a few
billionths of a meter, and microwaves a few centimeters, so this was a substantial stretch. I usually
illustrate this in my classes by pulling on the ends of a coat-hanger wire I have bent into a sine wave. 
</P>

<P>   The era that generated the background is called the 'Recombination Era' because electrons are
recombining with protons. The light radiation released is also sometimes called 'recombination
radiation'.</P>

<P>   The CMB is thus one of the great proofs of the Big Bang.  The microwave background  is difficult
to explain in a universe that is never dense enough in the past to prevent electrons and protons from
being together.  Thus the Steady State Universe requires some special circumstance to explain the
background: super-massive stars or masses varying with time, for example.</P>

<P>   CMB has so many implications that it really deserves a chapter by itself.  It is actually a spread
of wavelengths with a peak at a specific wavelength.  We call this a Black Body Spectrum because
a black body, a star, a hole in an electromagnetic cavity resonator, all give off this characteristic
spread of photon energies. A dense cloud of gas in equilibrium with itself produces it, and leaves
a clue as to its temperature. Wien's law tells us that the peak wavelength is related to that
temperature.  For CMB the corresponding temperature is 2.7 degrees above absolute zero--very low
indeed.</P>

<P>   One of the first things that was done was to identify the shape of the black body curve which
would be expected if the radiation was a remnant of the Big Bang. That was done, and  remarkably
the radiation was coming from all over the sky with very close to the same intensity, betraying a
uniformity reminiscent of the primordial gas.</P>

<P>    In the early '80s, however, George Smoot and his team from UC Berkeley investigated the
microwave background with COBE, the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite. They found
something remarkable.  There were small variations of temperature of a few parts in a million, just
large enough to be tracers of the original lumpiness of the matter at the Recombination Era. These
are just the right size, under the influence of long-term gravity, to become galaxies, clusters of
galaxies, and stars.  In addition the spread of lump sizes were just those expected in the Inflationary
Theory of the quantum generation of the universe.  We will have much to say about this later.</P>

<P>   The important fact now is that CMB is a nearly indigestible fact for most Steady State Theories,
though some, including Peebles, don't consider it to be a devastating blow to the theory.  Cosmic
evolution is.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">How dangerous is Moby Dick?  Conflict over The Hubble Constant </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   There are 10 numbers now reputed by some to be necessary to determine Cosmology.  They call
it the 'ten parameter' theory.  We have talked about the mass density of the universe, the size of the
cosmological constant energy density, , and the current deceleration constant, q<SUB>0</SUB>, but the first
number we expected to pin down was the Hubble Constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>. This is because it can be determined
using fairly nearby galaxies.</P>

<P>   The Hubble Constant is the slope of the Hubble's Law plot, the ratio of recession velocity and
distance.  We get recession velocity from the redshift of a galactic spectrum, so if we can find a
galaxy's distance accurately we get a good value for H<SUB>0</SUB>.  This tells us how fast the universe is
expanding in the present epoch. This is the first approximation for the lower redshift or distance end
of the Hubble plot, which is all the farther Hubble got.  It is of prime importance because it starts
our quest for cosmology being essentially for the first approximation of how the universe has
expanded. It answers the question: how is the universe expanding now?</P>

<P>   If we get q<SUB>o</SUB>, the current deceleration  parameter, we get the second approximation, or how
the  universe expanded in the moderately recent past. It tells us how the Hubble plot is shaped in
moderate redshift regions. The problem was, there was much dispute over both constants. This dispute more or less ended in the year 2000.</P>

<P>   Let's consider H<SUB>0</SUB>. Some history is in order, to give us a clear perspective of how difficult the task
of pinning it down is.  Up until the late forties, early fifties, it was thought that the time since the Big Bang was much
shorter than it is now. This was because the Cepheid variable star 'yardstick' for size was about a
factor of 5 too small. The main yardstick for close by galaxies was off by that factor, and thus more
distant galactic distances were off too, because those distances were based on the nearby measuring
technique.</P>

<P>   Hubble found the distance to the nearby Andromeda galaxy by observing what are called Cepheid
Variable stars in that conglomeration.  In about 1912, Henrietta Leavitt from Harvard gave us one
of our most powerful distance-determining techniques. Cepheid Variables oscillate in brightness
over a period of one to 50 days, but each star dims and brightens with regularity.  Leavitt found that
the longer the period of variation the greater the star's luminosity--power output at the source.  From
luminosity and apparent brightness at earth (called flux) one can obtain their distance (now called
Luminosity distance, d<SUB>L</SUB>).  By using other methods to obtain the luminosity of closer Cepheids she
hoped to be able to determine  distance to more distant ones. However, her research and that which
followed was flawed by the fatal distance factor, because intervening dust was obscuring was
lowering the intensity of light from the clusters she used to calibrate these stars. There was also
confusion, because  Cepheid variable stars in globular clusters turned out to have a different
distance scale than those in  spiral arms of spiral galaxies.</P>

<P>  Thus for 20 or 30 years it was thought that the universe was only about 3 billion years old, which
was fine because we hadn't encountered anything older.  Then in the early '50s, we radioactively
dated rocks on the earth at 4.5 billion years old.  This 'time conflict' was another factor which led
Bondi and Gold to their infinite-universal-age Steady State theories.  Ordinary Friedmann
cosmology wouldn't allow such antiquity. </P>

<P>  More accurate determinations of the Hubble constant were made, implying the universe was also
about 5 times larger than once thought-distance scales were up by 5.  Alan Sandage, Hubble's
replacement at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, managed this refinement. However, the confidence in
the Sandage value of H<SUB>0</SUB> eroded in the 1980's when new determinations of the Hubble Constant
emerged which were higher by about 50%.  In the late 1990's the debate heated up with Wendy
Friedman and her group, using what is thought to be the most accurate method of scaling the
universe-Cepheid variables.</P>

<P>   Before the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was fully operational, it was impossible to see Cepheid
variable stars in nearby galaxies in the Local Group. However, HST allowed Wendy and her
Harvard-based group to work with Cepheids in the nearby Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Since Cepheid
variables were thought to be accurate to within about 7%, we now have most astronomers settling
on a Hubble Constant of about 75 km/s/Megaparsec. This is about 35% larger than Sandage's
stubborn claim of 55. Though Sandage still sticks to his 'guns', which are big guns, by the
way, supernova type Ia, cosmologists are drifting into the Friedmann camp.</P>

<P>   </P>

<P>	Friedmann's large Hubble Constant makes the age of the universe problematic, if one
ignores a cosmological constant. In standard General Relativistic cosmological models, the new H<SUB>0 
</SUB>means the universe cannot have been older than 13 billion years, and that's really stretching it.
When Friedmann first announced her results, the age was forced under 11 billion years, but under
pressure and supposed 'closer examination', H<SUB>0</SUB> was decreased, increasing the age limit.</P>

<P>   When the 11 billion year age figure was announced, all hell broke loose in the cosmological
world. After all, the stars in the globular clusters of the Milky Way were at the very least12 billion
years old, a figure difficult to fudge. Additionally, now the oldest galaxy we have found is at
minimum 13 billion years, and there are perhaps quasars as old as 14 or even 15 billion years!!  We
may still have a problem as we look for older objects.  Even stretching the age to 13 billion years
may not fit.  We call this the 'time problem' in cosmology. </P>

<P>   The time problem was made even worse if one accepts theoretical demands that the density of the
universe be as large as the critical value necessary for the Inflationary Scenario of Alan Guth and
others.  9 Billion years was incredibly small for those espousing a particle physics-driven early
period of exponential expansion.  It seemed that the 'inner space-outer space' connection--relating
particle physics to Cosmology was absurd.  It was at that point that the particle physics cosmologists
like Michael Turner from the University of Chicago began to seriously consider the return of
Einstein's 'greatest blunder', the cosmological constant. Michael Turner's lectures had become very
popular, with entertaining graphical illustrations, and he became the spokesman for the 'inner space'
connection.   The reemerging cosmological constant was required by observations to be very small.
This was still an embarrassment for particle theory. Theorists had calculated that empty space
should have an absurdly large cosmological constant or none at all.  Nevertheless, they swallowed
their pride in the face of necessity.  </P>

<P>   It's like the old man who bought a pair of shoes too small to fit in a second hand store. He paid
half the price of a new pair to get them stretched, and they didn't fit.  He tried getting them stretched
a second time, but found he couldn't even use a new shoehorn to get his feet in them. In desperation
he bought a new pair, paying double the price he would have if he had bought the new ones in the
beginning.</P>

<P>   A new cosmological theory was needed. We had outgrown our cosmological 'shoes' several times
and we still clung to shoes that didn't fit. The oldest objects we are seeing now are claimed to be
products of a just-born universe, but are they?  When the cosmological constant is thrown into the
mix, the time problem is not as severe. However, it will be humorous to look back on the difficulty
in the paradigm shift if we start discovering we need theories with objects 17, 20, or even 25 billion
years old. </P>

<P>  I have perhaps nothing but intuition to back me up, but I will take on the first wagerer with an
Astronomy PhD and only the first wagerer with the following bet. I'll bet we find objects which will

<P>   The first fairly recent indication of the sighting of the cosmological constant 'white whale' was
given by two researchers at the University of Hawaii in about 1985. They were investigating the
peculiar velocity of the Milky Way relative to the Hubble flow and found that the local group of
galaxies was  falling into a nearby rich cluster-the Virgo Cluster.</P>

<P>   The Virgo galactic cluster has hundreds of galaxies grouped about a supergiant elliptical called
M87, one of the largest galaxies we have seen.  Tully and Shaya from Hawaii were able to plot the
motion of the Milky Way and found it falling into that massive cluster.  Thus to measure the rate
of universal expansion using the redshift of galaxies in the Virgo cluster, it was necessary to add the
velocity of infall to the recession velocity to get the speed of Hubble expansion.  With the universe
thus expanding faster than was thought before, the flat universe needed for inflationary theories
required additional complexity to avoid having too little time.  Tully and Shaya claimed the
necessity for a cosmological constant to resolve the time problem created by a more rapidly
expanding universe. The particle cosmologists felt the bite as clearly as if they had lost their left arm
to the leviathon. </P>

<P>   I recall the reaction of some inflationary theorists was to go into kind of a denial.  They ignored
the warning sign for a long time, and still went on looking for extra matter-dark matter-to add to
visible matter. They needed to have exactly the critical density to make their theories work, and only
about a fifth of the matter required had been sighted or inferred gravitationally.  Never mind that
this was another weakness to the theory.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   The first indication of dark matter in the Milky Way was encountered by the Dutch astronomer
Jan  Oort. Oort measured velocities of stars that gravity makes bob up and down through 
the plane of our galaxy's disk--like horses on a
carousel. He could not account for their high bobbing speeds without hypothesizing more matter
than was seen in stars. He suggested an amount of  invisible matter equal to the visible matter.  
He would later discover the region beyond Pluto where most comets spend most of their
time-the famous Oort Cloud, another dark matter conglomeration. </P>

<P>   This suggestion was confirmed by observations of galactic rotation. In about 1970, Vera Rubin
and W. Kent Ford at the Carnegie Institute were first able to get some data accurately plotting
rotational speeds versus distance from the center in the nearby spiral Andromeda galaxy.  To Vera's
surprise, the linear velocity spread did not obey Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This meant that
the gravity of the stars they saw was not causing the rotation of galaxy.  The velocities remained
fairly constant as one observed further and further out from the center, whereas Keplerian motion
would have had them tail off, radically departing from what was seen.</P>

<P>   To observe the rotation curve of a galaxy, one has to block all but the portion one is observing and find the component of rotational speed in the line of sight from a Doppler redshift or
blueshift.  If the galaxy is not seen edge-on, a geometric correction must be made to find the actual
rotation speed. </P>

<P>  A few years later, Vera collaborated with David Burstein and Bradley Whitmore and observed and
analyzed dozens more spirals inclined toward the earth.  They all had a similar anomalous rotational
spread to Andromeda. The conclusion-not seen right away--was that gravity was acting to produce
this. The only reasonable way was to have an enormous amount of 'dark matter' interspersed
throughout the galaxy. Perhaps 1% of the matter needed to produce a flat universe had been seen
in stars at that time. Galaxy rotation curves upped the ante substantially, at least in principle.</P>

<P>   More than 200 galaxies have been measured since 1978, firmly establishing the necessity for dark
matter within them. This is in a proportion of about ten to one, lifting the matter inferred to occupy
the universe to about 10% of the critical density. Since then, we have found some of the dark mass
necessary, and although some of still eludes our view, only a radical dissenter like Milgrom (in the
early '80s) claimed that Newton's laws are violated for very large masses like galaxies. </P>

<P>   In 1973, however, Jeremy Ostriker and Philip Peebles constructed a computer model of the spiral
Milky Way, and found that stars could not remain in a disk of matter alone.  Some went flying off,
and others went into very eccentric orbits.  To maintain the spiral disk, they had to model it as being
embedded in a much larger spherical 'halo' of matter.  Observations have somewhat born out the
theory, and  it is now thought to be five to ten times the diameter of the visible star disk.  So it is
likely that a nearly equal amount of dark matter resides in the halo, far outside of the dark matter
in the disk.</P>

<P>   Call him a rebel, or a stubborn individualist, Fritz Zwicky established one of the most memorable
careers at Cal Tech.  His work led to the understanding of the neutron star. He was a master of
crystal and liquid physics.  Along with his collaborator, Walter Baade, supernovae were understood
as a source of cosmic rays.  He was able to have a special 18 inch wide-field telescope constructed
for him at Palomar by which he scanned the skies for supernovae.  He boasted that the only two who
knew how to use such a small telescope were he and Galileo.  In the process, he produced two
catalogs of galaxies: one of 30,000 galaxies in the northern hemisphere, and one of active galaxies
with bright cores.</P>

<P>   He rightfully, however, holds the claim to being the first discoverer of the necessity for dark
matter. In the early 1930's he studied the motion of galaxies in a rich cluster about 300 million light
years away.  The Coma cluster was found to have its hundreds of members swarming around each
other much faster than the masses of its members would indicate. To understand this, one merely
has to note that to remain in orbit around a larger planet than the earth requires a higher orbital
velocity.  It didn't take Zwicky long to realize that there was extra matter in that galactic cluster. 
In a Swiss physics journal he called it 'dunkle materie' (dark matter). That  was 1933, many decades
before Vera Rubin's encounter with extra matter in spiral galaxies.</P>

<P>   It was not long after that Sinclair Smith at Mt. Wilson Observatory applied Zwicky's techniques
and dark matter conclusion to the rich Virgo cluster of galaxies, surprisingly somewhat closer than
Coma. He concluded that there was "a great mass of internebular material within the cluster".</P>

<P>   We now know that if we use Rubin's masses, including the dark matter internal to galaxies
including the halos, it is still necessary to postulate about an equal amount of dark matter between
the galaxies, that is, if we wish to rescue Newton's Laws. This brings the tally of inferred dark
matter--at most--to about 20% of the critical density. </P>

<P>   Zwicky also paved the way to an independent way of assessing intergalactic dark matter. In 1937, he suggested for the first time that a galaxy might be weighed by noting its effect as a 'gravitational lens'.  Later he made the outrageous claim, 40 years ahead of the actual observation, that galaxies
and large masses could create multiple images or even a ring of images by the gravitational bending
of light.  This was similar to the way General Relativity says light bends around the sun.</P>

<P>   Looking at pictures of how light from distant galaxies passes through a large cluster of galaxies,
J. Anthony Tyson and his colleagues from Bell Labs were able to map the dark matter in the cluster,
Abell 1689.  A photograph, taken in the early 90's shows the distant galaxies as small circular arcs 
around the center of the cluster.  Utilizing this gravitational lensing effect, Tyson was able to map
the dark matter in the cluster. All told, then, there is 10-20 times more material acting
gravitationally, internal and external to galaxies than exists in stars.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The ocean appears calm.  Is the Universe Flat?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Is there more dark matter than the 10-20% of critical mass accounted for? Even considering the </P>

<P>missing mass of galaxies and galactic clusters, is it possible that this is not an effect of matter at all?</P>

<P>   The argument for even more dark matter is theoretical in the main.  As the universe expands, any
deviation from flat, Euclidean space-time is magnified by the expansion.  The fact that we are at
about 20% of critical mass is very close, considering that if we work this backward the universe
must have been within 100 trillionth of critical mass away from this critical value in the beginning. 
Such a finely tuned initial state of the universe is highly improbable. So why not postulate that
things were simple-exactly critical density for all time? Or at least a long time after a brief, rapid
inflationary period?</P>

<P>   The inflationary theory, explained in the next chapter, does just that.  It resolves this dilemma,
called the 'flatness problem', by postulating a nearly eternally flat universe: zero curvature. In a way,
however, without additional arguments, this is much like learning that someone shot a powerful bow
and arrow 5 miles. You are able to see the target was hit through powerful binoculars, but not which
part of the target. You then conclude that since it's so unlikely the target was hit, that there must
have been a way of aiming the arrow perfectly-that the arrow hit the exact center. This is absurd.
In other words, it is more reasonable to conclude that the 'arrow' did not hit the center of the target.
Similarly, reason suggests that it is possible there is no more than about 30% of critical density in
matter, and now modern observations confirm that. </P>

<P>   Philip Peebles, the Princeton author of the standard book on the evidence-<U>Physical Cosmology</U>--went through earlier phases where he doubted the flatness argument.  It is however, because of other

<P>   When models are computed for the maximum amount of normal matter formed in the Big Bang,
theorists can account for about 20% of critical density.  This normal matter, sometimes called
'baryonic matter' is made up primarily of baryons: protons and neutrons. Electrons make up a
negligible portion by mass.  Thus normal objects we know and love, which are composed of atoms,
could conceivably be all there is. And the majority of it might be hidden.  I joke with my students,
saying that 'God put most of the matter in the universe where the sun don't shine'. </P>

<P>   It is usually roughly assumed that when we look for the matter accounting for the gravitational
anomalies in galaxies and clusters that we are looking for baryonic matter.  However, 'it ain't
necessarily so'. Some of the baryonic matter may be distributed in realms between the galactic
clusters.  It is reasonably certain, though, that to justify critical density, we must look for exotic,
non-baryonic matter.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Baryonic Dark Matter</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Until the cosmic repulsion discovery in 1998, the most conservative among astronomers believed
that the only dark matter was to be found internal to galaxies and clusters.  Not only did they suggest
that it was only in the amount necessary to explain galactic motion, but that all of it was in ordinary,
baryonic form.</P>

<P>   Think of the many possibilities: dim or obscured galaxies, faint or failed stars, planets and black
holes, and interstellar gas and dust. And we keep discovering new forms.</P>

<P>    In the late '70's, the Einstein X-ray observatory satellite discovered that galactic clusters had globs
of x-ray emitting gas in and around them.  The Hydrogen gas inhabiting the regions between
galaxies  and voids between clusters is visible in the Radio.  We also keep seeing more and more
stars in galaxies as the light gathering capabilities of our telescopes increase with the area of their
apertures and the efficiency of detection technology.  Spiral galactic disks seen before and after increased 
ability to see look like doughnuts before and after deep frying.  There are also dark galaxies,
ineffective in producing stars and composed mainly of gas which decrease the matter needed to
explain cluster motions.  All of these together, though, make up only a small fraction of the mass
needed for galaxies and clusters to be Newtonian.</P>

<P>   In addition IRAS, a 1983 satellite viewing in the infrared, observed gas about newly forming stars. 
The protoplanetary disks of stars like Vega and Beta Pictoris became visible. These are young stars
with pre-planetary dust and rock surrounding them in doughnut-shaped disks. These disks were
estimated to be a factor contributing to dark matter for 50% of young stars.  However, we can do
a rough calculation. One thousandth of the mass of our solar system is in planets and debris.  So that
makes one half of one thousandth of a percent of critical mass in planets and protoplanetary disks.
That is tiny enough to make dark matter scavenger hunters go stark raving mad.</P>

<P>   Speculative forms of dark matter often don't stand theoretical tests.  Cold gas in a halo around
galaxies, would have fallen in since the Big Bang, and hot gas would radiate and be seen. Enough
dust to make up  a goodly amount of dark matter would obscure the stars. So if there is something
in the halo surrounding a spiral galaxy (of which there are many, especially early on), it must be in
a more condensed form.</P>

<P>    The most likely candidate for this condensed matter is MACHOS (massive compact halo objects).</P>

<P>In the formation of stars it is reasonable some clumps of matter will not have sufficient gravity to
have  the 0.08 solar masses necessary to kindle nuclear fusion at 10 million Kelvin degrees. We
know now that gas clouds come in all sizes, and like watery dough dropped into rapidly boiling oil,
they break up into a spectrum of sizes.  It is reasonable to assume that some gas lumps will not quite
be large enough to  kindle Hydrogen burning.  These failed stars should exist in an abundance
comparable to ordinary stars. However, since their mass is much smaller than the average star, we
cannot hope to make up  a substantial fraction of the missing mass in the disk or even core of a
galaxy.  </P>

<P>   Nevertheless, halo matter is probably much more sparse, and some astronomers say that failed
stars called brown dwarfs exist in the halo in the trillions and thus could make up as much as half
of the missing matter in galaxies.  This hope is fading somewhat, however, as the search for brown
dwarfs progresses. One such object has been found.  Gliesse 229B is 30-55 times the mass of
Jupiter, has a surface temperature of 1200 K, and its luminosity is six millionths that of the sun. 
First viewed at Palomar, this object has no metal spectral lines.</P>

<P>   The brown dwarf search also goes on, utilizing a gravitational lens effect.  When a brown dwarf
passes in front of a more distant star it acts like a magnifying glass focusing the sun and makes the
star behind appear much brighter.  The duration of the lensing event gives us the mass of the
MACHO. They act on one star in a million a year, and the bright stars in the halo are very sparse to
begin with. However, estimates from the number of lensing events seen in a year indicate that brown
dwarfs are not living up to early expectations.  There are probably much less than a trillion in the
Milky Way.</P>

<P>   We come to a rankling conclusion: that baryonic matter doesn't even explain the non-Keplerian
rotation curves of spiral galaxies.  In addition, baryonic matter is even more sparse between
galaxies, and thus we are even further away from explaining the 'Zwicky anomaly'-galaxies zipping

<P>   I was once stung by such an angry swarm of these creatures over a dozen times on the top of my
head.  I won't forget it.  In a way, gravitational astrophysics has been stung by the missing matter
hypothesis.  It is sad for observational astronomers to have to rely on theorists for explanations, but
that is apparently what must be done, at least for now.</P>

<P>   When I explain the above paucity of baryonic matter in galaxies, my students invariably come
back with what they think is a solution: 'What about black holes, Dr. Petersen?"  I sadly have to tell
them that stars with three solar masses left after losing a third of their mass in supergiant phases are
very rare.  They are the exception, not the rule.  "What about the supermassive black holes in the
centers of galaxies?" they might retort. I would have to tell them that if they made up a substantial
portion, the stars in and near the core would be moving much, much faster than we observe. And
what of the tell-tale traces of mini-black holes left over from the Big Bang?  They have never been
observed. After all Stephen Hawking has pointed out that the smaller a black hole is the faster it
evaporates. Evaporation in a puff of black body radiation of high temperature radiation would be
seen, and it hasn't.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    I used to tell my students, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that the search for dark matter is not very
scientific.  If it is truly dark we will never see it. So how can we hypothesize something we will
never observe? Seriously, though, it may also violate Popper's modern adaptation of Francis Bacon's
scientific method which says that an hypothesis must be disprovable. How can you ever show
something you can't observe doesn't exist?   </P>

<P>    For this reason, the challenge I hurl to the inflationary theorists, and even the missing matter
enthusiasts, is for them to prove that their hypothesized form of dark matter, or (even worse) critical
density can be observed or strongly inferred.  It looks as though now it can be inferred if we assume
there is something substantial in space which is probably not matter, WIMPS, or axions.  But before
I get into that great mystery, lets talk a bit about these exotic forms of non-baryonic matter.</P>

<P>   The number of neutrinos visible from the sun is only about 1/3rd of the number predicted by
ordinary nuclear physics. A neutrino is a very penetrating particle, difficult to detect, because it
passes through matter with a very, very low probability of interacting.  However, we have been able
to detect a fair number of them utilizing big tanks of stuff like what used to be used for cleaning
fluid until it was found to cause liver damage:  carbon tetrachloride.  Neutrinos interact by means
of the weak nuclear force, a weakly-coupling interaction which adjudicates beta decay--the decay
of a neutron into a proton plus electron plus neutrino. To run that one backwards-inverse beta
decay-requires rare circumstances, and so neutrinos are rarely detected as they change a proton into
a neutron and perform the nuclear alchemy of changing an element into one lower on the periodic
table. This can be chemically determined by examining the Carbon Tet for the expected impurity.</P>

<P>    One of the hypotheses to explain the missing solar neutrino mystery and tie together a new
unifying theory of physics called Supersymmetry is called the WIMP (weakly interacting massive
particle) theory. It's amusing that the two most famous candidate for dark matter are MACHOS and
WIMPS, the states men fear most as the extremes of male behavior :&gt;) . WIMPS act like pacman,
gobbling up neutrinos  in the sun, two for every three, if the parameters are adjusted to the
observations. If this Supersymmetry Theory is correct, WIMPS are electrically neutral, and really
wimpy: only detectable through their gravity.  Some speculative calculations indicate that WIMP
matter would be just enough to provide the critical density needed for the inflationary theory. </P>

<P>   To me and others, this reason for the existence of something we cannot hope to see is flim-flam.</P>

<P>Primack, who put forth the theory, once asked Martin Rees, a sensible conservative astrophysical
theorist, whether he believed in Wimps. He said "I give it about a 20% chance."  The theoretical
need for critical density could be considered handwaving. However, if other indications of this
Supersymmetry theory pan out, I might consider WIMPS. Strong men like me couldn't think that
wimps even exist, after all.  </P>

<P>   Pulling my tongue out of my cheek, the same arguments hold for axions.  In a theoretical going
out on a limb, Wilczek and Weinberg postulated a particle named after a laundry bleach alternative.
The going theory of unified particles suggested a neutron's spin should line up in a magnetic field.
It doesn't, so they invented the axion particle to explain why.  The 'new and improved' version of
the axion suggests they are a billion times lighter than the electron and that a billion of them should
occupy every cubic inch of space.  This would provide a substantial contribution to dark matter.</P>

<P>   It's all very theoretical, and it may be that WIMPS and AXIONS will go the way of 'quark
nuggets', shadow matter, magnetic monopoles, and other bizarre suggestions.  At one point, particle
physicists were wandering around beaches, metal detector-looking devices in hand, searching for
quark nuggets.  No one ever found any.</P>

<P>   The quest for exotic dark matter has now been all but abandoned, with the discovery that the
universe may achieve critical density by being composed of about 70% funny energy in space. I had 
to laugh that 13 years before that was discovered I was suggesting exactly that. Of course it was too
speculative at the time for my paper to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, but at least they
put my abstract in the back of the volume. It is also humorous, that my paper was rejected because
the reviewer thought space acting like negative mass was an 'impossibility'. Now that is exactly the
term being used, but it is really a negative pressure which is causing the repulsion. The funny energy
has positive mass density, and thus can contribute to the curvature of the universe in the same way
matter does.</P>

<P>    The thing they don't get yet, which I suggested a year later in a paper submitted to <U>Nature</U>
magazine and rejected for being too speculative, is the possibility that this funny energy in space can
be bunched up by galaxies and clusters and act like <U>positive</U> mass, thus providing a substantial
component of the galactic and cluster missing mass. This is an idea pioneered by Andrei Sakharov,
the great Soviet dissident and physicist. Space when squeezed acts like mass.  The question is: what
is its bulk modulus (measure of compressibility)?</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter 6 <STRONG>Ahab's Ivory Leg Breaks-Inflation in the Early Universe</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the <EM>Samuel Enderby </EM>of London, had
not been unattended with some small violence to his person. He had alighted with such energy on
a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock... he took plain practical
procedures: he called the carpenter. And when that functionary had appeared before him, he bade
him without further delay set about making a new leg." </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>    As Ahab was challenged by an untrustworthy leg, cosmology in the '80s encountered its
challenges too. In 1980, cosmologists were coming to grips with the reality and implications of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).  Regions opposite one another in the sky had basically the
same intensity of radiation coming toward the earth in opposite directions. The journey of these
'tired' photons had taken nearly as long as the time since the Big Bang.  This meant that they came
from regions twice the distance from each other in light years as the years since the Big Bang. Thus,
at the speed the universe was expanding, these regions could never have been in contact at the time
radiation was emitted. However, they are at the same temperature. How could they have come to
equilibrium?  They are, in effect, beyond each other's light speed horizon. This cosmologists called
the <U>horizon problem</U>.</P>

<P>     Another cosmological realization was that with the luminous matter density being about 2% and 
the inferred dynamical missing mass in galaxies and clusters adding about another 25%, the energy density of the universe was uncomfortably close to critical density. In fact, using the Friedmann
equations, it was possible to think back to the beginning and see that the energy density at Planck
time (10<SUP>-33 </SUP>seconds) must have been excruciatingly close to critical. Inferences were so close that
they thought it was ludricrous not to guess that it was exactly critical from the beginning, that the
universe was always flat.  This they called the <U>flatness problem</U>.</P>

<P>    This was the 'outer space' connection. Meanwhile, particle physics had gone through an 'inner
space' revolution. The exchange W and Z particles, which 'unified' the weak nuclear and
electromagnetic forces into one back in an extremely early epoch, had been discovered by Rubbio
and his crew. Work was proceeding toward the next higher level unification, called 'Grand
Unification'.  Even earlier than that epoch was projected an epoch in which the strong nuclear force
unified with the other two. Scientists were looking squarely into the eye of a phase change in space
very early on which separated out the two families of particles:  leptons (involved in the electroweak
force) and quarks (the purveyors of the strong nuclear force). </P>

<P>    In addition, particle theorists predicted that kinks in spacetime called magnetic monopoles should
have been produced in abundance by the Big Bang. Magnetic monopoles are separate magnetic
poles:  a south without a north or vice versa.. Friedmann expansion alone could not spread them out
enough to keep them from being numerous enough to detect. Yet none were detected.  This one
could call the '<U>magnetic monopole problem</U>'.</P>

<P>    The 'inner space' theorists also calculated that quantum contributions to empty space should be
very large in energy unless they were canceled by some unknown renormalization.  These
calculations were 10 to the 120<SUP>th</SUP> power larger than the present limits on the cosmological constant. Therefore, the cosmological constant was assumed to be completely canceled out (zero) by some unknown
mechanism.  This meant that theorists could not believe that the other 70% of critical density needed
for a flat universe could possibly be provided by a cosmological constant.  Thus began the search
for dark matter, even beyond the confines of that necessary for Newtonian behavior of galaxy
rotation and cluster dynamics.</P>

<P>    Looking back on this time, it was like a dark night before the first glimmer of an 'outer
space-innerspace' connection. This was provided by Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Because his idea of inflation in the early universe addressed three of these problems,
it became the rallying point of cosmologists and particle physicists, even though it required
tremendous refinements to even become workable hypothesis, much less a theory.</P>

<P>      Guth was contemplating what Grand Unification theories might have to say about the problems
indicated above, when he realized that the breaking of the symmetry of the unified quark-lepton
phase was like a phase transition from a false vacuum. Before this phase transition and after the quantum
foam period, matter should exist in a very strange state called a false vacuum. This false vacuum
was not empty, but full of energy density. This did a very strange thing. The energy scaled as the
volume, leaving the energy density the same. This implied that the universe underwent a very short
period of  exponential expansion. The universe should have been DeSitter at that time. </P>

<P>      The odd thing was that this meant that the space of the false vacuum actually ended up
expanding faster than light speed. This was space expanding and not objects moving past each other
above light speed, and therefore it was not prohibited by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.
That gave those now-distant regions of space emitting CMB (microwave background) a boost which
sent them double light distance away from each other, solving the horizon problem. </P>

<P>    Also, the tremendous rapid expansion diluted the matter and stretched out the curves in space like
great circles on a balloon blown up by a highly pressurized helium tank.  The flatness problem was
resolved, but only if the density of the universe is presently critical. This meant that a search for the
70% non-dynamical dark matter was on, since almost no one clung to a cosmological constant.
However, the resistance to hypothesizing something that had such shaky justification was
substantial, particularly among observational astronomers.</P>

<P>   The monopole problem also was solved by inflation spreading out the many monopoles so thinly
that it was likely none would be detected.</P>

<P>    I must admit, that when I learned of the Inflationary Theory, the search for non-dynamical dark
matter made me feel very queezy. Immediately I sided with the necessity for a cosmological
constant to make up the deficit, in spite of the fact that only a few considered it even a possibility. 
I did not like critical dark matter because of the non-disprovability of the hypothesis.  How could
you ever prove that 70% of critical density was <U>not</U> out there as non-dynamical dark matter as
distinct from a cosmological constant?  Therefore, the theory, in my mind, did not live up to Carl
Popper's addendum to the scientific method which demanded every hypothesis to be disprovable. </P>

<P>    In addition, I had reservations about inflationary theory <U>with</U> a cosmological constant.  Though
no one else was saying it at the time, because most were denying a non-zero , I claimed in a lecture
at the University of California at San Diego I gave as a grad student in 1986, that the need for
lambda presented a fine tuning problem much like the closeness to critical density. I figured that it
was very mysterious that dynamical matter was so close in value to the necessary lambda. This
meant a super-humongous fine tuning shortly after the Big Bang. I called it the 'lambda problem',
and presented a theory I will discuss later in the book, with some adaptations.  This 'lambda
problem' is now considered to be a big mystery, with supernova observations indication it is non-zero with a 99% probability.</P>

<P>   Though Guth's inflation solved these three major problems in cosmology, it was found to be
ultimately unworkable as it stood. To understand why, we need a deeper picture of his scenario. 
Energy-wise, the false vacuum which made his universe briefly expand exponentially was like a
marble in a dent on top of a Mexican hat.  The marble could roll down to the brim ending inflation,
if it could get out of the dent. Classically, it didn't have enough energy to do that. However,
quantum theory says that there is a probability that the marble will tunnel through the circular bump
around the dent in a given time.  Another way of thinking about it is that the marble is uncertain
about its energy by the uncertainty principle just enough to leap over the lump on the edge after a
certain probabilistic waiting period. Statistically, it is like radioactive decay, with a half-life in
which the probability is 50% it will tunnel. Before it does, the universe expands with humongous
inflation, due to the false vacuum energy. </P>

<P>   The 'marble'-ous universe then rolls into the brim somewhere on its circumference, ending
inflation, but the extra potential energy it had at the top is converted into kinetic energy. It oscillates
in the brim as that energy is converted into the particles that make up the universe.</P>

<P>   Sounds great, but like water boiling when it changes phase, normal space first forms 'bubbles' in
the false vacuum.  To make the present universe, the bubbles must join up in a process of
percolation, like in rapidly boiling water, except that it is going from a high temperature phase to
a low temperature phase. Careful calculations showed that percolation does not occur.</P>

<P>   The idea is that the false vacuum is expanding faster than the speed of light and the bubbles are
expanding slower. Though it requires mathematical proof, this means that the space in between the
bubbles grows too fast to allow bubbles to combine in large numbers.  Without this process, it was
thought that there was no way to produce our universe with an inflationary scenario.  There was no
'graceful exit' to inflation.</P>

<P>    Stephen Hawking suggested that if the Mexican Hat potential were sufficiently flat in slope that
one bubble would expand sufficiently to make the universe because the inflationary period would
be longer.  However, experts in particle theory had a hard time finding the right 'hat'.</P>

<P>   The general excitement of swatting three 'flies' with one blow--solving the three cosmological
problems with inflation-made particle physicists hungry for the hunt for a slow-rolling descent
down the 'hat'. Andrei Linde, a cheerful soviet  particle expert, had earlier beat Guth to the basic
idea of inflation. He first suggested that a phase transition might drive the expanding universe, but
did not note how it would solve the three 'problems'. </P>

<P>   Now he cut to the chase, and found, about the same time as Steinhardt and Albrecht from the
University of Pennsylvania, that Coleman and Weinberg had a Grand Unified Theory (GUT)
potential that was slow rolling enough to allow the universe time to expand from one large  bubble.
In addition, it did not require a dented 'hat' and quantum tunneling.  The ball merely rolled down
the hill slowly enough to allow a large bubble to form.  It's sort of like blowing a large soap bubble
by proceeding slowly and calmly. This slow-rolling potential became the archetype for most future
inflationary theories, though there were other problems with the particular potential they chose and
the version of GUT it was based on.</P>

<P>    The Coleman-Weinberg potential was natural in a brand of Grand Unified Theory in vogue at the
time, which predicted that the proton--the cornerstone  of atomic theory-should decay. If protons
decay, matter eventually transforms into non-atomic forms, and the chemistry we know and love
becomes extinct. Nevertheless, such a transformation was predicted to take an inordinately long
time. </P>

<P>    At first experiments utilizing tanks of material seemed to produce a fair number of decays, but
when larger, more reliable systems were used, none were found. Thus the original observations were
considered spurious. The length of time in which that particular brand of GUT said a proton should
decay was out of the question. Thus the search for a new slow-rolling potential was initiated.</P>

<P>    The other objection to the new inflation was more telling, and seemed to legislate against new
brands of GUT as well. With everyone madly laboring night and day on the implications of Guth's
paradigm, a conference was held which focused on one problem: would Guth's inflation provide
the right initial conditions for forming stars and galaxies?</P>

<P>   The Nuffield Workshop in 1982 brought it all to a head.  It had been found by several researchers
that inflation produces a scale free spectrum of primordial lumps. This is a boon for the production
of matter, as we know it. All sizes would be produced with equal probability, and that is exactly
what we see. This was the fourth great victory for inflation.  However, the difficult calculations
provided an amplitude for these perturbations off substantially from what was thought to be
necessary.  Though the COBE satellite a decade later would change the expectations slightly, they
were roughly correct, and this is a result that still stands. GUT theories cannot give the  right
amplitude to primordial density fluctuations. They are off by a whopping factor  of 10 to the 5<SUP>th</SUP>. This
meant that the slow rolling potential needed to be 10 trillion times flatter.  In fact, no known particle
theory can accommodate the measured amplitude of the fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave
Radiation.</P>

<P>   Since inflation was so impelling a paradigm, the ad hoc 'inflaton field' was invented, based not
on particle theory, as we know it, but on the required density fluctuation amplitude alone.  The hope
was that the particle theory would come later. The inflaton field replaced the Higgs field of GUT
as the reason for inflation. At least in its simple form, no one has been able to justify the inflaton
field  in terms of 'inner space' particle physics.  It remains ad hoc, standing on the basis of the four
major cosmological problems which inflation resolves, not on any established particle physics.  This
is sad, in a way, for the 'inner space-outer space' dream: that particle physics and cosmology should
harmonize in some fundamental fashion. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The track of the whales-the immortal(?) ocean: Chaotic and Eternal Inflation.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Andrei Linde has raised some of the most fascinating issues relating to the inflation paradigm. 
Not only was he the first to conceive of the inflation idea, but he also gave birth to two ideas which
expand our vista to include the universe beyond our own observable region.</P>

<P>   His first great contribution to our understanding of the 'unobservable universe' was 'chaotic
inflation'. In this theory, the inflaton field is a random fluctuation with a varying magnitude
throughout different regions of space. The shape of the potential causing the 'roll down' is like a
bowl, and different locations in space, having different values of the field, would be higher or lower
up the side of the bowl to start with. Thus the potential energy of different regions is greater or
smaller, providing more or less inflation.</P>

<P>    In some regions of the universe, like ours, where there is sufficient inflation, the curvature is flat. 
Where there is less inflation, the universe would look quite different. We just happen to be in a flat
portion. This takes away the necessity of providing an initial value for the false vacuum energy-it
is randomly chosen by quantum fluctuations.  The problem, of course with such a speculation is that
it is not provable, unless of course we are able to observe a region of the universe which had
different initial conditions. However, it looks like the microwave background is quite uniform,
ruling that out.</P>

<P>   This raises the interesting question as to whether such theories are worth proposing. They do not
pass the Popper 'disprovability' test. However, Occam's razor says that as an hypothesis it is better
because it is simpler. Without it, we must come up with a complicated scenario to provide an initial
height to the hill. Occam was no popper, but he was very sharp.</P>

<P>   Superstring theory is another instance of violation of our usual scientific method, in that we cannot
make a single prediction (though we are on the verge) using the complex superstring equations, and
yet they include all we presently know about particles. Prediction and verification is the essence of
the Baconian method. However, we may eventually discover a form of superstring theory which
yields predictable results.</P>

<P>   Linde's second great coup is his concept of 'eternal inflation', again non-disprovable, but perhaps
comforting and completing the inflation picture. If we consider the possibility that a region of false
vacuum could appear as a random quantum fluctuation in a normal universe, then normal universes
could spawn inflationary 'babies'. If one takes that process backward, the overall universe could be
composed of relatively isolated regular 'pocket universes' resulting from regions where inflation
has ended. Parts of a false vacuum universe might 'decay' first, while the space in between expands
rapidly, remaining in the false vacuum. The rapid expansion of space in between regular universes
would keep them from joining together, i. e., percolating.</P>

<P>   In such a scenario, it is possible to conceive that the overall universe never had a beginning. The
regular universes spawn false vacuums which lead to regular universes, 'worlds without end'. It is
also possible that our region of the universe might suddenly become a false vacuum and inflate
rapidly-what a way to go!  In addition, it is conceivable we could create a false vacuum artificially, 
and give birth to a Big Bang. The density of energy necessary for such an artificial creation,
however, is way beyond our technological means. We must create a density equivalent to 10 to the
80<SUP>th</SUP> power grams per cubic centimeter, heated to 10 to the 29 K temperature and then rapidly
cooled.</P>

<P>Maybe after a million years more progress?</P>

<P>  The 'no beginning' speculation of Linde has been challenged by the work of Borde and Vilenkin,
which says that in a 'pocket universe' picture an open universe must have a beginning.  That perhaps
gives comfort to those who have religious inclinations. One could have an interesting panel
discussion as to whether scientific hypotheses are at all correlated to the beliefs of their 'creators',
and as to whether that biases the research.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Ship, the Ocean, and the Whale-Matter, Curvature, and the Cosmological Constant</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, three different possible effects drive the expansion of
the universe.  They are: 1)  the gravitational effect of the matter in the universe, slowing it down;
2) the effect of the overall curvature of the universe, slowing it down, speeding it up, or zero,
depending on the value of what is called the curvature constant and the relative size of the other two
effects; and 3) the cosmological constant, speeding up the expansion. It is the interplay and
magnitude of these three effects which determines the rate of expansion at any time.</P>

<P>   The amount of matter in the universe is certainly not zero, and we estimate that about 10% of
critical density  is visible in the form of stars and another 20% (these estimates vary) is inferred to
exist as dark matter from the rotation curves of galaxies and motions of galactic clusters as well as
in the intergalactic medium. In the accepted picture, it retards the expanding universe just like a ball
thrown up slows down because of the gravity of the earth. However, this does not have to be the
dominating effect, as was thought by many cosmologists prior to 1998. </P>

<P>   It could be that a cosmological constant either overpowers the gravitational retardation with a
repulsive force, or did so in the past.  At any rate, the influence of the matter term in the
cosmological equation is usually assumed to be decreasing in its effect, simply because as space
expands the density of matter decreases proportionally. However, it is conceivable that this might
not be the case if matter is being created, say by a time varying energy in space. In fact, in the usual
inflationary theories the energy invested  in the 'false vacuum' actually changes into matter when
inflation terminates. This obeys the conservation of energy. However, for such a conversion to be
occurring presently, the Cosmological 'Constant', must vary with time, an effect not allowed in the
usual way of looking at Einstein's relativity. (There is a way out, I have found, however. But I will
consider that later. For now, I am giving you the conventional 'wisdom.) Since  we do not observe
the laws of relativity to be violated in the present, some say that such a time variation of the
cosmological constant could not be happening now.  Nevertheless, there might be violations too
small to be observed.</P>

<P>   Further, the Cosmological Constant is believed to originate in the virtual vacuum states of particle
species. The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle of quantum theory allows particle antiparticle pairs
to appear and disappear 'without cause', so to speak.  The Uncertainty Principle allows the mass
energy of the particles to exist for a certain length of time.</P>

<P>   The Friedmann equations say that the curvature term in the expansion equation, if it is not zero,
depends on the inverse square of the scale of space-time. Thus it is sure that at least some time in
the future it will become negligible. This  is sort of like observing a very large balloon being blown
up. Eventually the balloon reaches the size of the earth, for example, and appears to be flat to a
dweller on the surface. Although the universe may be more like an infinite saddle shape rather than
a balloon in space-time, the same effect holds.  Inflationary theorists say that the rapid expansion
of the universe during an early inflationary period already has made the curvature term negligible.
However, it is possible but not likely that we are under continual inflation at a much lower rate and
thus it may not be so.</P>

<P>   To most astronomers and particle physicists, the key issue is whether the Cosmological Constant
is non-zero at present.  With the supernova observations reported in1998, it is likely that it is. The
consensus is, however, that 'life' on the cosmic ocean may not be as simple as General Relativity
suggests, particularly in the early universe where it is suspected that quantum effects are important
and perhaps objects like superstrings play a part in the universal evolution.</P>

<P>   In <U>Moby Dick</U>, those who have never seen the white whale assume that he exists because of the
wild stories and the injured limbs.  In physics it has been theoretically inferred that the cosmological
constant is 120 orders of magnitude larger than the observational upper limit on its value. </P>

<P>   A vacuum is usually considered to be the ground state, or lowest energy, of a quantum system. For 
space in this ground state to obey the Special Theory of relativity, it must look the same to all
inertial observers (small acccelerations), regardless of their motion. This requires that the metric
functions representing the curvature of spacetime must all be constants. This is called the
Minkowski Metric.</P>

<P>   This vacuum is thus what is called 'a perfect fluid', which implies that its pressure is the negative
of the density.  This relationship between energy density and pressure is a peculiar equation of state
required by Einstein's Special Theory. A negative pressure is like a pressure applied from the inside
pushing out-cosmic repulsion.  The work done by this pressure is what creates the extra energy as
the universe expands, keeping the vacuum energy density constant. No heat is flowing in our out of
the universe. This requirement is that of what is called an 'adiabatic' expansion. The cosmological
constant is a constant  multiple of the constant vacuum energy density.</P>

<P>   When we do classical mechanics ala Newton we generally think of the vacuum as containing no
energy. However, we actually could set its potential energy to be anything we want, as long as it is
constant. Such an arbitrary constant does not affect the motion, and it is usually chosen for
convenience in the problem.</P>

<P>    However, in particle physics, quantum theory applies and the vacuum has a zero point energy, a
ground state which does affect the motion of the universe (if it is non-zero) by manifesting as the
cosmological constant. Quantum Field Theory suggests that vibrations of all different energies
manifest as fluctuations creating virtual particle pairs in space. </P>

<P>   Think of a very strange field in which grass grows to all possible lengths all the way to infinite.
The length of a blade represents the energy of a zero point oscillation, and no two blades have the
same 'energy'. A specialized 'lawn mower' comes along and pulls out by the root all blades over
a certain length. If all lengths were allowed, without this selective pruning, the sum of all the
lengths--the total energy would be infinite. Since the next energy above visible light is the
ultraviolet, this is called the 'ultraviolet divergence'. </P>

<P>     The energy at which the 'cutoff' occurs is called the 'Planck energy'.  This is the point at which
field theory is expected to break down due to random quantum processing. When the energy of all
the little 'vibrators' up to that cutoff are added up, the energy density gives a value for the
cosmological constant about 120 powers of 10 larger than the observational upper limit for that
constant. Something is rotten in Denmark, or should I say on the grassy knoll. This discrepancy
between theory and observation is sometimes called 'the physicist's cosmological constant
problem'.</P>

<P>  In addition, we know there is some kind of vacuum energy when we move two conducting plates
very close together.  They experience a measurable attractive force known as the Casimir effect,
predicted by Casimir in 1948 and measured in 1957 by Sparnaay.  The force becomes unmeasurably
small when we move them far apart, however, so this doesn't help us determine the 'bare'
cosmological constant.</P>

<P>   In fact, the observational upper limit for the cosmological constant is determined by an particle
pair energy of  1/100 th of an electron volt.  That is the kinetic energy an electron would gain in
being accelerated through a potential difference of 0.01 Volts. What a non-functional TV set
electrons like that would make-the phosphor wouldn't even light up as the electrons hit the screen!</P>

<P>   No one has a clear idea how to do an accurate calculation of the cosmological constant from first
principles.  Some fabulous cancellations probably must occur, however, to make it so small. Perhaps
a complete  quantum gravity theory will provide some insight, and the current candidate is
superstring theory, or a more general class called M theory. Other theorists are examining the
supersymmetry idea, in which all particles become one at high energies. </P>

<P>   Also, if we are to fully accept a variant of Guth's early inflationary theory, we must conceive of
some reasonable way the universe could have had such a large cosmological constant during the
brief period of rapid inflation and such a small one now. We will discuss some of the speculative
theories being developed later in the book.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   The 'weight' of tales about the whale itself and the 'weight' of tales of his havoc upon mankind
influence the overall dynamics of white whale hunting. In the same way, the relative density of the
cosmological constant added to the relative density of matter is thought to determine whether the
universe will expand forever, recollapse, or asymptotically approach a state with constant expansion
velocity. </P>

<P>   This is expressed by a very simple equation:</P>

<P>                   </P>

<P>                     is  matter density/critical density + cosmological const./critical density = 1? </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Or is this sum less than or greater than 1?  This formulation characterizes the motion of the universe
for all time in terms of two constants which could be presently measurable.  It should be noted that
the curvature factor can be found from these two:  &Omega;<SUB>k </SUB>= 1 -  &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>- &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>.</P>

<P>  There is, however, an old way of characterizing the dynamics which gives a nice feel for the
universal motion.  It utilizes &Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> and a related constant called the current 'deceleration parameter', 
q<SUB>o</SUB> = (1/2)(&Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>-3 &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>).  This constant tells us the universe is decelerating if it is positive and
accelerating if it is negative.  Both formulations assume that matter influences the dynamics of the
universe in the normal General Relativity way, however.  This dynamics can also be derived using
Newton's Laws alone, as McCrea showed in the 1930s.  We introduce you to the simple equation
(1) above, because with its aid alone, you can understand the destiny of the universe.</P>

<P>    We can plot the expansion histories for various values of &Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> and &Omega;<SUB>tot</SUB>. This is indicated in the
figure below. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="crgrph1.gif"></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>If the amount of matter is constant and smaller than critical (extremely likely), its gravitational
influence will be diluted by the ever-growing volume of space. The net effect is that if the value of
 (or &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>) is positive, the universe will eventually engage in an unbounded exponential expansion. 
This is asymptotically a DeSitter Universe--with the density of matter so low it is virtually non-existent. This is exactly what present supernovae data seem to indicate for the final fate of the
universe.</P>

<P>   The loitering and no Big Bang regions seem to be excluded because &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB> > 0.2 and   &Omega;<SUB>tot</SUB> < 1.5.  The
conclusion is that the universe came from a Big Bang with no loitering and his headed toward a
DeSitter exponential expansion, functionally identical to the inflationary early universe, but not
identical in magnitude. This still leaves leeway for discovering other forms of dark matter in an
abundance 0.2 critical density.</P>

<P>   How long has the great white whale roamed the earth?  We would like to know the age of the
universe.  Cosmologists express the universal age in terms of what is called 'The Hubble Time'.
This is just T<SUB>H</SUB> = 1/Hubble Constant = 1/H<SUB>o</SUB>. The most probable models of expansion we have been
discussing all allow ages greater than T<SUB>H</SUB>. In fact, it is expected that the universe is somewhere
between one and two Hubble times old.  With current values for the Hubble constant and limits on
globular cluster ages, that means somewhere between 12 and 22 billion years old.  However, if
matter does not influence dynamics in the usual Newtonian way, as some (myself and Millgrom)
have suggested, it  is possible the universe is even older. In fact, an infinite age is obtained for an
eternally DeSitter universe.</P>

<P>   Thus it is that the cosmological constant changes not only the dynamical expansion of the universe
and its fate, but also increases its age.  This is a relief, as you will recall, because without it time
became extraordinarily cramped.</P>

<P>   The dynamical quantities of matter density and vacuum () density can be found if one knows,
for example, the redshift and what is called the 'luminosity distance' of an object.  As regards type
Ia supernovae, we know the Luminosity, wattage, or power output at the source which, along with
the amount of that power we intercept with our telescopes (flux), yields luminosity distance. They
are 'standard candles' within about 10% in brightness of each other. </P>

<P>   I tell my beginning astronomy students that flux, distance, and luminosity form a triangle.  If we
know two of them, we get the third as a bonus. We always can determine flux by measuring photons,
or light particles, hitting telescope surface area.  Thus luminosity gives distance and vice versa.
Distance determined from luminosity is called 'luminosity distance'.  </P>

<P>   Thus, conceivably, measurements of flux and redshift of Supernovae type Ia alone could
completely determine the dynamics of a matter, cosmological constant-dominated universe. This
is exactly what the Supernova studies by Riess' and Permutter's groups have tried to do.</P>

<P>   Another implication of the existence of a cosmological constant is that it should leave its traces
on  the numbers of objects per unit volume seen at differing epochs. Galaxies are an example of
countable objects.  If we know that the numbers of objects haven't changed with time, this too can
allow us to determine universal dynamics. The number of objects per solid angle and redshift is
what is called the 'comoving density'. This density depends on the Hubble constant, luminosity
distance, and &Omega;<SUB>tot</SUB>. Thus we can find out if  &Omega;<SUB>tot </SUB>is 1, for example, as the inflationary theory suggests.
Without knowing redshifts, but knowing number counts, we can also get both dynamical numbers 
 &Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> and  &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> and universal dynamics.  Loh attempted to narrow down the possibilities in 1986.</P>

<P>   The effect of the cosmological constant on the formation of lumps of matter which result in
galaxies is also appreciable. The variations of density which make up galaxies must be fine-tuned
to produce what we see.  Various models of dark matter and inflation seem to work well in
providing the 'scale  free' lumpiness we observe.  However, they have to be adapted to make room
for the cosmological constant. </P>

<P>   Variations of velocity around lumps of matter ('peculiar velocities') also are related to the
dynamical values of &Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> and  &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>.  Thus measuring their variation at different redshifts is also a way
of discriminating universal model. This method becomes sensitive to a cosmological constant at
redshifts greater than 1.  </P>

<P>     Perhaps the method of greatest promise is the ability of the gravitational lensing effect to
determine the value of the cosmological constant. Gravity bends light, and as the light from a quasar 
bends around a large galaxy, it sometimes makes for multiple images. The probability of this
happening at different redshift (ages) varies in a certain way for a certain cosmological model.
Presently, this is our second best way of getting at , and it seems to indicate that it is nonzero.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Former observations of the 'White Whale'-Truth or Fiction</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   How do we sort out the truth about the white whale? It is foundational to think through what we
reliably know from past observations.  This is the Starbuck approach. What do our past observations
tell us about the cosmological constant? Even before the supernova discoveries of 1998 there were
some hints that the 'white whale' of cosmology was alive and well.</P>

<P>   One of the greatest hints of the existence of a cosmological constant pre-Perlmutter deals with the
age of the universe. Not only did the pinning down of the Hubble constant at a high value by Wendy
Freedman and group from Harvard yield a universe suspiciously too young for the stars in it without
the cosmological constant, but also the ages of other objects signaled trouble for energy-free space.</P>

<P>In 1991, Schneider had measured quasar redshifts as high as 4.89. They are now at z = 5.8. This
indicates an even greater age of the universe, since 'lookback time' is a function of redshift, and
without the 'white whale' there isn't enough time since the Big Bang to look back to earlier quasar
epochs. That large a redshift  implies  a matter density &lt; 0.01 critical density without a cosmological
constant. Since 0.1 had already been observed, there was a definite hint of energy in space.</P>

<P>   Recently galaxies older than 13 billion years (in cosmological constant-free time) have been found 
by UC Santa Cruz researchers headed by Sandy Faber--working with the Keck telescope.  These also
exceed the Wendy Freedman age of 12 billion years maximum (without ).</P>

<P>   The ages of the oldest globular stellar clusters given by Alan Sandage, Hubble's successor at the
Mt. Wilson Observatory, are 15-18 Billion years. If this range holds up to scrutiny, this lends
compelling evidence to a cosmic constant, perhaps not as compellingly if we believe Alan's much
lower value for the Hubble Constant. (Remember that  Hubble time is the inverse of H<SUB>o.</SUB>) </P>

<P>   The accuracy of age results is only half as good as the accuracy to which the distance is known. 
 Thus, for example, a Freedman accuracy of 7% for the Hubble constant and distances implies a
14% age uncertainty for ages of globular cluster around somewhat distant galaxies.</P>

<P>   Heavy elements, not found in globular clusters, but in spiral galaxy disks provide a very certain
lower limit for universal age. The oldest heavy elements we find in the  universe are at least 9.6
billion year old.  However, that does leave room for the Freedman results without .</P>

<P>   Galaxy counts at various epochs could pin down a value for the cosmological constant, if there
weren't such strong evidence for galactic evolution. In fact, there seems to be a strong
anticorrelation between galaxy redshift and surface brightness. Though galactic evolution might
eventually accounted for, it is by no means evident how to do that now. </P>

<P>  One might hope that the clustering of galaxies might be disturbed by the cosmic repulsive force,
but  as Martel and Wasserman showed in 1990, such structures would be insensitive to &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>. </P>

<P>  Michael Turner, from the University of Chicago, however, early in the '90s, indicated that a
cosmological constant might be a way  of saving the CDM (cold, dark matter) theory, which seemed
to work well to produce the right-sized lumps for galaxies and clusters. This seems to indicate a
matter density = 0.2 critical density.  Since  recent measurements in 1999 of the microwave
background seem to point to a flat universe with &Omega;<SUB>tot</SUB>=1, this means that the cosmological constant
in such a theory must provide about 80% of the total density. Such a result is very close to the
independent determinations from recent supernovae investigations. However, much refinement of
the CDM hypothesis is needed. Turner remained as the outstanding champion, however, of a
cosmological constant throughout the '90s period preceding the supernova discovery in 1998.</P>

<P>   From 1995 to 1997 work was done by several groups on the mass, light, x-ray emission, motions,
and numbers of galaxies in galactic clusters. The conclusions seemed to center around a value of </P>

<P>&Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.2. Thus, again, the cosmological constant (or some other component) was concluded to
provide the other 80% required for a flat, inflationary universe.</P>

<P>   At the moment, quasar gravitational lensing is perhaps the best alternative to supernovae studies
for determining a cosmological constant. Light from QSO's bending around massive galaxies
creates multiple image effects.  The statistics of the numbers of such observations versus redshift
is sensitive to 'funny energy' in space.  In 1996 Kochanek found a limit of vacuum energy density
&lt; 0.66 critical density for a flat universe.</P>

<P>   We have focused on a cosmological constant, in part, because it is the simplest explanation for
the observed dynamics. To have a component behave any other way would violate the General
Theory of Relativity. However, it is not out the realm of possibility that we are missing the right
theory.  Consequently, there have been a number of time-varying cosmological constant theories,
and superstring or exotic object hypotheses, some of which still match the ten parameter model.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Quantum theory alone is not sufficient to justify a contribution to an accelerating universe by a
well-determined cosmological constant or some other manifestation. The first strike quantum field
theory calculation was off by a factor of 10 to the 120<SUP>th</SUP> power. Also, General Relativity alone allows
for a cosmological constant, but does not give a way of finding its value. We must navigate into the
'final  waters' of quantum gravity to find the 'beast'.</P>

<P>    Before the nineties, when few 'whalers' believed the constant was non-zero, there were many
attempts to prove that the constant was exactly zero. Some of the more widely-touted ones utilized
the phenomenon of wormholes. </P>

<P>    Formerly called 'the Einstein-Rosen Bridge', the wormhole was conceived to be a black hole
connected to a white hole by a 'tube' out of space and time and back again. A black hole is like a
one-way membrane allowing matter and energy to leave the universe and not enter it. A white hole
is the theoretical opposite: if you took a movie of a black hole and played it backward, stuff would
enter the universe unexpectedly. The white hole is a one way membrane <U>into</U> the universe. Both are
singularities in space-time involving a large concentrated mass in Einstein's General Theory. </P>

<P>   Einstein and Rosen showed that wormholes or connecting tubes between different locations on
the spacetime 'surface' were allowed if the universe is closed.  One way of thinking of a closed
universe is to think of a sphere like a balloon. Although the dimensionality is lower by one than the
actual closed universe, one can picture hollow cup handle-like objects connecting to its surface, and
get a  picture of the geometry. </P>

<P>   Amazingly, quantum gravity theorists asserted that there may be many closed universes connected
by these wormhole tubes. Each would have a different set of physical laws determined by quantum 
probability. Some even asserted that one universe could 'give birth' to another-With an umbilical
cord 'wormhole' connecting the two.</P>

<P>   If one imagines large spherical universes like balloons in space with any reasonable number of
tubes connecting them, and cup handles tacked on to individual 'balloons' in random places, one
gets the idea of the construction Coleman used in 1988 to 'prove' that the cosmological constant
was zero. This was a heralded achievement in physics, as the physicists--'inner space'
scientists-believed it only could be very large or zero.</P>

<P>  Though Coleman's work now looks to be wrong in several ways, his technique is illustrative of an
approach to quantum gravity due to DeWitt and Hawking.  They utilized a method of calculation
invented by Richard Feyman in the late '40's. This is the path integral technique. It is best illustrated
for a single free particle. A particle, according to Feynman, may take any possible path in getting
from one place to another. Each has a probability. However, one path is 'stationary' or most
probable.</P>

<P>   In the same way, the universe, DeWitt claimed, could produce any geometry of space-time
allowed by the General Theory of Relativity.  Each had a probability, and one particular type might
be stationary or 'preferred'.  </P>

<P>   When Coleman did his calculation, he found that  &Lambda;= 0 was preferred. This calculation is very
difficult and must be accomplished by making time imaginary. This is Hawking's Euclidean analytic
extension of space-time. Though many have been critical of Coleman's calculation, it represents a
milestone in ways of thinking about quantum gravity.    </P>

<P>    Another interesting idea is the Anthropic Principle. This idea, simplistically, is that the universe
must contrive to have its constants and physical laws such that it will evolve conscious beings to
observe it.  Physical constants must have 'friendly values'. Weinberg argued in 1989 that the limit 
on the cosmological constant necessary for intelligent life was close to the observational limit at the
time. This argument, then, is still valid since the discovered value for  is below that limit.</P>

<P>    There have also been not a few astronomer types who have suggested a time varying cosmological
constant, Philip Peebles and Geoffrey Burbidge among them. Primordial inflationary theories have
such an epoch as the universe slow rolls down the potential hill to a more sedate expansion.
However, many of these theories run into conflict with cosmological nucleo-synthesis (making up
of the elements) and  observations of the cosmic microwave background. There have been
arguments to attempt to circumvent these difficulties, however.</P>

<P>   Supersymmetry and superstring theories-our best hopes at a true quantum gravity--may someday
confirm the existence of a cosmological constant and its size, or lead us to an understanding of some
other component of the 'funny energy' which makes the universe presently accelerate its expansion.</P>

<P>Much work is underway in these directions.</P>

<P>   One can classify the different alternatives to a cosmological constant by using a simple ratio which
expresses the equation of state of that component of the universe. The constant  &alpha;= P/&rho expresses
the proportionality of the pressure, P, of a universal dynamical component to its energy density.

<P>   Here are some examples of that constant for different types of universal 'stuff'. You might say that </P>

<P> represents the behavior of the material in universal expansion.  Matter density has  &alpha;= 0.  This just
means that matter (baryons, neutrinos, and dark matter) has no pressure. For radiation (light)   &alpha;=1/3. </P>

<P>The curvature of the universe has   &alpha;= -1/3.  We expect that neither of these last two contributes
significantly to universal expansion at present.</P>

<P>    There are, however, other less conventional possibilities. The cosmological constant weighs in
with    &alpha; = -1.  You'll recall that it creates a negative pressure on the universe-it pushes out. Vilenkin,
Spergel, and Pen calculated that certain types of networks of cosmic strings would have an effective     &alpha;= -1/3. Cosmic strings are like stringy fractures in the fabric of space-time coming from certain
string theories in quantum gravity. Domain walls-the edges of a pocket universe-if they come in
a network would have   &alpha;= -2/3, according to earlier work by Vilenkin. There is even speculation of
the existence of variable mass particles (VAMPs) which would redshift at a slower rate than
ordinary matter. They would have an  &lt; 0.  The unknown accelerating component was dubbed
'quintessence' by Caldwell , et. al., in 1998, perhaps a better term than 'funny energy', or the recent
'dark energy', since it may not be energy in the ordinary sense. However, the word 'quintessence'
has now become  more specifically assigned to a time varying component of spatial energy density,
a time-varying cosmological 'constant' if you will.</P>

<P>   Garnavich and his team published their analysis of the recent supernova data in December of 1998
and concluded that the quintessential  &alpha; is bounded below by -1 and above by about -0.4, and the
bounds have been narrowed more since. This weakly rules out a lot of possibilities, but more work
needs to be done to narrow the scope.</P>

<P>    Most researchers will probably go with the cosmological constant, as it can be represented within
the General Theory of Relativity itself without recourse to the sketchier quantum field theory. This 
is with the reservation that several types of 'stuff' may contribute. </P>

<P>   For a time reason (Starbuck) seemed poised to overcome obsession (Ahab). There was a long
period when it was unreasonable to pursue a cosmological constant or any type of 'quintessence'
in space. However, haunting peripheral evidence in the '90s, like mutterings from the subconscious,
stopped the 'reasonable' rejection of 'Einstein's greatest blunder'.</P>

<P>   First, the extra matter density needed to satisfy inflationary demands was not found.  In fact only
about 30% of critical density was accounted for--in terms of its influence on the dynamics of
galaxies, clusters, and superclusters. The only possibility was some component of dark matter
between the superclusters, and it became apparent that such a component was extremely unlikely.
Modeling the clumping of matter with cold dark matter or even a mix with some hot dark matter
did not seem compatible with a higher matter density in the voids.</P>

<P>    Second, gravitational lensing was yielding a weak indication of a cosmological constant
somewhere between 0.2 and 0.7 of critical density. At that juncture, even the coordinator of
inflationary enthusiasts, Michael Turner from the University of Chicago, was beginning to include
a cosmological constant in his thinking, leaving open the possibility that another dark matter
component's traces might still be hidden.</P>

<P>   Meanwhile, paralleling these developments was a great stream of advance in technology. It would
lead to accurate determinations of the nature of Hubble's law out to a distance adequate to
determine how the universe had expanded in the past. </P>

<P>  Richard Mueller from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) worked with Luis Alvarez in
discovering the reason for the extinction of the dinosaurs-a cataclysmic impact by an asteroidal
body.  In addition, he set out to find the cause of the 26 million year periodic extinction of earth
species. He suspected this to be a brown dwarf or 'failed' star called Nemesis with a 26 million year
orbital period. He hypothesized that once every orbit it swung near the earth in its elongated
elliptical orbit, catapulting debris from the Oort cloud and asteroid belt toward our home. </P>

<P>   To see if he could find 'Nemesis', he needed to scan large regions of sky intelligently. To do this
he masterminded robotic control of a telescope, and software analysis of its data. The program was
able to compare a given region of the sky at two widely separated times, to see if a moving 'star'
could be found.</P>

<P> Mueller soon realized that the technique could be easily applied to finding exploding
stars-supernovae-in distant galaxies. He could store observations of many galaxies at one time, and
then at a later date compare observations of the same patches of sky. If a bright object appeared, it
could be investigated as a possible supernova. In fact, the light from one observation could be
subtracted from the other, leaving only the bright exploding stars. Their spectra and other
characteristics of these potential supernovae then had to be carefully analyzed to be sure they
weren't other objects.</P>

<P>   In the mid '80s, Saul Perlmutter joined Mueller's supernova group at LBL. Perlmutter, as an
undergrad at Harvard, chose physics over philosophy, and went on to study particle physics at
Berkeley. He was later to head up the 'Supernova Cosmology Group', which first gathered a
preponderance of evidence to pin down the universal acceleration. Before he joined, the group was
already successfully identifying supernovae in galaxies at moderate distances.</P>

<P>   Several dozen supernovae were identified by 1989. However, these were not at great enough a
distance find out whether the universe was accelerating or decelerating. Besides, the issue of
distances to supernovae was not well resolved at the time. However, A certain type of
supernova-supernova Ia-was identified as a possible candidate for being a 'standard candle'. </P>

<P>   Recognizing a 'standard candle' is like knowing a lightbulb is always 100 watts, no matter how
far away it is. Light falls off as the square of the distance, so one could find the distance to the
lightbulb by using a lightmeter to measure the light received at the observer.</P>

<P>   Similarly, since Supernovae Ia all seemed <U>nearly</U> the same source wattage (luminosity) at the peak
of their explosion, they agreed they should be able to use them as standard candles, or distance
markers, by how bright they appeared in their telescopes.</P>

<P>   A star goes supernovae Ia when matter from a red giant companion is drawn onto the surface of
a white dwarf.  When the total mass of the dwarf reaches 1.4 times the mass of the sun, a peculiar
thing happens. The dwarf gets hot enough to start burning the carbon of which it is made, rapidly
fusing it to heavier elements, but only in a small portion of the star. </P>

<P>   It's sort of like an atom bomb triggering a hydrogen bomb explosion, however, because once the
burning starts, it spreads to the whole star.  The idea is that the total burning of a white dwarf of 1.4
solar masses will produce an explosion of a predictable peak luminosity or brightness.</P>

<P>   To understand a supernova, one must not only look at its spectrum but at it's 'light curve'. The
'light curve' is a plot of received light flux from the star versus time. A supernova typically
brightens </P>

<P>to a peak luminosity in a few days, and then gradually tapers down over a period of several weeks.</P>

<P>It's much like climbing a mountain with a steep incline on the near side, but a more gradual descent
on the far side.</P>

<P>  The problem with identifying Ia's as standard candles, however, was that the 'mountains' of
apparent brightness were not always of exactly the same slopes, and therefore might not have the
same peak luminosities.  However, in 1993, an American astronomer named Mark Philips, working
in Chile,  showed that their peak luminosities were correlated with the rate of descent of flux. That's
like saying:  the steeper the descent, the taller the mountain. And, by noting how fast the flux from
the exploding star trailed off, one could find the value of its standard candle luminosity at the peak.</P>

<P>   This was very exciting, because it meant that hope was raised for finding precise distances to more
and more distant galaxies, as telescopes improved their reach.  In 1988, Danish astronomers found
the first distant supernova Ia at a redshift of z = 0.32.  </P>

<P>   In the '90s, more were being discovered by Permutter's team with each observation. The Hubble
Space telescope was in the sky, and it was gradually realized that supernova standard candles were
a key to the unfoldment of a deeper knowledge of cosmology.</P>

<P>   As supernovae Ia were discovered at greater and greater distances, astronomers could use their
luminosities to get their distances, and the redshifts of spectral lines to get the recession velocities
of the associated galaxies. An extension of the Hubble law plot seemed feasible. With much
difficulty, Perlmutter's group and a second major supernova group were able to get Hubble
telescope time.</P>

<P>    It became a competition and cooperation between the two coasts of the USA, one group centered
(at first) on Harvard and the other centered on UC Berkeley.  The Harvard group was spearheaded
by Robert Kirschner (a student of Fritz Zwicky-the dark matter man), who early recognized the
significance of Supernova Ia:  that they could lead us out of 'age of ignorance' in cosmology.  He
collaborated with Brian Schmidt, who soon moved to Australia to be with his wife. </P>

<P>   Schmidt became head of the 'Harvard-spawned' endeavor.  They called themselves the 'High z

many of whom started at Harvard.  Particularly notable were Adam Riess, who was able distort
supernova Ia light curves to make standard peak luminosities realizable, and Alex Filiippenko, who
became a renown observer, teacher, and pioneer supernova researcher.  Both of these 'Harvard' boys
moved to Berkeley, blurring the lines bounding the two groups geographically.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<P><STRONG>'High-Z Supernova Search Team' (24 members) </STRONG><EM>'Harvard Initiated'</EM><STRONG> </STRONG>: Robert Kirshner (initiator), 
Brian Schmidt (head), Pete Garnavich (Harvard-Smithsonian), Mark Phillips (standard candle

a worldwide team. Their first important release in 1998 included the data for <U>14 high-z Supernovae
Ia</U>.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   What did the combined 1998 data for 56 high-z supernova Ia's show?  To understand this, we must understand the goals of cosmology in 1998. By the way, the current number is above 80, with quite
a few at greater distance than the original batch. </P>

<P>   The fondest hope of the researchers was to reach closer to the dream of pinning down <SUB>m</SUB> the
matter density for the universe.  Along with this was the enigma of <SUB></SUB>, related to the cosmological
constant. Was it zero, as physicists and most astronomers had asserted for decades? If not, what
could it be?  There was a surprisingly precise answer to both these questions, though we will see it
could not be fully accomplished by supernova observations alone. It required detailed observations
of the lumps in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We will discuss the impact of recent
observations of the CMB after we address the  'Supernova Revolution'.</P>

<P>   The Supernova Ia observations for close range detections in the late nineties were shaping up a
value for the Hubble Constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>. The procedure was simple in concept, challenging in practice.
Redshifts of spectral lines provided recession velocities for relatively nearby SN Ia's, and peak
luminosity standard candles provided distances. A plot of recession velocity versus distance for
nearby supernovae yields a straight line. The slope of the line is the Hubble constant. It took some
time for the supernova Hubble constant to reasonably agree with that derived from the Cepheid
variable data, but by 1998, they both converged to a range of about 65-70 km/s/Mpc.</P>

<P>   The Hubble constant gives the current rate of expansion of the universe, but reveals nothing of
how the universe was expanding in the past. To do that with supernovae, required extending the
observation to larger 'cosmological' redshifts of 0.3-0.7.  This was the great work the two supernova
groups accomplished. The mass of data, gathered and analyzed by two separate scientific groups in
slightly different ways was very convincing. Although the error bars in luminosity-determined
distance were large for each supernova, larger amounts of data shrunk the uncertainty in the overall
determination. </P>

<P>  Also significant were the corrections that were used to gradually shrink the uncertainty of
individual measurements. Trumpler, in the 30's, had demonstrated a correlation between the
reddening of light passing through dust and overall extinction of that light. Thus ordinary dust was
mathematically accommodated as a factor in changing the apparent brightness of supernovae.  Some
astronomers wonder, however, if there might be a form of large dust particles called 'grey dust'
which would make the results far from reliable. Grey dust, if it exists, would absorb without
reddening. Therefore its effect would not be easily corrected for. Nevertheless, recent studies make
it clear that this is a very unlikely possibility.</P>

<P>     After almost two years--as of this writing--the data seems to stand, and is being extended to many
more Supernovae. The stretch factor and light curve form corrections from Mark Philips and Adam
Riess yielded almost identical light curves for all supernova Ia. The question is whether supernovae
at low z are the same in content and thus luminosity as those of mid-range z. Could white dwarfs
have had lower metallicities or different structures in the past, and thus explode with a different
bang?  It's sort of like comparing how they made firecrackers in my youth to how they are made
today.  They sound the same, but were they made the same? This question also seems, for
supernovae Ia, to be answered in the almost certain affirmative.</P>

<P>   Just as Captain Ahab questioned the observations of passing ships that had seen the white whale,
so are these revolutionary conclusions being questioned.  However, time seems to confirm the
uncanny picture they present. Additional information from gravitational lensing and the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) confirms the existence of a cosmological constant-like component
to space itself.</P>

<P>  What exactly did the supernova data give us?  High-z supernova velocities and distances show that 
the Hubble curve deviates from a straight line at about z = 0.3 and beyond.  If it had maintained a
straight line at great distances, there would be no effect related to the matter in the universe. It was
expected by many astronomers that the curve of v versus d should have bent upward, proving the
decelerating influence of the gravity of the matter in the universe.</P>

<P>   However, the Hubble curve (in the v versus d form) turned decisively down instead, indicating that
the universe has accelerated.  We know his was true for the brief instant of rapid expansion in the
inflationary theory.  But to assert that this was true for billions of years after that was revolutionary. 
The data was so good, in fact, that they asserted it to be 99% certain the universe will expand
forever. Thus were wiped out the dreams of those  who believed the cosmos underwent a cyclic
expansion and collapse. </P>

<P>     The balance of matter and cosmological constant 'funny energy' was also narrowed in scope by
these observations. The way the Hubble curve turns down is related to the difference of  &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>and &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>.
In fact, the combined supernova data indicate the &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>- &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> = -0.4 (within about 0.1).  This is like
having an equation in algebra, where x - y = 5. One immediately craves another independent
equation like x + y = 8 to determine what x and y are.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   The big news of the year 2000 in astronomy is a clear picture of a hump that has given us an
accurate value for the total density of the universe including cosmological constant. (In astronomy,
'accurate' usually means less than 10% uncertainty.) We have sighted the 'white whale' in the year
2000. Its 'hump' is a lump typically found in the latest detailed measurements of the Cosmic
Microwave Background map of the sky.      </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   I had a friend in New York City in the '70s, a rather large man, who fancied himself a sea captain,though he was not. One day we went to the somewhat crowded beach at Coney island, he sporting
a captain's cap and me my Neil Young folksinger haircut.  He instructed me to walk a good distance
on the beach away from him and be ready to respond with a certain phrase to his predetermined
query.  I walked several hundred yard distance and waited for his shout.</P>

<P>   "Have you seen the white whale?" he bellowed.</P>

<P>   I waited a couple seconds and replied in my loudest, most sea-worthy voice.  </P>

<P>   "Yes! We've slain him yesterday."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   The cosmic microwave background with its second harpoon has almost certainly 'slain' the white
whale. What have our balloon-borne observations shown?  The universe is flat.  It's sort of
anticlimactic, like a beer drinker's pronunciation on opening a can left in the refrigerator for years.
The beer is flat.  'I could have told you so', you say.  The 'inner space' contingent of particle
physicists who live and breathe inflation could have told us the universe was flat.</P>

<P>    Inflation, at least the type invented by Guth, and perpetuated by generations of physicists gone
astronomers, requires that the universe currently be flat. This is the other equation we need to get
matter and space densities separately:  &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>+ &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> = 1. However, before the observations reported by
the MAXIMA and BOOMERanG groups April 27 and  May 10, 2000, it had not been nearly as
certain that they were right.</P>

<P>    Let's assume that these observations are correct, use them to solve our set of two equations, two
unknowns, and then talk about the reasons we strongly believe in flatness.</P>

<P>   Let x = &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>, and y = &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>.  The two equations then become:</P>

<P> </P>

<P>                                          x - y = 0.4       (Supernova Ia observations),</P>

<P>                                         x + y = 1.0       (CMB observations).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   You may check that the solutions are x = 0.3 and y = 0.7.   Translated, &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>= 0.3 and  &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> = 0.7
(within about 0.1, it turns out).  That is, matter currently makes up about 30% of critical density and
'funny energy' 70%. Note that these are the values of these parameters for the current epoch. 
Earlier in the universe, both the relative matter density and relative cosmological constant density
were different than they are today. The matter density was much larger and  the relative space
density much smaller (that is, if we go for the standard interpretation of a cosmological <U>constant</U>). </P>

<P>   This is a subtle matter which may be confusing for beginning cosmology students.  Remember that
the omegas (&Omega; with a subscript) are the true densities divided by the critical density at the epoch. 
That critical density varies with time. What makes the universe flat now is not what made it flat in
the past.  This makes &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> vary with time, though the cosmological constant density does not.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   Now, as to the reasons the Cosmic Background measurements indicate a flat universe.  The sum 
of the matter and energy in the universe is what decides curvature in Einstein's General Theory of
relativity. Curvature determines the movement of matter. It is only natural then that &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>+ &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>, the
sum of the matter and energy components that contribute to curvature, can be determined by looking
at the lumpiness of the microwave background.  </P>

<P>   About 300,000 years after the big bang, there was finally enough space between protons and
electrons so that the light in the universe was free to propagate without interacting with them.
Before this time, when an electron and proton would combine to make a hydrogen atom, a photon
would come along and liberate the electron. The end of this era  is called the recombination era,
then, because the electrons  were finally free to combine to make lasting electrically neutral
hydrogen.</P>

<P>   In the process of electrons falling in to the electric grasp of a proton and making hydrogen, 
ultraviolet photons were released with 13.6 electron volts of energy. The stretching of space in the
expanding universe also expanded the wavelength of these photons until they are currently
microwaves with a much lower energy.  </P>

<P>    Since the moment of recombination was the last time the light in the universe was in equilibrium, having a common temperature and a Planck or black body curve, the black body distribution of light
centered on ultra violet was later shifted to a lower temperature. The Wien peak of this curve is
theoretically and observationally associated with a black body at 2.7 <SUP>o </SUP>K.</P>

<P>   This was discovered by Penzias and Wilson at Bell Labs in the 60's. However, in about 1990, the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) group from Berkeley was able to see that the Microwave
Background was lumpy, varying in temperature by about 1 part in 100,000 in lumps of random sizes.
This seemed to confirm a lumpiness at the time of Recombination which could produce the matter
structures we see today. </P>

<P>   This lumpiness was good enough to see a spectrum of sizes from the end of the inflationary period
much prior to Recombination. However, the detail was not good enough to see even smaller lumps
which could determine the curvature of the universe, and which had occurred as a natural result of
Recombination.  </P>

<P>    The discovery of the largest of these lumps, like the appearance of the hump of Moby Dick when
he surfaced, created quite a stir among the crew of the ship of cosmology. This lump relates to the
size of the 'last scattering volume' at the time of decoupling (recombination). </P>

<P>   Before decoupling, the density of light generally bounced of protons and electrons, keeping the
whole gas in equilibrium at a common temperature. The matter and radiation thus maintain
homogeneity or smoothness, but only within a volume the size that light could travel in the time
from the big bang to the recombination era.  Light could not communicate with regions larger than
that.</P>

<P>   How big this original lump is now depends on the curvature of space, &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>+ &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>,  because the
curvature determines the rate of expansion of space and thus the Microwave Background lumps. </P>

<P>   A lump is measured by a small local increase of temperature. The largest variations are tiny: not
over 50 millionths of a Kelvin degree.  Consequently, early measurements had large error bars,
because the lumps were very small.  </P>

<P>   However, the measurements released in mid-year 2000, had improved enough to definitely see the
'a big lump' the size of the expanded last scattering surface. They were just the right angular sizeto confirm within about 10% that &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>+ &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> = 1.  The universe is flat.  <SUB>  </SUB></P>

<P>   How does one make generalization about the sizes of lumps, when we see so many of different
sizes? The answer is a process called multipole expansion. Each multipole is labeled by the letter,
L = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (I use a capital L so it can be understood in print, but researchers use a lower case).</P>

<P>   In the 1800's, the mathematician Legendre pioneered the angular decomposition of any function 
in space, utilizing the Legendre Polynomials. In our case, we wish to analyze the surface of a sphere
(or part of one) over which the variations of CMB temperature are plotted. Each increase in L
divides each previous sector of the sphere in 2.</P>

<P>   L = 1 is called the monopole term.  It represents a lump the size of the whole sky.</P>

<P>   L = 2 is the dipole term.  Divide the sphere in two, and find the temperature difference between
the two hemispheres. The COBE satellite was able to find that we were moving in the direction of
one hemisphere at a rate of 550 km/s, because of a slight temperature difference between on
direction and the opposite. This is our motion in the Milky Way relative to the 'comoving'
expanding universe.</P>

<P>   L = 3 is the quadrupole term.  The sphere is divided in 4 pieces.</P>

<P>   The number of pieces is thus 2<SUP>L-1</SUP>.  </P>

<P>   Thus L = 4 is the octopole term, dividing the sphere in 8 pieces.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   The key term for the biggest lump should be about L = 210, if the universe is flat.  This
corresponds to a lump about 9/10ths a degree across. The BOOMERanG group found it to be L =
200, and the MAXIMA balloon-borne experiment was in close agreement at L = 220. This produces
an combined uncertainty in &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>+ &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> = 1 of about 9%.  </P>

<P>    In addition, the height of the first lump in temperature difference can directly give <SUB>m</SUB>, the density
of matter in the universe. I have not seen figures on this determination, but it should be somewhat
ill-determined, until the MAP (Microwave Anisotropy Project) satellite does its work while orbiting
the sun in the next few years. This means we are just a few years away from fairly precise values
(within about 3%) of &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>and &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>, the matter and dark energy  components of the universe. If these
values harmonize with the supernova data, they will be mutually confirming. Thank you Penzias and
Wilson!</P>

<P>   There is one 'fly in the ointment', however. Smaller peaks at predicted values of higher L are
expected if we believe the inflationary theorists. Preliminary data from the BOOMERanG projects
shows they are not being found as expected. These peaks are like higher harmonics from the
vibration of the last scattering surface.  Perhaps we will have to change the standard inflation
scenario, or perhaps the supernova observations are wrong, or...  perhaps the cosmological
'constant' is not constant.</P>

<P>    The last possibility is the quintessence idea and most cosmologists believe it requires abandoning
Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. However, as indicated in the next chapter, there is one
outside  possibility.</P>

<P>   Though the present data work harmoniously with the idea of a cosmological constant, life for
future  cosmologists may not be that simple. Pinning down the matter density and the space energy
density at present doesn't necessarily reveal what it was in the distant past.  We have only seen part of the
whale, so to speak.  Though it may be the main goal of cosmology, the dynamics of the universe
from beginning to end has not been revealed yet.</P>

<P>   One possibility is that there are more than two contributions to universal curvature. Perhaps we
will need matter,  the cosmological constant, and something else to explain future supernova data.
However, adding extra components to the equation is hardly in obedience to Occam's razor-the
maxim that simpler is better. The search for SN Ia objects at higher z is going on as I write. The
announcements prior to December 1998 included supernovae only up to about  z = 0.7. However,
the current record holder is Albinoni at z = 1.2, exploding at an amazing 10 Billion years in the past.
By the way, the record holder for distance for all types of objects as of April 2000 was a quasar with
redshift of 5.8, which is seen gushing at 13-14 billion years ago.</P>

<P>   How will we know when we have the right understanding of the movement of the cosmos? When
we have a fundamental theory which describes the velocities we see at various all distances, and the
ripples we see in the CMB.  The simplest hypothesis is that there is a single component additional
to matter. Cosmologists usually assume a simple equation of state: that the pressure of the
component is proportional to density. We call the proportionality constant , the 'equation of state
parameter'.</P>

<P>As indicated in a previous chapter, different types of 'stuff' have different . </P>

<P>   Over 10 years ago,  the term 'quintessence' was applied to dark matter in clusters and galaxies. 
Lawrence Krauss from  Case Western Reserve was thinking of the 5 elements of the Greeks: earth,
air, fire, water, and  the fifth-ether, or quintessence.</P>

<P>   However, his appellation didn't stick. </P>

<P>   The general consensus among cosmologists is the following:</P>

<P>1. Earth-baryonic or nuclear matter, made of protons and neutrons (baryons).</P>

<P>2. Air-hot dark matter, smaller particles with large velocities.</P>

<P>3. Water--cold dark matter of the non-baryonic type.  Slower moving particles, which are not
baryons. </P>

<P>4.  Fire-photons or light.</P>

<P>5.  Quintessence-anything else.  At first this term was applied to the cosmological constant as well, but Caldwell and Steinhardt from the University of Pennsylvania (author of the 'new inflation') 
      have limited the word to a time-varying cosmological component.  This component is not any
of       the above,  nor is it a cosmological constant.</P>

<P>   We are looking for a fundamental theory to describe the motion of the universe from beginning
to  end.  Most astronomers, but not all, accept that there was probably a brief period of inflation, a
rapid expansion for a fraction of a second, which ended.  However, as we have pointed out, we do
not  have a fundamental theory which exactly fits the numbers we need to produce not only
inflation, but the lumpiness we need to produce the matter aggregations we see today as a result of
it. For lack of a deeper theory,  particle physicists invoke the unexplained 'inflaton field'. The
universal marble had to roll very slowly down the hill-too slowly for any of our current particle
theories to produce such a roll.</P>

<P>   We also know a great deal about the dynamics of our universe as far back as 7 billion years into
the past.  However, very little is known about universal movement in between inflation and then,
and so a truly fundamental  theory of the whole 'she-bang' is out of our grasp, <U>at the moment</U>.</P>

<P>   We don't know for sure that we need one, but let's explore the possibility of a time-varying
cosmological 'constant', in hopes that if we do need one, we will have some thought-out scenarios
to choose from.</P>

<P>   The first public appearance of a reasonable time-varying quintessence was the theory of Philip
Peebles and Bharat Ratra in 1988. I had mentioned an 'unreasonable' time-varying theory to Peebles
in 1985, but I'll get into that deeper later. Being a grad student, and not seeing any time variable
theories in print, I thought I had staked claim to the territory, and I was a little chagrined that
Peebles and Ratra beat me to the publication draw.</P>

<P>   However, their theory harmonized with the usual inflationary scenario (I thought mine didn't). It
related to the potential energy hill of inflation (the slope of the Mexican hat) caused by  what is
called  a 'scalar quantum field'. The kinetic energy from coming down the main part of the hill in
inflation is thought to have fed into making the matter we know and love today. </P>

<P>   The hill, they speculated, however, might have a 'foothill'. They gave it the simplest form
possible, calling it a 'power law tail'.  This tail meant that the energy in the vacuum would gradually
decrease like a time-decreasing cosmological constant. Such a tail might give a fundamental reason
why the  present cosmological constant is about the same magnitude as normal matter density, a
seeming coincidence. One form of the model also allows for &Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.3 in a flat universe, so it is still
in the running.</P>

<P>   Several forms for quintessence have been ruled out to a high degree of certainty by the supernova
Ia observations. The Perlmutter group results limit the equation of state parameter to  &lt; -0.6 with
95% certainty.  This completely eliminates the network of cosmic string theory of Vilenkin, Spergel,
and Pen at   &alpha;= -1/3.  Vilenkin's comoving domain walls (a bubbly universe), is still an unlikely
possibility at  &alpha;= - 2/3, while the 'globally wound texture' theory of Davis, Kamionkowski,  and

<P>   J. M Overdun, form the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada would have us believe it
possible that our universe is the result of a previous universe having met its 'Waterloo'. He pointed
out in May, 1999 that some time-variable quintessence theories allow an avoidance of the big bang,
instead allowing for a 'big  bounce'.  </P>

<P>   This simply means the universe could have originated from a finite size rather than a cosmic
'point' or singularity.  It's called a 'bounce' because a big crunch or collapsing phase could have
preceded the expanding phase. One of these possibilities has the cosmological constant scaling as
the square of the Hubble Constant for its epoch.  This  H<SUP>2 </SUP>model, promoted by Carvalho, Lima,
and Waga, predicts that if &Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>= 0.3, &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> should be 0.7.  This is a nice fit to the currently held balance
of matter and space energy.</P>

<P>   The inflationary theory itself has postulated a slow-rolling decreasing vacuum energy or time
varying cosmological 'constant'. All the time-varying 'funny energy' theories I have seen describe
a change in the same direction.  An originally high vacuum energy decreases to the small present
value.</P>

<P>   However, back in 1985, I talked with Philip Peebles (same initials as mine) about another
possibility, which requires an <U>increasing</U> cosmological constant. Increasing, in fact, from a negative
value and becoming asymptotic to a value equal to the total curvature of the universe.  Eventually,
in this theory, the present value of the 'funny energy' density would become equal to the total energy
density of the universe at present.  </P>

<P>    The theory, in 1985, was too speculative to be published. Most astronomers didn't recognize any
need for a cosmological constant. Philip Peebles was a major exception. Thus he was receptive to
my suggestion, but added that it would need more proof. It still does--in fact, any quintessence
theory does--but there are some signs that it is still very much in the running.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Explanations for Saint Elmo's Fire--conservation:  the energy of space and matter</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   The hypotheses of my theory are three. </P>
<BR>
<P>1) <U>The energy of matter plus the energy of vacuum is conserved</U>. This was first proposed by Andrei Linde from the former Soviet Union and was the first glimpse of Guth's full blown inflationary theory. Linde came oh so close to beating Guth to the punch. In Linde's theory, a type of Grand
Unified particle field (a scalar field, or the simplest particle field) is invested in what is called a
Bose Einstein condensate.  This is like a different phase of matter that behaves like space.  While
it is in this condensate phase the entire conglomerate of particles acts like a single particle and space
has a funny energy, a cosmological constant.  Its internal energy is given up as it 'evaporates'. This
energy forms particles. Linde's theory was an attempt to explain the appearance of matter from
empty space. Had he applied it to the expanding universe, he would have discovered inflation first.</P>

<BR WP="BR1">
<P>2) <U>The universe is homogeneous</U>. As explored earlier in the book, this seems to be reasonably
confirmed by large scale observations of large portions of the universe, and is used in a basic
assumption in most cosmological theories.</P>

<BR WP="BR1">
<P>So far, no surprises. No physicist or cosmologist would complain.</P>

<BR WP="BR1">
<P>3) <U>It is not space which is Lorentz invariant, but matter <STRONG>plus</STRONG> space on a coarse scale</U>.  This one will
raise eyebrows. Lorentz invariance of space is the reason most cosmologists will bet on a constant
cosmological constant, one that does not vary with time. It is simply because all experiments we
have done away from intense gravity have confirmed Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. This
theory says that no speed can be added to the speed of light. The mathematical foundation of that
observation  is Lorentz invariance of empty space. </P>

<P>   The unique thing about my theory is that except in the early universe the change in the
cosmological constant is so slow that it appears to be constant, most importantly, in the present. My
time varying , asymptotically rises to a value it is close to now. It would be hard, in the theory, for
us to measure the deviations from Einstein's Special Theory unless we did observations over
thousands, perhaps millions of years.  I am saying the Special Theory might be only  approximate.</P>

<P>   I recall that when a meteorite from Antarctica was  realized to bear possible bacterial fossils from
Mars , the Nasa spokesman said that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof".  We will
see that there are hints of a cosmology which transcends 'common sense'.  However, bear with me
while I develop the theory from my three postulates.</P>

<P>   I call the combination of the three postulates, the Maximal Cosmological Principle (MCP). This
comes from a term Robertson, the theorist who explored the implications of homogeneity and
isotropy in the 20's and 30's. He helped derive the Robertson-Walker Metric for a uniformly
expanding  universe, allowing us to do Cosmology with Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. He
also pointed out that empty space was Maximally symmetric. It could be represented by a
cosmological constant in Einstein's Theory.</P>

<P>   All I am saying that is new is that space may only be approximately maximally symmetric. Rather 
it is space (the vacuum) plus matter which achieves that on the largest scale. This is a theoretically
reasonable statement for the following reason. T. D. Lee, the Nobelist, who along with C. N. Yang 
explored parity violations in particle decay, initiated a paradigm for symmetry breaking. The
concept is that when matter or vacuum break symmetry, the combination does not. Each takes up
the slack for the other in compensation.</P>

<P>   An example is the appearance of matter in the inflationary theory. It seems to come from nothing, to violate energy conservation, but it is simpler to think of its energy as coming from the vacuum.
This is conservation of energy, or time translation symmetry for matter plus vacuum.</P>

<P>   Maximal symmetry is broken by matter which decreases in its mass-energy density as the universe
expands. What I am saying is that the vacuum energy density must increase to compensate, hence
a  time increasing asymptotically-constant .</P>

<P>  The rate of cosmological expansion, the scale factor for the universe is easily derived from this
assumption. Matter plus vacuum behave like a rather small cosmological constant.  This is exactly
what happens in inflation before the 'ball' rolls down the hill. In my 'maximal theory', the universe
expands exponentially, but at a much slower rate than the inflationary theory requires.</P>

<P>   This doesn't mean we must abandon inflation. However, it makes the cosmological arguments for
it unnecessary. I have found the rate of expansion sufficient to solve the flatness, horizon, and
magnetic monopole problems inflationary theories were cooked up to solve. They rely on a
tremendous amount of expansion. It is just accomplished more slowly, over a longer time.</P>

<P>   When I first talked about this with Michael Turner I was a green graduate student who hadn't even
studied the inflationary theory in depth. I knew cosmology only up to that point. He must have
thought me an ignorant fool, since he was the  leader of the inner space inflationary particle
cosmology contingent. However, now what I said makes a lot more sense. At the time, Michael was
adverse to the words 'cosmological constant' for good reason, since there was almost no evidence
with the exception of the lookback time problem. </P>

<P>   In the 90's he began to see that a cosmological constant might be a necessity and learned to
harmonize it with primeval inflation. We may find that even a constant doesn't go far enough.
Quintessence may be required by the data.</P>

<P>    So, what are the successes of Maximal Theory and why is it still in the running?</P>

<P>1.  <U>It obviates the cosmological necessity for primeval inflation</U> (it could put a lot of particle
physicists out of business, if viable).  It explains flatness, horizon, and monopole problems. This
does not mean that primeval, momentary inflation might not be required by some future Grand Unified or String
Theory, etc.</P>

<P>2. The value for <U>the current deceleration parameter is within the limits</U> for the theories prediction:q<SUB>o</SUB>
= -1.  In fact, it remains at -1 throughout history . In the standard cosmology, q<SUB>o</SUB> = (1/2)(&Omega;<SUB>m </SUB>-3 &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB>). 
The current values are &Omega;<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.3 and &Omega;<SUB>&Lambda;</SUB> = 0.7.  If you do the math, the observational value of the
deceleration parameter is q<SUB>o</SUB> = 0.94, with  about 10% uncetainty. If future deep space supernova Ia
observations verify q = -1 at earlier epoch, this will be the only going theory I know of. In fact, I was
gratified when Adam Riess and the High-Supernova Search Team published a value in early 1998 of q<SUB>o</SUB> = -1, even when they had a 40% uncetainty. This uncetainty has been reduced dramatically
since then.</P>

<P>   Such a deceleration parameter was given by Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold for the Steady State Theory
of the 50's. They hypothesized that matter was created to replace the lowering density caused by
expansion-created out of nothing. This kept the matter density constant. Maximal theory argues that
space takes up the slack instead of nothing, keeping the density of the matter plus vacuum constant. 
In a way Maximal Theory is a New Steady State Theory, vacuum-packed for freshness :&gt;).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All fired up to hunt Moby Dick--Andrei Sakharov: is space spongy?</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>  Andrei Sakharov, the imprisoned Soviet dissident, developed the concept of spongy space. He
claimed that compressed space could have a gravitational effect. He was working toward a
fundamental understanding of the cause of gravity. Perhaps matter itself is merely compressed
space. Though no one has been able to complete that idea for an idea, Sakharov's concept may apply
to the detailed workings of Maximal Theory and the Maximal Universe.</P>

<P>    Is there a bulk modulus of compressibility for the cosmological 'constant' vacuum energy? The
interesting thing is that although a cosmological constant force is repulsive because of the implied
negative pressure (outward), it acts on space-time  with an attractive gravitational effect. Thus it
may mean that the cosmological constant is not uniform over space. (Raised your eyebrows yet?) </P>

<P>   This means that empty space might only be locally Lorenz Invariant. Fantasize for a moment. Say
the bulk modulus of space is so large that  the solar system doesn't increase scrunch space enough
for us to measure deviations from Einstein's Special Relativity.  However, one of the quirks of the
Maximal Theory is that space is allowed to violate Lorentz Invariance in space as well as time. It
may become clumpy, but my suggestion is that it happens only on the galactic and galactic cluster
level where the gravity is sufficient to overpower the large bulk modulus and produce local lumps
in the cosmological constant.</P>

<P>    In this way, some of the dynamical dark matter in galaxies and clusters might be explained by
Maximal Theory. One interesting feature is that the bulk modulus required to handle galactic dark
matter would be about the same as that required for cluster dark matter. We can estimate this bulk
modulus, and perhaps work backward toward a quantum theory of the structure of space, just as we
can tell something about atomic structure from the bulk modulus of a solid.  </P>

<P>    Here you may think Dr. Petersen has gone off the deep end. He's trying to explain nearly
everything with one wacko idea. However, who was it that said that ideas in theoretical physics
often don't work because 'they aren't crazy enough'? </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>   What about future tests of Maximal Theory?  I do assume, for simplicity that the universe is flat.
Perhaps primeval inflation will be required to make it so, time may tell.  One area of great
puzzlement is the latest results from the BOOMERanG project measuring the microwave anisotropy,
you know, the L multipole stuff. Though the first Doppler peak caused by temperature variations
the size of the universe at decoupling (recombination era) matches a flat universe, secondary peaks
which are harmonics of the big ripple seem not to be showing up as predicted by standard inflation. </P>

<P>   I am working on calculations for what they would be in my theory. My preliminary thought is that
the damping of a large negative cosmological constant, which would have existed in that era to
balance the large matter density will all but eliminate them. Play a guitar underwater and secondary
overtones will be very faint, even if the fundamental frequency still can be heard.</P>

<P>     One thing that must be noted is that the age of the Maximal universe is infinite.  This displaces
the epoch of recombination in time.  However, it looks as though the Maximal picture produces the
same  temperature for the black body curve produced by combining protons.</P>

<P>    One sore question is primordial nucleosynthesis.  With such a slow early expansion (the negative
cosmological constant acts like retarding matter), will it cook up too many heavier elements?
Perhaps the answer to that is in a deeper understanding of how matter got there in the first place.
Maybe it is a slower process than thought. This fundamental understanding can only come from the
particle physicists, perhaps the string theorists. The 'inner space' perspective  is equal in importance
to the 'outer space' viewpoint, and I must admit to being 'spaced out' most of my life :&gt;).<BR>
   Cosmology is a very exciting field for an Ahab-at-heart like me.  My challenge is keeping my
Starbuck reason close at hand to temper the excitement of the kill which maybe at hand.</P>

me with an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. I have stopped reading those parts of those
books. I say this with a knowledge that my own theory is speculative.</P>

<P>  However, I will restrain my reluctance in the interest of those who do need a summing up.</P>

<P>  The view, held for over 60 years, that space provided no impetus in the cosmic expansion, has
fallen with observations that Supernova Ia to moderate distances indicate the universe is
accelerating. Only  a repulsive force could make it do so. The gravity of matter is attractive.</P>

<P>  Most astronomers now pin the tail on a constant contribution of space we call the cosmological

donkeys  move, albeit ever so slowly. Hence my slow moving adiabatic approach to a constant

primeval acceleration. It may even be a constant acceleration as I predict. My theory is simple in
that respect.</P>

<P>   We also want to try to see those secondary Doppler peaks in the Cosmic Microwave background.
Their strength or absence will tell a big story which might give us a picture more telling than the

<P>   Also, our explorations into 'inner space' may reveal more of the origin of matter in the universe. 
Our accelerators now slam gold atoms together at speeds near the speed of light, producing a state
of matter similar to a fraction of a second after the big bang. Discovery of new particles, particularly
supersymmetric pairs would be useful in piecing together the puzzle. But maybe this will take us
in an entirely new direction. This area of study and superstring theory provide hope for a more
complete understanding.  Particle physicists aren't out of the cosmology running yet.</P>
