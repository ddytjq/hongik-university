1981 Chevy Malibu
<BR>
350 c.i. - Paid $100 - Sold the Mag Rims off the car for $40 - Actual cost of car $60	
<BR>
After rewiring the engine, it ran pretty good.  The car did leak coolant real bad from a bad freeze plug.
<BR>
I got tired of spending so much time and money on one car. In a fit of anger, I ripped out the radiator, hoses, waterpump and alternator. 
<BR>
I ran this  the car without coolant, but will use synthetic oil in the engine.  I had doubts on how long this engine will last.  
<br>
On the first lap, I got turned around and fell into last place.  By the 4th lap I managed to work my way into 1st place.  
<br>
I ran into a cloud of smoke and rearended a round back wagon on accident.
<br>
The car stalled and it took me 5 minutes to get it to refire.  By that time, I was down about 2 laps.  
<br>
I managed to make up one of my laps, but ran out of time.  I brought the car home and still have it.
<br>
I loved the 6 inch blue flames coming out of the header pipes in the hood.
<br> 
I have pulled the engine out and will run it next year in a 78 Impala Wagon I've picked up.
<br>
I will run it again without a radiator and see how long it lasts.
