<h3> Welcome to the Nature of the Universe Debate in 1998 </h3>

<p></center>

Speculation into the nature of the universe is as old as curiosity.  
Several times in the past we humans were able to discern the 
fundamentals of our surroundings.  We figured out that we live 
between vast oceans, that we live on a round Earth, that Earth 
is one of several planets in our Solar System, that our Sun was 
one of a Galaxy of billions, and that our Galaxy was one of many 
similar galaxies that exist throughout the cosmos.  
Well here we are again.  <p>

Within the past few decades we have learned that the matter 
that we see composing heaven and Earth is small in abundance 
compared to an unknown type of dark matter.  Within the past 
year the first possibly credible evidence that even this dark 
matter is small compared to a new "dark energy" that pervades 
the Universe, a "cosmological constant".   Is "dark energy" real?   
Is all the matter and energy now accounted for in the universe?   
Have we now reached the end of the quest for the major 
cosmological parameters: Hubble's Constant and Omega?   
Is cosmology now solved? <p>

In 1920 Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, two leading astronomers 
of their day, debated their current understanding of the universe, 
including whether our Galaxy was itself the whole Universe.  
Today, Turner and Peebles, two leading astronomers of today, 
debate our current understanding of the nature of the universe 
in the same auditorium, located in one of the world's premier 
museums of natural history.   We are therefore pleased to welcome 
you to the third in the series of the "Turn of the Millennium 
Debates."  Today's debate is held in honor of the late 
David N. Schramm (1945 - 1997), a great scientist originally 
involved in this debate, who helped define the frontier 
connecting the very big and the very small, between 
particle physics and cosmology.  Everyone involved in today's 
program knew him and admired him.  These public programs are 
intended to highlight important problems in astrophysics that 
exist at the end of the second millennium.  We sincerely hope 
that you find today's debate enjoyable, educational, 
and entertaining. <p>

<b>Owen Gingerich:</b> Dr. Gingerich is a senior astronomer 
at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and 
Professor of Astronomy and of the History of Science at 
Harvard University.   In 1992-1993, he chaired Harvard's History 
of Science Department.  He served as vice president of the American Philosophical Society as well as chairman of the US 
National Committee of the International Astronomical Union.  
He has co-authored leading models for the solar atmosphere, 
was awarded the Polish government's "Order of Merit", and 
an asteroid has been named in his honor. <p>

<b>Joseph I. Silk:</b> Dr. Silk is a Professor of both 
Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, 
Berkeley. In 1968 he was awarded Harvard's Bowdoin Prize, 
and in 1970 Harvard's Bok Prize.  In 1972 he was awarded 
an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, and in 1975 
a Guggenheim fellowship.  He is a Fellow of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, 
and of the American Physical Society.   In 1997 he was made an 
honorary member of the French Physical Society. <p>

<b>Margaret J. Geller:</b>  Dr. Geller is Professor of 
Astronomy at Harvard University and Senior Scientist 
at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  
In 1990 she received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.  
She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and 
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Her video 
"Where the Galaxies Are" won a CINE Gold Eagle.  
In 1996 she received the Klopsteg Award of the 
American Association of Physics Teachers. <p>

<b>Michael S. Turner:</b> Dr. Turner is the Bruce V. 
and Diana M. Rauner Distinguished Service Professor and 
Chairman of the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at The 
University of Chicago.  He is a Fellow and 
Lilenfeld Prize winner of the American Physical 
Society and in 1984 was awarded the Helen B. Warner Prize 
of the American Astronomical Society.  He has won the 
Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching 
and has held a One-Man Show at the 
Center for Particle Astrophysics Art Gallery. <p>

<b>Phillip J. E. Peebles:</b> Dr. Peebles is 
Albert Einstein Professor of Science at Princeton University.  
He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
the American Physical Society, the Royal Society, 
and the Royal Society of Canada.  In 1982 he won the 
Heineman Prize of the American Astronomical Society,
