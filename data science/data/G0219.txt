    system reads, &quot;Last chance for gas, next 4.3 light years.&quot;
    If you're using an interstellar sail, you can ignore the sign

    <!--/NOEDIT-->The original notion of space sails is to unfold
    a large aluminum coated Mylar blanket, face it to the sun, and
    let sunlight and the solar wind push the craft deeper into space.
    But that takes a long time to get anywhere. In 1984, Dr. Robert
    Forward, , vice president of Tethers Unlimited in Seattle and
    an advocate of sails and tethers for space propulsion, proposed
    giving Mother Nature a hand by using high-power laser or microwave
    transmitters that would beam for a few days or weeks to speed
    the probe on its way.</P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Gray sails could provide a better ride</FONT></B></P>

    <P>Forward's Starwisp concept would have used a mesh of superconducting
    aluminum wires to receive its &quot;push&quot; from microwave
    photons, and then reflect to produce an equal magnitude thrust.
    This would propel the craft from Earth orbit past Neptune, at
    1/20th the speed of light, in just a week. Since then, Forward
    and others have been rethinking the concept.</P>

    <P>&quot;My major message is, that's wrong, don't use it&quot;
    said Forward as he pointed at the equation he used in his initial
    studies. Since 1984, he has determined that the sail material
    would absorb a significant amount of the energy, weakening the
    structure and possibly letting it collapse.</P>

    <P>Forward now proposes putting that absorption to work in a
    &quot;gray sail&quot; made of carbon. The sail would absorb the
    light, getting a push from it, and reradiate it as infrared energy.
    With the sail oriented properly to the source, this would generate
    a significant amount of thrust in the desired direction.</P>

    <P>A mission to interstellar space could be accomplished with
    a combination sail. An aluminum coating - just 70 atoms thick
    - would serve as a traditional reflective solar sail to boost
    the spacecraft out of Earth orbit, then cancel its solar orbital
    velocity so it plunges on a near-miss trajectory towards the
    sun.</P>

    large as a sail for space propulsion, but will provide valuable
    technical lessons on how to build one. (NASA)</FONT></P>

    <P>As it passes just 3 solar diameters from the sun's visible
    surface, the aluminum would evaporate, exposing the carbon structure
    underneath. The carbon would absorb sunlight and heat to 2,000
    K (almost 3,600 deg. F). Radiating infrared light would accelerate
    the craft at 14 times Earth's gravity (the Space Shuttle reaches
    a maximum of 3 G during launch).</P>

    <P>&quot;The trajectory is nearly a straight line&quot; away
    from the sun, Forward said. He is proposing a laboratory demonstration
    using a 1 kilowatt microwave beam to levitate a 2.5 cm (1 in.)
    square, 02.5 micron-thick carbon film in a vacuum chamber.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Speaking to the keynote banquet
        for the 10th annual Advanced Propulsion Research Workshop, Art

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">He said that one goal is to increase
        the safety of space travel to be comparable to flights on commercial
        airliners within 40 years. Other goals include increasing a vehicle's
        life span to 10,000 missions, and reducing the turnaround between
        missions to a few hours with a crew of two persons.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;What we're talking about
        here is a revolution in space transportation,&quot; he said,

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Referring to a 1940s-style graphic
        shown at the start of his talk, Stephenson said that &quot;We're
        in the good old days, looking to the future.&quot; He later cautioned
        that &quot;We're really in the dark ages&quot; with regard to

        in 2005. The latter effort supports work on a launcher that would
        incorporate a magnetic-levitated sled to accelerate the vehicle
        (below), then engines that would work as a rocket, then a ramjet,
        then a rocket again, all to reduce weight and flight costs.</FONT></P>

        <P>Landis also finds carbon sails attractive in a reworked approach
        to Forward's Starwisp concept. Landis proposes using millimeter-wave
        radio to push a carbon sail. Millimeter-wave transmitters are
        more efficient than lasers, so less power would be needed to
        run the system.</P>

        <P>&quot;If you're pushing terawatts into space,&quot; Landis
        said of the beaming system, &quot;it's expensive.&quot;</P>

        <P>A lens to focus the millimeter waves (using techniques similar
        to those that steer phased-array radar beams) would only have
        to be 185 km wide, as compared to a 50,000 km fresnel lens that
        would be required for a system.</P>

        <P>The sail itself would be made of carbon fibers, or possibly
        with variants of the high-temperature superconductors that have
        been in development since the early 1990s. The transmitter technology
        already is becoming available through megawatt-power, 1,110 gigahertz
        (0.78 mm wavelength) gyrotrons developed for fusion power experiments.</P>

        <P>Landis suggested a laboratory demonstration using a 2 cm (4/5th
        inch) diameter cone. Shaping it so it would stay on the beam
        &quot;is a tricky design problem, but it's a design problem with
        a solution,&quot; he said.</TD> 
      </TR>
    </TABLE><BR CLEAR="ALL"></P>

    <P>A precursor space mission, carrying a 1 kg (2.2 lb) payload
    on a 10x10-meter sail would take 20 hours to accelerate. In three
    weeks, it would pass the orbit of Pluto and continue outward
    to the Oort cloud of comets surrounding the solar system. Reaching
    a star would take 400 years, so it's only good as a demonstration.</P>

    <P>&quot;It's still science fiction,&quot; Landis said, &quot;but
    it's near-term science fiction.&quot;</P>

    <P>Even closer at hand is a concept to sail without a deploying
    a sail, but throwing a switch and generating one around the spacecraft.
    In an approach called Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion -
    or M2P2 - a probe would imitate nature to get the solar wind
    to push it into deep-space.</P>

    <P>&quot;The enabling technology is pretty much available today,&quot;
    said Dr. R.M. Winglee of the University of Washington Winglee
    works in the geophysics program which studies the magnetosphere,
    the region of space around the Earth where the solar wind is
    deflected by the Earth's magnetic field.</P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Sailing in a bubble</FONT></B></P>

    <P>&quot;What we're proposing to do is create a magnetic bubble
    to deflect the solar wind,&quot; Winglee explained.</P>

    <P>Magnetic sails were proposed by Robert Zubrin, inventor of
    the Mars Direct concept. Such sails are limited, so Wingless
    suggests injecting plasma (ionized gas) that would drag the magnetic
    field lines out and generate a bubble 30 to 60 km (18-36 mi)
    in diameter.</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="adv_prop/magnetosphere_75.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"
    WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="209" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The magnetic field
    of 0.1 Tesla could be generated by a conventional solenoid, and
    the helicon plasma source &quot;is amazingly simple.&quot; With
    a bottle of just 3 kg (1.5 lb) of helium as the plasma fuel,
    the magnetic bubble could be operated for three months. The size
    of the bubble would expand and contract with variations in the
    solar wind, so the force on the 100 kg spacecraft would stay
    constant at 1 Newton (about a quarter pound). The 3 kilowatts
    of power to run the magnet and plasma generator would be powered
    by solar cells.</P>

    a mini-magnetosphere around a space probe and let the solar wind
    accelerate it into deep space. The solar wind exerts no appreciable
    push on the Earth because of the Earth's great mass. (NASA)</FONT></P>

    <P>Winglee calculates the specific impulse (a measure of efficiency),
    would be tens of thousands of seconds. That's 10 to 20 times
    better than the Space Shuttle Main Engine.</P>

    <P>&quot;We can go faster and lighter than anyone else,&quot;
    Winglee said.</P>

    <P>How fast?</P>

    <P>If launched in 2003, M2P2 would go past the heliopause, where
    the solar wind runs into the interstellar wind, by 2013. That's
    a distance of more than 150 times the distance from the sun to
    the Earth. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, will get there in 2019.</P>

    <P>Winglee said that adding dust particles to the magnetic bubble
    would enhance the thrust, and accelerate the M2P2 even faster
    for a mission to another star.</P>

    <P>After giving his briefing, Winglee received a glowing recommendation
    from sail advocate Forward: &quot;I just love the audacity of
    that concept.&quot;</P>

    <P>Forward also is closely involved in developing a precise interplanetary
    game of &quot;crack the whip&quot; that could send payloads to
    the Moon or Mars.</P>

    <P>&quot;Our goal is to develop a public transit system in space,&quot;
    said Robert Hoyt, president of Tethers Unlimited.</P>

    <P>Hoyt and Forward believe that an interlocking, well-timed
    series of rotating tethers could carry payloads from low Earth
    orbit to the surface of the Moon with almost no rocket power
    involved.</P>

    smoke and fire of rockets may try to decode tether as an acronym
    for an exotic rocket. It's not. A tether is a flexible line or
    rope connecting two objects. Scientists have known for some years
    that if two bodies were rotating at opposite ends of a tether,
    they will snap into different orbits if the tether is broken.
    That happened with the unfortunate loss of the Tethered Satellite
    System when it was flown on the Space Shuttle in 1996. If the
    bodies are moving fast enough, one could be sent on its way to
    the planets.</P>

    the trajectory for a payload dispatched from the HEFT tether
    orbiting Earth to the Lunavator Facility that will place it on

    <P>Under a contract to the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts,
    Tethers Unlimited is defining a Cislunar Tether Transport System.
    The first step is appropriately named HEFT - High-strength Electrodynamic
    Force Tether, 90 km long in orbit around the Earth. At the other
    end of the line is the Lunavator Facility, a 200 km tether -
    plus counterbalance and central mass - in orbit around the Moon.</P>

    <P>At the start, HEFT has a 1,000 kg payload at one end of the
    tether. It can start rotating by momentum exchange with payloads
    coming back from the Moon, reeling the tether in, or by using
    the tether itself as part of an electric motor (explained in
    a few paragraphs).</P>

    <P>When the payload is swung out from Earth, HEFT releases and
    the payload sails on to the moon. A little bit of rocket power
    is used on the way since tidal forces and other effects will
    usually require midcourse corrections.</TD>

    <P>The payload arrives at the Moon, just in time to meet the
    Lunavator Facility as its tip is swinging outward. At this point,
    the Lunavator orbits well clear of the Moon. To deliver the payload,
    the central mass winches its way to the end with the counterbalance.
    Now the center of mass is very close to one end of the tether.
    The other end, with the payload, swings down to the surface and
    deposits the package at zero velocity.</P>

    <P>That may sound impossible, but think of the edge of an automobile
    tire. It meets the road at zero speed (but is traveling at twice
    your car's speed when it rotates to the top). With the package
    delivered, the Lunavator Facility redistributes its masses in
    preparation for the next arrival. Or, it can pick up a package,
    at zero speed, and sling it back to Earth.</P>

    <P>Early work on the Cislunar Tether Transport System led Forward
    to extend the idea to Mars.</P>

    <P>&quot;When Rob Hoyt first started his calculations, he was
    throwing the payloads too hard,&quot; Forward said. &quot;He
    had to slow them down or otherwise they would escape from the
    combined Earth-Moon gravity field. After doing some calculations,
    I found that ordinary Spectra [the tough, light-weight fishing-line
    material used in the tethers] could throw payloads to Mars.&quot;</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="adv_prop/MERITT.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" WIDTH="200"
    HEIGHT="87" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">So he started designing for the
    next phase, the Mars-Earth Rapid Interplanetary Transport Tether
    (MERRITT) system. Forward has made another advance in that the
    outbound payload need not reach orbit. It can make an atmospheric
    ascent to 150 km (90 mi) where the EarthWhip picks it up and
    throws it outward to Mars. Like the Lunavator, the EarthWhip
    touches the payload at nearly zero relative speed, the center
    of mass shifts to balance the arrangement, and the tether releases
    the payload at the right instant to send it to Mars.</P>

    <P>Arrival at Mars is the reverse, with the MarsWhip stage dropping
    the payload into the Martian atmosphere to glide or parachute
    to its destination.</P>

    <P>&quot;It will get you in,&quot; Forward said, &quot;You don't
    need a deorbit propellant.&quot; The Martian atmosphere rules
    out tethers going directly to the surface, at least for the foreseeable
    future.</P>

    <P>The trip to Mars could be made in 116 to 162 days, depending
    on the speed of the whip tip. With aerobraking to slow the craft
    on arrival at Mars and just before contacting the MarsWhip, the
    craft can make the trip in as little as 94 days by increasing
    the speed of the EarthWhip.</P>

    <P>&quot;We have a new idea,&quot; Forward said. &quot;It looks
    pretty solid, and it looks pretty promising.&quot;</P>

    WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="133" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The first step on
    this trip will be taken in August 2000 when Marshall Space Flight
    Center flies the Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System
    (ProSEDS), a 15 km tether that will act like a small electric
    motor to lower the orbit of an expended rocket stage faster than
    natural atmospheric decay.</P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Left: NASA/Marshall engineer
    Les Johnson inspects part of the deployment mechanism for the
    ProSEDS tether mission. (NASA)</FONT></P>

    <P>&quot;We believe that an electrodynamic tether has a lot of
    applications,&quot; said Les Johnson, the principal investigator
    at NASA/Marshall.</P>

    <P>ProSEDS' tether will expose the last 5 km of wire to make
    an electrical connection to the plasma (electrified gas) surrounding
    the Earth. As the rocket stage (the second stage of a Delta II
    that will launch an Air Force satellite) orbits the Earth, the
    wire cuts through the Earth's magnetic field. With electronics
    on the stage completing the circuit, the tether thus generates
    an electrical current at the expense of its speed, thus lowering
    its altitude.</P>

    <P>&quot;After ProSEDS, there may be a commercialization of this
    concept,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;with operators putting these
    onboard spacecraft to deorbit rocket stages without using fuel.&quot;</P>

    <P>NASA is also studying an Electrodynamic Tether Upper Stage
    that - by proper control of the electrical current - could boost
    satellites to higher orbits, then return itself to a lower orbit
    to deliver more satellites. A highly profitable application could
    be on the International Space Station where a low-cost electrodynamic
    tether could save about $1 billion a year in the cost of supplying
    reboost propellants.</TD>
