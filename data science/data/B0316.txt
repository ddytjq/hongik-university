</u><br>
The Superstart Account has been designed especially for 12 to 18 year-olds and offers a
preferential interest rate to provide young savers with a real incentive to leave their
money in the account and keep saving. You will also receive a £5 WHSmith voucher! </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>How much can I invest?</i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You only need £25 to open a Superstart Account and you can add to this
  amount at any time. <strong>The most you can invest is £10,000 per child</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">This figure may be exceeded if we add on interest.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>How and when is interest paid? </i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Your money earns interest from the day after you invest in your
  Superstart Account and on every day until&nbsp; you withdraw it. The current interest rate
  is shown on our Interest Rate leaflet. Please note that if the balance falls below £25,
  the Society&#146;s Cashbuild Account base interest rate will be applied. Interest is paid
  on 31st December each year and we add this money to your account</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>How and when can I withdraw my money? </i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Your money is available without the need to give any notice and on
  visiting any one of our branches or agents at any time you can withdraw up to £300 in
  cash and larger amounts by cheque.&nbsp; Please note cheques paid into you account require
  seven working days to clear before withdrawals can be made against them.</font></p>

find out the current interest rate please look at our Interest Rates Page or check with
any of our branches or agents.<br>
<br>
Parents can each give their children a lump sum that produces up to £100 income before
tax each year. But if the income exceeds £100, the whole amount is taxed as the Parents
income. This rule only applies to Parents. Children can register as non-tax payers and
receive the interest gross, as long as their total income is not greater than their
personal allowance.<br>
<br>
If you have received interest with no tax taken off, and you think you should have paid
it, or if you are not sure whether you should pay tax, you should get in touch with your
Inland Revenue tax office.<br>
<br>
You must include the amount of interest you earn in your yearly Income Tax Return.<br>
