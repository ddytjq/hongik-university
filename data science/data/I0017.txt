the covered South Stand which runs alongside the pitch. The stand is quite old and lacking many facilities found in
more modern stadium. We have been informed that the South Stand is being demolished this year and
is being replaced
with a new modern stand of similar capacity. There are also plans for a Hotel and a gym in the area around the South Stand. 
Food is available (under the stand) which includes the excellent
Hollands Pies. Smoking is allowed, but beer is not available. The seats whilst being plastic 
are remarkedly uncomfortable, and a large number of seats have views obscured by some large 
supporting pillars. 
</P><P>Visiting fans are normally allowed to flags, banners and drum into the ground (the stewards
even suggested an improved location on which to hang banners on our last visit).
</P><P>The ground is about 15 mins walk from the city centre and about 5 from the station.
</P><P>It is believed this stand is due for either rebuilding or major improvements in the near future.

offers a huge choice. An excellent pub guide for all of
Norwich can be found at <a class="entry" href="http://www.norwichpubs.co.uk">
http://www.norwichpubs.co.uk</a>.
</P><P>We haven't come across a friendlier place for pre match beer and there are quite a few pubs
within a few minutes walking distance of the ground.
</P><P>One pub that is popular with away fans that we have been unable to comment on is
The Compleat Angler which was closed during our last visit.

small lift bridge over the river that you will pass just before the ground (if arriving by car).
</P><P>This was a medium size pub with very friendly staff, large screen Sky Sports and a pool table around the back.
</P><P>Lager was around £2 a pint, but unfortunately it was served in plastic glasses and whilst there was a selection
of bitters (including Boddingtons) no Real Ale was available.
</P><P>Be warned if you are attempting to meet people here as no mention of the pubs name can be found on the exterior. The
pub has a small car park out front and a slightly larger one around the back, but both are reserved on match days.

we've seen. On entering the front door it appears to be a VERY small 'local' however a small door leads onto a corridor
with a couple more larger rooms, one with a large screen TV and another with a large stone floor aimed at a families and dinners.
It also has a beer garden overlooking the river.

excellent and wasn't too expensive.

The pub is very close to both the station and the coach parks so often gets very busy with both home and away fans. Whilst
much of the memorobilia adorning the walls is rugby related, on match days this is definately a football pub. A range of Real
Ale was available (in real glasses) and some good looking food (they also have a special 'Football Menu'which is mainly 
burgers, sandwiches and chips and was quite expensive .
</P><P>The toliets also had big chalk boards encouraging you to abuse your opponents in a non-destructive way.
</P><P>There is a small (full) car park out front and a few tables.

also sells their own home brew "On The Ball" brewed by the "Canary Brewing Company". 
Unfortunately plastic glasses are used but 
it is nice to have a pub close to the ground were home and away fans can happily mix. 
Inside is large, but its normally packed solid and normally people spill out onto the veranda and car park.
</P><P>Sky sports is available inside and the bar service was very quick and this is another pub with an abuse your
opponents style chalk board in the gents.

they do like you to buy a pint in the bar.
