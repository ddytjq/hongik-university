<h1> <b>An incomplete list of C++ compilers</h1> </b>
</center>
<p align=right>
Modified June 28, 2002
<p>
I (<a href="homepage.html">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>) am often asked to recommend
a C++ compiler.
However, I don't make recommendations; that would be too much like taking sides
in commercial wars.
Also, I don't know every C++ compiler; there are simply too many "out there".
I use half-a-dozen C++ compilers on a regular basis, but that's only
scratching the surface.
<p>
I recommend that people take Standard conformance very serious when
considering a compiler. If you can, avoid any compiler that doesn't closely
approximate the ISO standard and supplies a solid implementation of the
standard library.
The recent releases from all the major C++ vendors do that.
<p>
If you are a novice and don't know how to see if a compiler is conformant, try this:
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	#include&lt;string>

	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		string s;
		cout << "Please enter your first name followed by a newline\n";
		cin >> s;
		cout << "Hello, " << s << '\n';
		return 0; // this return statement isn't necessary
	}
</pre>
If an implementation cannot handle this simple program as written, it is not
a good candidate for learning Standard C++ (if you cut and
paste, beware of html for "less than" in the #include directives).
<p>
Here is <a href="http://www.cuj.com/roundup/a.htm">a long article considering conformance</a> and
<a href="http://www.boost.org/status/compiler_status.html">boost.org's compiler status page</a>.
Conformance is just one aspect of a compiler's quality (quality of generated
code, error messages, compile speed, integration with tools, degree of support,
and backwards compatibility are examples of other important aspects),
but conformance is an important one.
Use of a supplier's language extensions and non-standard-conforming features
limits the portability of you code and can prevent you from choosing a new
implementation supplier.
<p>
Most of these compilers are embedded in frameworks of software development
tools and libraries. These frameworks, environments, and libraries can be
most helpful, but do remember that their use can lock you into a single vendor
and that some uses have significant run-time performance implications.
<p>
When looking for C++ on the web, you find that much of the information is
"hidden" under various product names. In fact, I had more luck finding
C++ compilers using google.com than by going directly to vendors that I knew
sold them.
Here, I have chosen to list C++
implementations simply by the name of their provider, ignoring marketing
labels.
<p>
Some compilers that can be downloaded for free (do check their
conditions/licenses before attempting commercial use):

</ul>
It is impossible for me to keep this list complete and up-to-date.
The C++ world is just too large and too much new is happening.
Apologies to those suppliers who I failed to list, I know there are some,
and please, if you have a link that you think ought to be listed here,
send me a message: bs@research.att.com.
Again: I just list compilers, I don't endorse them.
Also, there can be no one compiler that is best for everyone, people's needs
differ too much for that.
