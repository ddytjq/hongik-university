<P>Science and religion have always been at war with one another,
right? Isn't that what we've all been taught? Isn't that what
the trial of Galileo was all about? In fact this widely held view
is a distortion of the historical truth. On the contrary, historians
over the past fifty years have revealed that for most of history
science and religion have been deeply entwined.</P>

<P>Historian <!g><A HREF="../bio/num-body.html">Ronald Numbers</a>, an expert on the relationship between
science and religion, points out that for hundreds of years one
of the most prevailing models in Western culture was what was
known as the &quot;two books&quot; - these being the books of
Scripture and the book of Nature. From the Middle Ages through
the nineteenth century most people in the Western world believed
that both books were the work of God, and so &quot;it was impossible
that the two should conflict.&quot;</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>When we look at the history of science,
we see that in fact it owes an immense debt to the religious world.
In the early Middle Ages - a time when Christian Europe turned
away from scientific thinking - the science, mathematics, and
astronomy of the ancient Greeks was kept alive in the Islamic
world, where it was further developed and enriched by Moslem scholars.
In the thirteenth century when this scientific heritage began
to filter back into Western Europe, it was originally taken up
by Christian monks and theologians.</P>

<P>Throughout the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, most scientific
leaders were men of the church, They included the great medieval
champion of mathematical science Robert Grosseteste (Bishop of
Oxford, and the man who reinvigorated the science of geometric
optics); the medieval champion of experimental science Roger Bacon
(a Franciscan monk, sometimes known as the medieval Galileo);
the fifteenth century proto-physicist Nicholas of Cusa (a cardinal
in the Roman Catholic Church and the man who first championed
the idea of an infinite universe); and Nicholas Copernicus (a
canon at Frauenburg Cathedral, and the man who more than any other
introduced the idea of a sun-centered <!g><A HREF="../physgloss/cosmos-body.html">cosmos</a>.)</P>

<P>Up until the eighteenth century, most of those in Europe studying
science were indeed men of deep religious faith, many of them
formally schooled in theology. In part that was because the church
controlled the institutes of higher learning - particularly the
universities, which had originally been set up as training grounds
for the clergy and other church functionaries.</P>

<P>In popular mythology, the &quot;<!g><A HREF="../gengloss/revolution-body.html">scientific revolution</a>&quot;
of the seventeenth century is commonly said to mark a fundamental
break between science and religion. But nothing could be further
from the truth. Almost all the great pioneers and founders of
the new science were religious men who wanted a science that would
harmonize with their faith. All three founders of the new heliocentric
<!g><A HREF="../physgloss/cosml-body.html">cosmology</a> - Nicholas Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and <!g><A HREF="../physgloss/newt-body.html">Isaac Newton</a>
- saw their new vision of the universe as an offshoot of their
theology. Newton. in particular, was a religious fanatic whose
whole life work can be seen as a search for God. Even the infamous
Galileo was a committed Catholic who wanted nothing more than
for the Pope to endorse his vision of the heavens.</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Not until the eighteenth century do we
see a fundamental break between science and religion. In the new
rationalistic climate of the <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/enlight-body.html">Enlightenment</a> philosophers such as
Immanuel <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/kant-body.html">Kant</a> and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that science and
religion were two separate domains that must be kept apart. But
even in the eighteenth century there was no idea of a warfare
between the two spheres. That idea only arose in the late nineteenth
century, particularly after the publication of Charles Darwin's
revolutionary book, &quot;On the Evolution of Species by Means
of <!g><A HREF="../biogloss/natsel-body.html">Natural Selection</a>.&quot; In the wake of this book, some Christian
believers and theologians began to see science as a threat to
their faith. On the other hand, some scientists also began to
see religion as a threat to scientific freedom. Although there
have always been people on both sides who did not see a conflict
between science and Christian faith, nonetheless this &quot;warfare&quot;
model has had a powerful influence on Western thinking throughout
the twentieth century.</P>
