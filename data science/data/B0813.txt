<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2"><p>APR 5.4% variable; rate correct as at 1 December 2001. <b>Typical
  Example:</b> a repayment mortgage for £125,000 over period of 25 years on a property
  valued at £175,000. The gross monthly payments for the first 36 months will be £666.79
  and 264 months at £776.56. The APR, the monthly payments and the total amount payable
  have been calculated on the assumption that the variable mortgage rate will remain
  constant throughout the term of the mortgage. At the end of the three year discount period
  the Society&#146;s variable mortgage rate then applicable will apply. The total amount
  payable will be £229,056.28, which includes a valuation fee of £205 (paid to an external
  valuer) refunded on completion and a redemption fee of £40. If the amount borrowed
  exceeds 75% of the property purchase price or valuation (whichever is lower) a Mortgage
  Indemnity Guarantee fee is paid by the Society on your behalf. Full written quotations are
  available on request. Security in the form of a legal mortgage over the property will be
  required. Mortgages are only available to persons over the age of 18 and are subject to
  status.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*You are free to instruct your own solicitor although you will then be
  responsible for your solicitor&#146;s costs. Any fees or payments which do not relate to
  the mortgage, such as changing names or title defects will be payable by you.</p>
