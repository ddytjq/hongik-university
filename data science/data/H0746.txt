<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

We present a statistical model of genes in DNA. A Generalized Hidden Markov
Model (GHMM) provides the framework for describing the grammar of a legal parse
of a DNA sequence (Stormo and Haussler, 1994). Probabilities are assigned to
transitions between states in the GHMM and to the generation of each nucleotide
base given a particular state. Machine learning techniques are applied to optimize
these probabilities using a standardized training set. Given a new candidate
sequence, the best parse is deduced from the model using a dynamic programming
algorithm to identify the path through the model with maximum probability. The
GHMM is flexible and modular, so new sensors and additional states can be inserted
easily. In addition, it provides simple solutions for integrating cardinality 
constraints, reading frame constraints, ``indels'', and homology searching. 

<p>
The description and results of an implementation of such a gene-finding model,
called Genie, is presented. The exon sensor is a codon frequency model 
conditioned on windowed nucleotide frequency and the preceding codon. 
Two neural networks are used, as in (Brunak et al., 1991), for 
splice site prediction. 

<p>
We show that this simple model performs quite well. For a cross-validated standard
test set of 304 genes 
[<a href="ftp://www-hgc.lbl.gov/pub/genesets"> 
ftp://www-hgc.lbl.gov/pub/genesets</a>] 
in human DNA, our
gene-finding system identified up to 85% of protein-coding bases correctly with a
specificity of 80%. 58% of exons were exactly identified with a specificity of 51%.
Genie is shown to perform favorably compared with several other gene-finding
systems.
