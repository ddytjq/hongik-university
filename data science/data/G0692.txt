<div class="mainheader">What Powered the Big Bang?</div>

<p><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="/images/cmb.jpg" border="0" alt="Black Hole Simulation"></td></tr></table>In its simplest form, the Big Bang is the logical beginning to an expanding Universe.  Edwin Hubble discovered in the 1920s that the Universe was expanding.  Other scientists built upon this idea and concluded that the Universe was considerably denser and hotter billions of years ago.  Play the history of time backwards, and one arrives at a finite moment of near infinite density -- the beginning of time.  The Big Bang was the explosion that set the expansion and time itself into motion.</p>

<p>Big Bang theory cannot account for how fast the Universe has grown, nor can it explain the vast structure we see today.  The Big Bang predicts that matter should be evenly distributed, yet there are stars, galaxies, and vast regions of seemingly empty space.  Something clearly powered the Big Bang, fueled its expansion, and left the seeds that turned into galaxies.</p>

<p>Cosmologists, who study the origin and evolution of the Universe, hope to augment Big Bang theory to explain how we got from there to here.  One idea is called inflation, a period of incomprehensible expansion in which the Universe grew from an atomic scale to a cosmic scale in a fraction of a second.</p>  

<p>Inflation could have left the expanding Universe with pockets of slightly denser regions.  At that point, gravity took over in a classic case of the rich get richer.  Regions with slightly higher densities had the gravitational potential to attract more matter, making them denser yet.  Less dense regions lost matter, becoming even less dense.</p>  

<p>The region of space that contains our Milky Way galaxy, for example, was only about 0.5% denser than neighboring regions 400,000 years after the Big Bang.  After about 15 million years, the Milky Way region was about 5% denser than surrounding regions.  (Mind you, our Galaxy still wasn't formed at this point.)  A billion years after this, though, our region was about twice as dense as neighboring regions.  Cosmologists speculate that the inner part of the Milky Way galaxy began forming at this time.</p>

<p>The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) and microwave missions to follow, such as Planck and CMBPOL, will test inflation and other theories about what may have happened in the first second after the Big Bang.  These missions study the first light of the Universe, the afterglow of the Big Bang called the cosmic microwave background.</p>  

<p>Different ideas about how structure first formed -- inflation, topological defects, and others -- make very specific predictions about the size and location of temperature differences in this background radiation.  Upon measuring the ancient radiation to the utmost precision, scientists can compare its survey results to these predictions to see which idea is correct.</p>  

<p>Inflation theory, a leading contender, was proposed in 1980, in part, by Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with others.  Here's the gist of it.  The Universe is born.  That point of infinity density starts to expand, becoming less dense and thus cooler.  All within a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, new forces emerge.  A theorized energy field called the Higgs field -- which in a few short moments later will start to interact with particles to produce the phenomenon known as "mass" -- is born from the chaos.</p>  

<p>Guth theorized what would happen if that energy field was unable, briefly, to release its energy.  What if it were blocked?  Guth proposed that there would be a cosmic blowout, a latent energy that would push the Universe apart.  The size of the Universe would double 60 times over in a thousandth of a second.  As the Universe expanded, matter gets shuffled around.  By the end of inflation, matter is no longer evenly distributed.</p>

<p>Of course, inflation is the dynamite, as theorist Michael Turner of the University of Chicago says.  Cosmologists are still looking for the match.  The only way to understand what lit inflation is to revisit the scene of the crime -- to travel back in time to the moment of the Big Bang.</p>

<p>MAP and Planck are two Cosmic Journeys missions that serve as time machines.  The temperature differences that these missions see in the cosmic microwave background were fossilized around 400,000 years after the Big Bang.  What's more, the variations were first imprinted just after the period of inflation, about 10<sup>-25</sup> second after the Big Bang.  Whatever happened at this moment in time was "locked" into the cosmic microwave background.</p>  

<p>The CMBPOL mission will study the polarization of the cosmic microwave background, as opposed to temperature differences.  Polarization was locked into the cosmic microwave background by events that took place 10^-35 second after the Big Bang, at the beginning of the proposed inflation era.</p>

<p>The Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA) mission may make the first detection of gravitational waves from the inflation era.  A mission that would follow LISA would investigate further.  Yet another Cosmic Journeys mission called OWL will collect cosmic rays that may be generated locally by topological defects -- folds in the fabric of space -- that possess the type of energy seen in the inflation period.  Indeed, these theoretical topological defects may have been produced by the rapid expansion of inflation.</p>  

<p>All these Cosmic Journeys missions provide the important observational data to determine which theories are correct about the birth of the Universe.</p>

<p>As we probe farther back in time, we see connections in matter, space, time and energy -- as if they are all they same concept.  For example, physicists use particle accelerators to create new forms of matter and energy by reproducing temperatures and densities seen in the early Universe.</p>  

<p>The goal is to understand the nature of the four known fundamental forces:  gravity (important in the largest scales), electromagnetism (light), strong forces (the glue holding atoms together), and weak forces (seen in radioactive decay).</p>  

<p>The best particle accelerators can generate energies analogous to those present 10<sup>10</sup> second after the Big Bang, the so called "electro-weak" era.  That's impressive.  Physicists have used particle accelerators, in fact, to determine that electromagnetism and weak forces are one in the same.  The two forces were once united as one up until about 10<sup>-10</sup> second after the Big Bang.</p>  

<p>Perhaps strong forces are the same as electro-weak forces at higher temperatures.  The quest to fold strong forces into electro-weak is called the Grand Unified Theory, or GUT.  The energies needed to determine this are far beyond the reach of particle accelerators.</p>  

<p>These energies did exist, however, around 10<sup>-35</sup> second after the Big Bang, during the GUT era.  The CMBPOL mission is knocking on GUT's door, just on the outside border of the end of the GUT era.  The Theory of Everything attempts to unite gravity with the quantum forces of strong, weak, and electromagnetic, perhaps as early as 10<sup>-42</sup> second in time.  Understanding how all the forces fit together will provide the answer of what powered the Universe.</p>

<p>The quantum world is strange indeed, a place where electrons can exist in two places at once and where subatomic particles pop in and out of existence for fractions of a second.  These quantum fluctuations, as they are called, may have sparked in entire Big Bang.  Inflation, too, may have been caused by quantum fluctuations blocking the Higgs field, creating an underlying energy field with negative gravity.</p>

<p>Through observations of the infinite to the infinitesimal, the answer to what powered the Big Bang will reveal itself to us.</p>
