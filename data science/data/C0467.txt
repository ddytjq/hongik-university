            <p align="left">In addition, CSL managed aviation syndicate 173 which 
              underwrote through a consortium arrangement with the Amlin PLC Group. 
              The consortium ended at 31 December 1998 and the result for the 
              1997 underwriting year is a loss of 7.7%, compared with the previous 
              forecast of &#150;12.5% to &#150;7.5%. The forecast range for syndicate 
              173&#146;s 1998 year remains unchanged from that previously announced 
              (-15.0% to -10.0%).</p>
            <p align="left">The results and forecasts are net of standard personal 
              expenses for an individual Name at managing agent&#146;s level (ie 
              after annual subscriptions, levies and managing agents&#146; fees 
              and commissions but before members&#146; agents&#146; charges). 
              The forecasts are made subject to the usual caveats that apply to 
              Lloyd&#146;s syndicate forecasts and are based on information prepared 
              for the 31 December 1999 Syndicate Returns. In addition, syndicate 
              173&#146;s forecast is dependent on the syndicate&#146;s final year 
              being closed as at 31 December 2000 into Amlin&#146;s syndicate

              In order to generate more income and to reduce volatility, the Board 
              of Chaucer Holdings decided to sell the Company&#146;s entire holding 
              of Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invest the proceeds of &pound;13.3 
              million in the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust. The Company&#146;s 
              investments are currently valued at &pound;39.5 million and now 
              comprise 88.6 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit

            <p>&quot;Malcolm has been Chief Executive of the Group since its inception 
              in 1997, following a distinguished career at Lloyd&#146;s. We will 
              miss his leadership and experience and wish him a speedy recovery. 
              Ray has had a long and successful career at Lloyd&#146;s and I am

            <p>&#147;I am sorry to be leaving Chaucer at this time. Although much 
              remains to be done to fulfil the aspirations of both management 
              and shareholders, much has also been achieved in a very short space 
              of time. I look forward to seeing the Group fulfil its potential 
              as one of the leading underwriting businesses at Lloyd&#146;s&#148;. 
              Bob Stuchbery, Underwriting Director, said: <br>
              &#147;We are pleased with the 1997 results for our marine and non-marine 
              syndicates and their positive mid point forecasts for 1998, both 
              of which should compare very favourably with their peer groups. 
              Our motor side has suffered along with the rest of that sector and 
              although rates have been improving we will experience another loss 
              in the 1999 year.&#148; </p>
