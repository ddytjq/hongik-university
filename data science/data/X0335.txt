<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to ensure that LD competitions
follow the same rules all over the planet now and for all. Here you will
find guidlines how to organize and run an LD tournament properly. We are
very much interested in helping you to hold a well organized and accurate
LD tournament. Contact us at <a href="mailto:ld@baggressive.com">ld@baggressive.com</a>
if you require assistance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Always keep in mind:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">LD is the most dangerous boomerang event !
Be serious about this and brief the competitors accordingly. Send spectators
sufficiently far away ! Read our <a href="safety.htm">safety advice</a>
carefully.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">You will need at least 10 people to hold a
proper tournament, because you need at least 6 spotters on the field to
measure the distance of the boomerangs.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Boomerangs do not need to be caught upon their
return.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Metallic LD boomerangs are not allowed in
tournaments due to safety regulations.</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Paint your boomerangs with a bright neon
color to facilitate spotting it in the air and finding it on the ground.</font></ul>

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 BGCOLOR="#003300" >
<tr>
<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You do not need a lot of stuff to organize
an LD tournament. You need a baseline of 40m length, made out of a rope
or a ribbon, and a half circle at the center with a diameter of 2 m (marked
with ribbon, chalk or paint). The end of the baseline is marked with a
post on each side. The baseline is usually perpendicular to the wind direction.
However, the thrower may have it rotated around the center as he wishes.&nbsp;</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="440" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><img SRC="setup.gif" height=206 width=440></td>

<td WIDTH="467"><img SRC="valid.gif" height=198 width=467></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the throw to be valid, at least one
foot of the thrower has to be on the ground inside the center half circle
at the moment of release of the boomerang, and the thrower must NOT cross
the line <i>at any time </i>as long as the boom is in the air. The boomerang
has to cross the baseline upon return, either directly or from behind,
otherwise the throw is not valid (cf. drawing with valid / not valid boomerang
flightpaths).&nbsp;</font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Officials &amp; Spotters</font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The head official's place is near the throwing
circle. He runs the tournament. He calls forth the throwers, ensures correct
throwing from the center circle, and communicates with the head spotter
on the field. There may be another official helping him in his task. In
addition, there are two line judges at the left and right end of the baseline,
respectively, to judge whether the boomerang crosses the line or is out
of bounds.&nbsp;</font>
<p><img SRC="spotting.gif" height=300 width=304 align=LEFT><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There
is a number of spotters on the field to determine the farthest point of
the boomerang's flightpath. We suggest the spotter arrangement shown in
the schematic on the left. You have to be aware that if the boomerang is
more or less flying over you, it is difficult for you to judge where the
projected path on the ground actually is. Only by spotting from a distance
off to the side are you able to determine the apex of the flightpath accurately.
Therefore, we suggest placing a row of spotters to the left and right of
the expected throwing corridor, respectively, with a ~20m distance between
the spotters within one row. You can also align the two rows in a a staggered
manner to get a better coverage. The spotters should be spread such that
all throws, including the shortest and farthest ones, can be precisely
spotted. Send the farthest spotter sufficiently far out, as there may always
be "lucky" throws. One of the head spotter's duties is to ensure that the
spotters are distributed correctly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Don't use more spotters than necessary
to fulfil the task, because with too many spotters they tend to walk about
and have chats ! 6 is the minimum (+1 head spotter), 12 should be enough
in all cases. Here's what you have to do as a spotter: Follow the boomerang
on its way out with your extended arm and stop when you think it reached
its farthest point. Then project that point down onto the ground by lowering
your arm vertically. Fix the point on the ground with your eyes and direct
the head spotter to that point. At least one other spotter will do the
same, so the head spotter will have to position himself such that the closest
2-4 spotters are happy with the result. Often, there is a little arguing
about the farthest point, but that's the interesting part of spotting:
discuss until there is agreement ! The spotters that could not see the
apex of the flightpath very well should not interfere ! The maximum distance
of the boomerang is now defined as the distance from the head spotter to
the center of the throwing circle. If you have a Laser Rangefinder (e.g.
a <a href="http://www.bushnell.com">Bushnell</a>) you can measure the distance
immediately, otherwise you have to place a marker in the ground and measure
the distance at the end of the round with a (steel !) tape.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We estimate the accuracy of the measurement
with this "spotting" method is 2m in the best case, 5m on average, and
more if the spotters are not placed very well or if they are not paying
attention. It is actually helpful to distribute thin wooden sticks (~2m
long) to the spotters, with the help of which it is much easier to follow
the flying boomerang at its farthest point and drop the perpendicular to
the ground.&nbsp;</font>
