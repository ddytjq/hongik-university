      <p><b>The Elk hunt</b> is difficult to draw, but if you are lucky enough 
        to draw it, then you will be in for the hunt of a lifetime. These Nevada 
        bulls have a great gene pool, the chance of harvesting a quality trophy 
        bull can be yours with our services. We have good knowledge of where these 
        bulls call home and can give you the best opportunity to harvest one. 
        Elk hunts are conducted using four-wheel drive vehicles, horses and a 
        lot of hiking. We hunt using spot and stalk tactics. Elk hunting can be 
        arduous but exhilarating, you can make your hunt much more enjoyable if 
        you arrive in good physical condition ready to hunt. An Elk Hunt is one 
        of the best Nevada has to offer. In the 2001 Elk season we had 15 of 16 
        hunters harvest Bulls.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>High Desert Nevada Mule Deer</b> bucks are very crafty, but the trophy 
        possibilities are here. It is not uncommon to see bucks 25 inches or over 
        and with our services you have a better chance to get a crack at one. 
        We use four-wheel drive vehicles, horses, spot and stalk tactics and hiking 
        to get you in on your trophy. Your hunt will be most enjoyable if you 
        are in good physical condition. Hunt with us for your chance at a Nevada 
        Muley. </p>
      <p><b>Antelope</b> hunting is definitely fun! We know the habitat of these 
        curious animals and how to get you in on one. The bucks you&#146;ll see 
        range from about 13 inches and up. Four-wheel drive vehicles will get 
        us in proximity of the Antelope. Spot and stalk methods are used for hunting, 
        however, stalking can be challenging in the sagebrush flats. This is a 
        hunt you'll never forget.</p>
      <p><b>Mountain Lion Hunts</b> are by far the most unpredictable, challenging 
        and sometimes frustrating. Where this hunt goes is entirely left to chance 
        and chase of the lion. There are so many uncontrolled factors and conditions 
        that contribute to this hunt, each is unique. Hunts can run from as little 
        as 40 minutes to well over 4 miles. Definitely not a hunt for the faint 
        of heart. The chase is a far greater thrill than the actual kill, but 
        to harvest a cat is certainly worth every minute and every effort expended. 
        The only Nevada Big Game Hunt that non-resident and residents can purchase 
        tags and licenses for over the counter.</p>
