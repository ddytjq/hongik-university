Cooling System</A>
</H2>

<P>
The low temperature required by the bolometers must be provided by an
active cooling system, which will consist of a number of Stirling-cycle
mechanical coolers coupled to an open-cycle He dilution refrigerator. The mechanical
coolers will provide precooling of <SUP>3</SUP>He and <SUP>4</SUP>He cryogen down to 4 K, as 
well as control of the temperature of the outermost radiation shield of
the HFI to <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">65 K (Figure 3.6a);
the dilution system (consisting of an initial Joule-Thompson stage
followed by the <SUP>3</SUP>He/<SUP>4</SUP>He dilution refrigerator) carries the cooling down to 0.1 K
(Figure 3.6b). The overall system is very similar to that which will be used
by FIRST (an approved ESA cornerstone mission). 

<P>
The basis of the Planck mechanical cooler technology is the development by Oxford
University and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) of an 80 K cooler that
was space qualified for the ISAMS instrument, and the further development at 
RAL of a two
stage Stirling Cycle Cooler achieving 20-50 K, and a closed cycle Joule-Thomson
Expansion Cooler achieving 4 K. British Aerospace (now Matra Marconi Space),
funded by ESA, has successfully
transferred this technology to an industrial level and can provide space
qualified 4 K coolers. The long life and high reliability of these systems
result from the use of a frictionless compressor that has demonstrated 
successful space operation for periods of years. A 4K cooler would provide for
cooling power both
at about 20 K (<IMG

 ALT="$\sim$">50 mW) and at 4.4 K (<IMG

 ALT="$\sim$">10 mW).

The Open Cycle Dilution/Joule-Thomson Refrigerator has been
developed at the Centre de Recherches des Tr&#232;s Basses
Temperatures (CRTBT) in Grenoble (France) (Benoit <I>et&nbsp;al.</I>994). 
It uses a new dilution principle
based on friction that does not need gravity to operate.
Its cooling power depends on the gas flow, which is very low and thus allows 
sufficient gas
storage to achieve long mission life. 
For a total (<SUP>3</SUP>He and <SUP>4</SUP>He)
flow rate of 12 <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$\mu$">mole/s, a cooling power of 100 nW at 0.1 K has been
demonstrated. In the same process, the mixture is expanded in a Joule-Thomson
valve, producing a cooling power of several hundreds of <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$\mu$">W at 1.6 K. 
This is enough to insure a proper insulation of the 0.1 K stage from
the radiative and conductive thermal loads coming from the 4 K stage. The
principle of this cryogenic architecture and its 
+/-1 g operation have been
successfully proven with a demonstration model, and
qualification of this system for space operation is in progress.
 Astronomical observations have been performed with bolometers
cooled at 85 mK with this system at the focus of the 30 m IRAM telescope.

<P>
Bolometric detectors of the type to be used in the HFI are known to be
sensitive to microphonic noise induced by mechanical vibrations.  Since the
instrument will operate in conjunction with mechanical coolers, it is
important to verify that the cooler vibration does not cause degradation of the
performance of the detectors. As initial measures, the coolers and displacers
will be mounted back-to-back (in the case of the 50-80 K cooler resulting in
the addition of one completely redundant cooler), and driven with electronic
circuits especially designed to minimize vibrations. 
 Secondly, the mechanical design of the platforms which support the
coolers can be optimized to an extent where the transfer of vibrations from the
platforms to the focal plane is suppressed to levels of order 10 times lower
than what is normally considered acceptable. If any transmission of vibrations
exists, it will occur through the thermal link rather than the structure.
However, thermal links can also be designed to adequately suppress microphonic
transmission, as demonstrated for FIRST. 

<P>
In any case, an experimental programme is underway
to investigate the microphonic effects and to develop methods for
minimizing them at the bolometer level.  The results of this continuing
programme will be used to determine whether a releasable clamping/damping 
mechanism is required to ensure minimal mechanical coupling between the 
coolers and the HFI in flight. 
Initial results have been
very encouraging, and demonstrate that the problem of detector
microphonics can be contained at a level where it does not affect the
performance of the HFI significantly. 
 It is worth noting here that the mechanical excitation by the
coolers -if at all present- occurs at frequencies higher than 35 Hz, which 
would only contaminate
the measurement of spherical harmonics higher than 
<it>l</it> &#126; 2000.
