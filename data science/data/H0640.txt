AB: A critique of the article by Bogerts on the temporolimbic system theory is
presented. Schizophrenia is conceived as arising as a component of the
diversity of interhemisphric (callosal) connectivity associated with the
evolution of language, a process that occurred through a genetic change (the
speciation event) that allowed the hemispheres to develop with a degree of
independence. Language and psychosis thus have a common evolutionary origin.
The anatomical changes can be considered as a boundary component of the
anatomical variation that is characteristic of the species.<p>

AB: The relationship between spastic hemiplegia in diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
and neuroradiological findings was studied in 100 cases. These cases were
prospectively collected from the files of Automobile Insurance Rating
Organization in Japan between 1993 from to 1996. Requirements for entry to this
study were as follows: presence of initial unconsciousness after head injury
without any lucid interval. Existence of CT scan or MRI film obtained within 12
hours of injury showing no significant mass effects, as well as follow-up CT
scan or MRI film obtained more than 3 months after the injury. Psychosocial
outcome was described both by the medical professional and the caregiver. The
hemiplegia was rated severe, mild, or none. The outcome and diffuse
ventriculomegaly were classified as reported by the authors previously. Spastic
hemiplegia or quadriplegia was documented in the chronic stage in 63 cases,
including 53 severe cases with difficulty in walking and 10 mild cases with
only pyramidal signs detected. Chi-square analysis showed significant
correlation between hemiplegia and the DAI outcome level or ventriculomegaly
rating. Focal brain contusion was noticed in 33 cases, but did not correlate
with the hemiplegia at all. Radiological findings included 25 cases of
parasagittal white matter injury (gliding contusion), 20 cases of callosal
injury, 19 cases of basal ganglionic region injury, 5 cases of brain-stem
injury, and 3 cases of cerebellar injury. Chi-square analyses of hemiplegia and
contralateral presence of these injuries were significant in the former three
types of injury. Presence of at least one of these 3 lesions was defined as GCB
injury. There were altogether 46 GCB injury cases which were significantly
correlated with contralateral hemiplegia by chi-square analysis and by Spearman
rank analysis. Partial correlation analysis with hemiplegia as the target
variable indicated highly significant correlation only with GCB injury and
outcome level. In conclusion, spastic hemiplegia in DAI is a manifestation of
primary shear injury. Neuroradiological findings of GCB injury were
statistically able to be significantly correlated with the presence of
hemiplegia, and suggested pyramidal tract injury either at the corona radiata
or the internal capsule level.<p>

AB: Given the scarcity of data on the development of the cerebral cortex and
its connections in man, four brains of human fetuses at 25, 26, 30, and 32
weeks postovulation were used to investigate the following: 1) the radial
distribution of callosal neurons in the cingulate cortex at the immediate
postmigratory period; 2) the existence of callosally projecting neurons in the
cortical subplate; and 3) the dendritic morphology of developing callosal
neurons. The carbocyanine dye
(1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) (DiI) was
used as a fluorescent postmortem tracer for the identification and
morphological description of callosal neurons, 4-6 months after the insertion
of DiI crystals at the callosal midplane. Sixty-one completely labeled neurons
were selected for microscopical analysis, drawn by use of a camera lucida and
photographed. The main findings were the following: 1) the human cingulate
cortex at 25-32 weeks postovulation contains callosally projecting neurons both
in the cortical plate and in the subplate; 2) callosal cells in the plate are
mostly spiny pyramids with somata distributed uniformly throughout the depth of
the plate, irrespective of rostrocaudal position. They have well-differentiated
basal dendrites and apical dendrites that consistently ramify within layer 1;
3) subplate callosal cells are smooth neurons of diverse dendritic morphology,
distributed widely throughout the subplate depth. They were classified into
four cell types according to the dendritic morphology: radially oriented,
horizontally oriented, multipolars, and inverted pyramids. These findings
extend to the human brain some of the evidence obtained in animals concerning
the development of the cerebral cortex, especially those that are relevant to
the formation of a transitory circuitry in the subplate.<p>

years later with a visual agnosia characterised by a combination of certain
aspects of associative and apperceptive agnosia. MRI then revealed a severe
encephalomalacia of the right temporal lobe and bilateral temporo-occipital
areas. This association is discussed in terms of a clinical and aetiological
relation between autistic disorder and visual agnosia.<p>

AB: Axon number in the splenium was examined at 15, 25 and 60 days of age in
male and female rats. The splenium (posterior fifth) of the corpus callosum was
found to contain the axons from the visual cortex at all three ages and was
extensively sampled with electron microscopy. Overall, there was a 15% decrease
in the total number of axons between postnatal day 15 and day 60 in both sexes.
The observed decrease in axon number between day 15 and 25 in both males and
females is consistent with Elberger's (A.J. Elberger, Transitory corpus
callosum axons projecting throughout developing rat visual cortex revealed by
DiI, Cereb. Cortex 4 (1994) 279-299) data which suggest that the pattern of
visual callosal projections in the rat visual cortex is not restricted to the
adult form until the fourth postnatal week. There was a further decrease in
axon number between day 25 and day 60 in females only such that by 60 days of
age, the total number of axons was equivalent between the sexes. Thus in the
rat splenium, males appear to attain the adult number of axons earlier than
females. These results also indicate that there is a sex difference in the
timing of axon withdrawal in the rat splenium, with axon withdrawal continuing
in females after it has ceased in males.<p>

AB: Interactive image guidance is now in routine use for open neurosurgical
procedures and has demonstrated patient benefits. However, freehand interactive
guidance is not an appropriate replacement for the traditional frame-based
stereotactic procedures of biopsy, electrode placement, and functional
lesioning. These point-based procedures require precise target localization and
direct instrument guidance to avoid collateral brain injury. To perform true
frameless stereotactic procedures requires a guide that is also adjustable for
positioning, lockable, and adaptable to multiple instruments. We describe such
a device, which is employed for the guidance of biopsy needles, shunts,
electrodes, and endoscopes during neuronavigation. The method of frameless
stereotactic biopsy retrieval with an infrared-based neuronavigation system is
described, clinical results are given, and further areas of application
discussed.<p>

AB: It has been previously reported that neonatal monocular enucleation in rats
and hamsters induces the development of an anomalous band of callosal
connections in the middle of area 17 (primary visual cortex) in the hemisphere
ipsilateral to the remaining eye. In order to determine whether this effect is
due to elimination of retinal activity in one eye, we used the anatomical
tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to study the pattern of visual callosal
connections in rats in which retinal activity had been blocked by intraocular
injections of tetrodotoxin during the first two weeks of life. We found that
the callosal pattern in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the eye not treated with
tetrodotoxin was not distinguishable from the pattern present in normal rats.
In particular, we did not observe the anomalous extra band of callosal
connections that occurs in area 17 in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the
remaining eye in monocularly enucleated rats. These results indicate that
blockade of retinal activity in one eye is not sufficient to cause the marked
changes in the pattern of visual callosal connections that are induced by
neonatal monocular enucleation.<p>

AB: In this study we analyzed the effect of neonatal monocular enucleation on
the pattern of callosal connections in striate cortex of the golden hamster.
Callosal connections were revealed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the
remaining eye following multiple injections of either the enzyme horseradish
peroxidase or the fluorescent tracer Fluoro-Gold into the contralateral
hemisphere. The most salient anomaly induced by the removal of one eye at birth
is the appearance of a dense band of callosal connections that runs
anteroposteriorly in medial portions of striate cortex. No obvious changes in
the laminar distribution of callosal connections were observed. Comparison of
our present results with those obtained by Olavarria et al (1987) in
monocularly enucleated rats reveals that neonatal enucleation induces
remarkably similar anomalies in the callosal patterns of rats and hamsters.
This similarity suggests that the role the eyes play in the development of the
visual callosal pathway is similar among rodent species. Moreover, the finding
of an anomalous callosal band in striate cortex one-eyed hamsters supports the
notion that disruption of visual input does not arrest callosal development,
but rather leads to the development of entirely new features in the callosal
pattern.<p>

AB: We have previously shown that
(RS)-2-amino-2-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-4-yl)acetic acid (ATAA) is an
antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and
(RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA)
receptors. We have now resolved ATAA via diastereomeric salt formation using
N-BOC protected ATAA and (R)- and (S)-phenylethylamine. Enantiomeric purities
(ee &gt; 98%) of (R)- and (S)-ATAA were determined using the Crownpak CR(-) and
CR(+) columns, respectively. The absolute configuration of (R)-ATAA was
established by an X-ray crystallographic analysis of the (R)-phenylethylamine
salt of N-BOC-(R)-ATAA. Like ATAA, neither (R)- nor (S)-ATAA significantly
affected (IC50 &gt; 100 microM) the receptor binding of tritiated AMPA, kainic
acid, or (RS)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid, the latter
being a competitive NMDA antagonist. Electrophysiological experiments, using
the rat cortical wedge preparation, showed the NMDA antagonist effect as well
as the AMPA antagonist effect of ATAA to reside exclusively in the
(R)-enantiomer (Ki = 75 +/- 5 microM and 57 +/- 1 microM, respectively).
Neither (R)- nor (S)-ATAA significantly reduced kainic acid-induced excitation
(Ki &gt; 1,000 microM).<p>

AB: X-linked hydrocephalus, MASA syndrome and certain forms of X-linked spastic
paraplegia and agenesis of corpus callosum are now known to be due to mutations
in the gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (19, 30). As a result,
these syndromes have recently been reclassified as CRASH syndrome, an acronym
for Corpus callosum hypoplasia, Retardation, Adducted thumbs, Spasticity and
Hydrocephalus (8). A comparison of existing case reports with molecular genetic
analysis reveals a striking correlation between the type of mutation in the
L1CAM gene and the severity of the disease. Mutations that produce truncations
in the extracellular domain of the L1 protein are more likely to produce severe
hydrocephalus, grave mental retardation or early death than point mutations in
the extracellular domain or mutations affecting only the cytoplasmic domain of
the protein. While less severe than extracellular truncations, point mutations
in the extracellular domain do produce more severe neurologic problems than
mutations in just the cytoplasmic domain.<p>

studied. Anterior callosotomy was performed in 27 patients, total two-stage
callosotomy was performed in 8 patients and 1 patient had only posterior
callosotomy. We found mutism in 10 patients (2 after complete callosotomy and 8
after anterior section). The patients did not speak, but the comprehension was
present: they were able to carry out orders and to write. Their attitude to the
environment was characterized by complete indifference. The mutism was always
transient, lasting from 4 to 25 days (mean 7 days). Regression of mutism was
always complete. We think that this complication should be chiefly attributed
mainly to surgical manipulation, even if it is impossible to completely exclude
a multi-factorial etiology.<p>

AB: In 36 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy submitted to anterior
callosotomy (27 cases), to two-stage total callosotomy (8 cases) and to
posterior callosotomy (1 case) the EEG variations concerning background
activity, focal activity and sharp-waves (SW) bisynchronous activity were
evaluated. EEG modifications observed after callosotomy are the following:
background rhythm tends to be better organised as spectral analysis
demonstrated, this finding usually coincide with reduction of bisynchronous
discharges. It appears that improvement in background activity cannot be
correlated with outcome, but it seems to be to some extent since at the same
time cognitive functions also seem to improve; however, this last aspect need
to be checked in much larger series. The number and location of EEG foci do not
change, but they appear to be more active; this is likely to depend only on the
concomitant reduction of bisynchronous activity. No correlation seems to exist
between the number and the location of foci, which are generally multiple.
Lateralization of bisynchronous discharges as well as the reduction of their
frequency and duration were observed. However, the clinical course is quite
different: in some patients we have achieved good clinical responses in others
postoperative results were poor. Lateralization of bisynchronous discharges is
never absolute, on the grounds that in prolonged recordings bisynchronous
discharges are nearly always present. Bisynchronous discharges in some cases
are alternatively predominant in both hemispheres even within minutes or
seconds. It was observed that after certain time, generally some months,
lateralized discharges tend to generalize again, confirming that corpus
callosum is replaced in discharge diffusion by other structures (brain-stem,
diencephalon).<p>

AB: The callosotomy on drug-resistant epileptic seizures may abolish or reduce
their frequency and may modified the morphology of different kind of seizures.
Our series is composed of 36 patients. Drop-attacks and complex partial
seizures (CP) were present in all patients, generalized tonic-clonic seizures
(GTC) in 16 (44.4%) and simple partial seizures (SP) and myoclonic attacks (MY)
in 6 patients each. We found two kinds of modifications: a) lateralization of
hypotonia which becomes hemisomatic, with lateral bending to the hypotonic
side; b) different way of falling, due not only to the lateralization of
hypotonia but also to the gradual impairment of muscle tone. Modifications in
CP mainly concerned automatisms, which disappeared in 39.1% of patients, while
34.8% of them had a significant reduction in automatisms; this reduction
consisted in simplification of automatic movements and in shorter duration of
seizures.<p>

AB: Sixty-five patients with lesions affecting the third ventricle (54
patients) or the corpus callosum itself (11 patients) underwent partial
callosotomy or a circumscribed callosal resection. Before the surgery 20
patients were studied using the battery of cognitive, affective and behavioural
tests which was repeated 10 and 100 days after surgery. No disconnection
syndrome was over observed after the partial commissurotomy. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation over the sensorimotor cortex was performed in 10 patients
to determine conduction time of callosal fibres by measuring inhibition of
tonic voluntary electromyographic activity in muscle's ipsilateral to the
activated hemisphere. It was found that this inhibition was absent in patients
with lesions of the trunk of the corpus callosum and present in patients with
lesions of the genu or splenium. In addition magnetic resonance imaging
measurements of the corpus callosum were performed in 40 normal subjects to
establish a classification system for corpus callosal area. The results showed
a wide variability of the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum. The
comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum lead to a categorisation
according to the presence and location of depressions on its surface.<p>

AB: The effect of corpus callosotomy on cognitive functioning, social
adjustment and motor behavior was studied in 25 pediatric patients. In order to
assess age-related differences in cerebral adjustment, the sample was divided
into two groups, one group operated on before and the other after the age of 13
years. Pre- and postoperative data were collected from all patients by means of
standardized neuropsychological tests. When possible, the children were also
submitted to simple interhemispheric transfer tasks in the tactile modality.
Results revealed that all patients benefited from the callosotomy, regardless
of their age and their mental capacities at the time of the surgery. The
greatest improvements were observed in social adjustment. Generally,
neuropsychological outcome paralleled neurological outcome. In keeping with the
plasticity hypothesis, the young group showed greater gains than the older
group. The latter showed similar sequelae as the adult split-brain patients
described in the literature. Number of years of uncontrolled seizures was not
related to neuropsychological outcome. Higher IQ was associated with better
outcome in the young group, mainly because this group was more severely
retarded and had more to gain from the surgery than the older group. However,
mental retardation should not be an exclusion criterion for corpus callosotomy
in view of the potential benefit of the surgery for the patient and his/her
family.<p>

AB: Neuropsychological changes following corpus callosotomy depend on the
degree of the callosal section, the portion sectioned and the patient's age at
the time of the surgery. Anterior section frequently results in transient
hemiparesis of the non-dominant leg and temporary difficulties in initiating
speech. Posterior section is followed by disconnection symptoms in the sensory
modalities which can be demonstrated when input is lateralized and one
hemisphere is denied access to the information received by the other. Visual
and tactile stimuli presented to the non-dominant hemisphere are no longer
verbally identified due to disconnection from the language-dominant hemisphere.
Total callosotomy additionally interrupts interhemispheric communication
between the motor regions. This results in deficits in bimanual coordination
and apraxia of the non-dominant hand to verbal commands. Some of the symptoms
subside, probably due to increased use of ipsilateral sensory and motor
pathways. Others are permanent. However, they are not disabling since
unrestricted scanning of the environment ensures bilateral representation of
sensory experience. Cognitive functions are frequently improved, although
preexisting lateralized deficits may be exacerbated. Learning of new material
is difficult for some patients with lateralized temporal lobe dysfunction in
whom interhemispheric compensation is abolished by the surgery. Language
deficits are observed mainly in patients with crossed dominance. Studies in
children reveal that callosotomy performed before puberty is not followed by
permanent disconnection deficits. This may be attributable to the greater
neural plasticity of the immature brain.<p>

AB: The effectiveness of callosotomy to the control of medically intractable
epilepsy is still discussed fifty years after the first reported cases.
Nevertheless patient selection, type of seizures and epileptic syndromes are
now better determined. Atonic and tonic astatic seizures characterized both by
clinical and electroencephalographical specific patterns, are the most
responsive. A favorable outcome, from &gt; 50% reduction in seizure frequency
to a complete cessation, is obtained from 60 to 80% of the patients. For
tonic-clonic seizures, favorable outcome fluctuates from 40% to 80% principally
according to the extension of the section. Other types of seizures are not
indicated for callosotomy even though some improvement may be observed.
Symptomatic secondary generalized epilepsy with predominent unilateral lesion
and epileptic focus on bifrontal lobe epilepsy are the most suitable
indication. True generalized epilepsies are associated with a less favorable
outcome. Indeed, axial spasms, the most frequent type of drop attacks in the
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, probably do not have a cortical origin. Quality of
life and social adjustment are assessed from a cohort of 20 cases of anterior
two-third callosotomy. Actual benefits are in close connection with both
seizure relief and age at operation. To obtain a gain in social independence
not only seizure control has to be better but also surgery must be performed
sooner.<p>

AB: A series of 34 patients with tumours of the third ventricle were operated
on by a transcallosal route. Basal extrinsic lesions compressing or invading
the ventricle as well as tumours located in the pineal area were excluded from
this review. Tumours were approached by a transforaminal entry in 16 cases
(47%), by an interforniceal route in 11 (32%), by a subchoroidal entry in 4
(14%) and by a combined transforaminal and subchoroidal entry in 3 (9%). Four
out of 34 patients were submitted to a second operation, through the same
approach corridor: 2 for an incomplete removal of an intrinsic tumour and 2 for
a late regrowth. Postoperative mortality rate accounted for 5.8% (2 patients).
Major post operative complications were hemiparesis (4 patients) and diabetes
insipidus (4 patients), that were transient in 3. Akinetic mutism like status
was observed in only 1 patient. Postoperative psychic disturbances were noticed
in 5 cases. Nine out of 21 patients (62%) with preoperative hydrocephalus
required a permanent CSF shunt. Histology revealed that 21 tumours (62%) were
intraaxial (4 pilocitic astrocytoma, 10 low grade glioma, 1 giant cell
astrocytoma, 1 subependymoma, 4 ependymoma/ependymoblastoma, 1 neurocitoma) and
13 (38%) were extraaxial (8 colloid cyst, 2 craniopharingioma, 1 ectopic
pituitary adenoma, 1 lymphocytic hypophysitis and 1 metastasis). Total excision
of third ventricle tumours was achieved in all patients with extraaxial tumours
and in 62% and 71% of intraaxial tumours with the first and second surgical
procedure respectively. Ten out of 34 patients of this series were submitted to
a complete neuropsychological evaluation at an interval of 2-9 years after
surgery. Memory tests were pathological in 2. Disconnection signs were
constantly absent. Control function were preserved. Transcallosal approach
remains the best microsurgical method of third ventricle tumours treatment.
This route provides the capability for a superior visualization of the entire
cavity of the third ventricle through different corridors. Permanent
neurological and neuropsychological deficits are not frequent. Epilepsy, that
accounted for 28% in patients submitted to transcortical transventricular
approach to third ventricle tumours, was never noticed in this series operated
on through a transcallosal route.<p>

callosotomy. The 25 patients were affected by severe epilepsy with invalidating
generalized seizures with fall, lacking of indication for ablative surgery.
Nineteen patients, with at least 1 year of follow-up, were considered for this
study. The surgical outcome was classified as: class A), seizure disappearance;
class B) 80%, class C) 80-50%, class D) less than 50% seizure reduction; E)
increase of seizure frequency. The follow-up analysis shows that the better
results are obtained with the generalized seizures, in particular the GTA. Our
surgical results are discussed considering the data of the literature: about
the functional anatomy of the Corpus Callosum, the experimental studies and the
clinical series published on callosotomized epileptic patients.<p>

were submitted to anterior callosotomy, 1 to posterior callosotomy and the
remaining 8 patients to two stage complete division of corpus callosum. All
factors, either positive or negative, do not appear completely reliable; they
can be envisaged only in relative terms and do not seem to be relevant to make
surgical decision or to discard surgery. In author's series, dealing
specifically with drop-attacks, it clearly appeared that abrupt falls to the
ground unpreceded by other epileptic features did definitely better. This was

AB: The authors briefly summarize the experimental papers dealing with the role
of corpus callosum in experimental epileptogenesis published over more than
half a century. On the whole, the experimental work concerns more
electro-encephalographic findings than epileptic manifestations in animals. The
papers taken into account are classified in two main groups: I) positive
findings supporting the efficacy of callosotomy in preventing generalization of
initially localized seizures. II) papers failing to demonstrate any positive
effect of commissurotomy on the generalization of discharges. On these grounds,
experimental studies lack of homogeneity and cannot constitute a reliable basis
for making surgical decision in clinical practice. However some remarks of
practical use can be derived: a) the usefulness of the corpus callosum division
for the management of secondarily generalized epilepsies appears to be
sufficiently demonstrated in most studies; b) then is also evidence that the
corpus callosum conveys inhibitory and/or suppressive stimuli as well, the
practical value of which is still to be established; d) the corpus callosum is
the most important but not the only anatomic structure for spreading seizures.
Anterior and posterior commissures, thalamus, tegmentum tectum may play the
same role.<p>

AB: The anatomical and histological structure of Corpus callosum is analysed,
mainly in relation with cell composition and fibre distribution. The
vascularization of Corpus callosum is analyzed in relation with the
distribution of the supplying arteries and the fine organization of small
vessels. The first part of the presentation deals with damages of corpus
callosum as a consequence of hemorrhagic and ischemic vasculopathies. The
lesions may be direct or indirect; the latter follow the distruction of
hemispheric areas interconnecting through the corpus callosum or occur as the
product of reduced flow in the territories of carotid and vertebral arteries. A
special mention is dedicated to the anatomoclinical syndromes developing after
damages to the anterior or posterior section of Corpus callosum. The second
part deals with specific diseases such as Marchiafava-Bignami's disease, which
is treated as an example of glial cell pathology and chronic edema. The third
part deals with tumors. Besides lymphomas which need a separate consideration
for their modality of growth, neuroepithelial tumors are discussed. The most
important problem is that of invasion through the Corpus callosum. The cell
traffic in this structure with all the connected questions about cell
migration, adhesiveness and motility are presented. Pathology of Corpus
callosum is extended also to anatomically related median structures such as
fornix and septum pellucidum. The latter is one of the principal pathways of
diffusion in gliomas.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: The transcallosal route has been propagated as a safe approach
to midline tumors. The present study was performed in order to elucidate the
neurobehavioral late sequelae in patients after transcallosal microsurgery on
near-midline tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The present study was performed
retrospectively with a delay between surgery and follow-up examination ranging
from 2 to 36 months (mean 10.2 months). SETTING: The study was performed in the
Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of the University of Technology
(RWTH) Aachen, Germany. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 18 patients treated
for an intracranial lesion by transcallosal surgery was included into the
study. The patients had to be not younger than 16 and not older than 67 years.
The age mean was 38.9 years (range 16 to 65 years). INTERVENTIONS: The surgical
approach was performed along the falx cerebi under microneurosurgical
conditions with direct use of the microscope after opening the dura. MEASURES:
Beyond neurological examinations, the patients were submitted to an extensive
neuropsychological testing battery. Furthermore, quality of life was examined
by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS: Surgery was performed without persistent
new neurological deficits. Cognitive deficits were found in short- and
long-term memory, motor fine-coordination, reaction time, divided attention and
fronto-cortical capacity. The quality of life was particularly impaired in the
area of cognitive capacity in daily life. These findings could be related to
the duration of preoperative symptoms and to the tumor location. CONCLUSIONS:
The deficits found cannot be explained by surgical damage to the corpus
callosum itself. Rather, they seem to correspond to an extra-callosal
pathology. Further studies with a prospective evaluation of larger patient
samples are called for in the future.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: Thirteen patients with neoplasm of anterior corpus callosum have
undergone our observation during the last two years. METHODS: For the
diagnosis, all the patients underwent TC, NMR and stereotactic biopsy. In 6
cases with glioblastomas, a radiation treatment was adopted. The other 7
patients underwent total surgical treatment in 5 cases, and partial in 2 cases,
as documented by postoperative contrast-enhanced CT scanning. Histologically,
there were: 3 glioblastomas, 1 grade III astrocytoma, 1 neuroblastoma (PNET), 2
pilocytic astrocytomas. RESULTS: Neuropsychological tests carried out on the 5
patients still living showed persistent disturbances of verbal memory in all
five and disturbances of verbal phonological fluency in 3 cases. No patient
presented apraxia, dysgraphia and dyslexia. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, no severe
neuropsychological deficits developed after surgical treatment of anterior
callosal tumors.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To study the after-effects of a selective lesion of the corpus
callosum on the capacity in transferring spatial information on arm posture
derived from kinesthesia and vision. DESIGN: Neuropsychological and
psychophysical evaluations of a patient with callosal damage. SETTING:
Institute of Neurology, University of "Tor Vergata", Rome, Italy and Research
Centre, IRCCS "S. Lucia", Rome, Italy. PATIENT: P.V., a 59 years old man
suffering from a vascular lesion of the left half of corpus callosum and left
callosal radiations. MEASURES: Sensori-motor and cognitive tasks. Exo- and
egocentric pointing abilities tasks. RESULTS: Impairments due to a
disconnection between the two cerebral hemispheres were pointed out. About
pointing abilities, errors were greater when each hand pointed to the
remembered location of the other hand. Errors decreased dramatically with eyes
open for right hand pointing to remembered location of left and right hand, and
left hand pointing to remembered location of left hand. Open eyes left hand
pointing to remembered location of right hand remained as poor as with eyes
closed. CONCLUSIONS: The results appear compatible with the following network:
visual information from striate and extrastriate cortex is passed forward to
parietal cortex bilaterally (even in PV due to the splenium sparing).
Kinesthetic information from parietal cortex of left and right hemisphere
converge on a single visuokinesthetic center, lateralized to the left
hemisphere. Information about limb position in three-dimensional space is then
encoded in body-centered coordinates and passed forward to motor and premotor
cortex in the frontal lobe. These frontal regions are those disconnected in
PV.<p>

AB: Diffusion anisotropy was investigated in the developing rat brain
[postnatal day (P)6-29] with the use of ion-selective microelectrodes to
measure the three-dimensional distribution of tetramethylammonium (TMA+)
iontophoresed into the extracellular space (ECS). The diffusion parameters, ECS
volume fraction alpha (alpha = ECS volume/total tissue volume), tortuosity
lambda (lambda2 = apparent diffusion coefficient/free diffusion coefficient),
and nonspecific TMA+ uptake (k'), were studied in cortical gray matter (layer
V) and corpus callosum (CC) of anesthetized rats. ECS volume fraction in cortex
and CC was about twice as large in the newborn rat as in adults. In this study,
more detailed analysis revealed that alpha in CC gradually decreased from P4,
when alpha ranged between 0.42 and 0.45, and reached a final value of 0.26 +/-
0.01 (SE, n = 12 measurements, 6 animals) at about P21. Diffusion in the ECS of
CC was isotropic until about P12, i.e., there was no significant difference in
the tortuosity factor, lambda, between the three perpendicular axes. From P13
to P17 anisotropy greatly increased as a result of preferential diffusion along
the myelinated axons (X-axis). At P21-23 the tortuosity values were lambda(x) =
1.46 +/- 0.03, lambda(y) = 1.70 +/- 0.01, and lambda(z) = 1.72 +/- 0.02 (n =
12), and there were no further changes up to the last postnatal day studied,
P29. In contrast to the myelinated CC, cortical gray matter remained isotropic
up to P29, with a tortuosity of 1.54 +/- 0.02 (n = 12). The results suggest
that diffusion anisotropy in the rat CC is related to myelination; it reaches a
maximum at P17, when myelination is well advanced. In myelinated pathways,
preferential diffusion of ions and transmitters occurs along the axons. These
results are relevant to volume transmission and the interpretation of
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.<p>

AB: Motor cortical (MC) kindling was carried out in 12 adult cats, seven with
the corpus callosum (CC) intact and five with the CC bisected, to study
interhemispheric transfer effects and the effect of callosal bisection on both
seizure development and interhemispheric transfer effects. MC kindling
developed from partial motor seizures to partial onset generalized convulsions.
Interhemispheric negative transfer effect, but not positive, existed in
secondary site kindling and primary site retest of the CC-intact group, as
shown by: (i) electroencephalographically lateralized seizure development in
the stimulated hemisphere; (ii) delayed generalization of partial onset
generalized convulsions; and (iii) a markedly unstable generalized convulsive
seizure state. The CC-bisected group showed: (i) significantly delayed seizure
development from partial motor seizure stage to generalized convulsive seizure
stage in primary and secondary kindling; (ii) facilitated intrahemispheric
seizure development; (iii) the diminution of interhemispheric negative transfer
effect; (iv) modified generalized convulsions showing extremely asymmetrical
generalized convulsions shifting from contralaterally dominant convulsions to
ipsilaterally dominant ones (n = 2) or alternate generalized convulsions
changing from contralateral hemiconvulsions to ipsilateral ones (n = 3). The
results obtained suggest that the CC plays a major role in interhemispheric
seizure propagation as well as interhemispheric negative transfer effects in MC
kindling and may have suppressive effect on intrahemispheric motor seizure
development in MC kindling. However, interhemispheric seizure propagation and
interhemispheric negative transfer effects were mediated via other structures,
possibly subcortical structures, when the CC was bisected.<p>

AB: We hypothesized that hydrocephalus in young animals could cause a delay in
myelination. Hydrocephalus was induced in 3-week-old rats by injecting kaolin
into the cisterna magna. Ventricular size was assessed by magnetic resonance
imaging. After 1 to 4 weeks, rats were either sacrificed, or treated by
diversionary shunting of cerebrospinal fluid and then sacrificed 3 to 4 weeks
later. Samples of corpus callosum/supraventricular white matter, fimbria,
medulla, and spinal cord were assayed for myelin-related enzyme activities
including p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phosphocholine phosphodiesterase
(PNPCP), glycerophosphocholine phosphocholine phosphodiesterase (GPCP), and
2',3'-cyclic neucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), and the oligodendrocyte
enzyme UDP-galactose, ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGa1T). Myelin basic
protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) were assayed in cerebrum by
immunoblots and Northern blot. The corpus callosum was processed for electron
microscopy and myelin thickness to axon diameter ratios were quantified. One
week after induction of hydrocephalus, CGa1T and GPCP activity were reduced in
the corpus callosum there was less MBP and PLP in the cerebrum, and myelin
sheaths around axons greater than 0.4 micron in diameter were abnormally thin.
With persistent hydrocephalus, the corpus callosum became thinned, axons were
lost, and myelin-related enzyme activities and proteins were decreased.
Treatment of hydrocephalus at 1 week largely prevented the damage while
shunting at 4 weeks failed to restore the injured white matter. Early reduction
in CGa1T activity in the medulla and spinal cord suggest that oligodendrocyte
production of myelin was reduced, even before irreversible damage occurred in
the corticospinal tracts. We conclude that hydrocephalus in the immature rat
brain delays myelination, but compensatory myelination is possible if treatment
is instituted prior to the development of axonal injury. Possible mechanisms of
oligodendrocyte impairment are discussed.<p>

AB: The neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) is a transmembrane
glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is essential in
the development of the nervous system. It is mainly expressed on neurons and
Schwann cells, and plays a key role in axon outgrowth and pathfinding through
interactions with various extracellular ligands and intracellular second
messenger systems. Mutations in L1 are responsible for a wide spectrum of
neurologic abnormalities and mental retardation. This spectrum includes
X-linked hydrocephalus, MASA syndrome, X-linked complicated spastic paraplegia
type 1 and X-linked agenesis of the corpus callosum. These four diseases were
initially described as distinct clinical entities with an overlapping clinical
spectrum, but can now be lumped into one syndrome caused by mutations in the L1
gene. The main clinical features of this spectrum are Corpus callosum
hypoplasia, mental Retardation, Adducted thumbs, Spastic paraplegia and
Hydrocephalus, which has led to the acronym CRASH syndrome.<p>

AB: We report evidence of isolated conceptual knowledge in the right hemisphere
of a woman with chronic anarchic hand sign after ischemic infarction of the
central four-fifths of the corpus callosum. Limited visual information was
available to the right hemisphere, access to medial temporal structures
subserving memory was disrupted and disconnection from left hemisphere language
structures was complete. Still, the right hemisphere could build mental
representations of objects via tactile input and use them in cross-modal
matching. These representations were not accessed consistently in auditory
comprehension or naming tasks. This functional specificity and its
pathoanatomical correlates demonstrate that the study of anarchic hand sign can
illuminate not just motor control issues but may inform our understanding of
the representation and lateralization of conceptual knowledge as well.<p>

AB: Aicardi syndrome is a developmental disorder characterised by agenesis of
the corpus callosum, retinal lacunae, seizures, and developmental delay. It is
believed to be X linked with lethality in males. We report a set of monozygotic
female twins one of whom is healthy and intellectually normal while the other
has the classical Aicardi phenotype with profound retardation. Family history
is negative. Both had normal karyotypes. Monozygosity was established by blood
grouping, chromosomal heteromorphisms, and DNA analysis using six hypervariable
probes (five autosomal and one X linked) and three X linked RFLP probes. We
tested the hypothesis that preferential inactivation of a different X
chromosome had occurred in each girl. Methylation sensitive RFLP analysis of
DNA from EBV transformed B lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts using
MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27 beta showed a very similar pattern of
X inactivation in both twins with no evidence of preferential expression of one
particular X chromosome. We conclude that the abnormalities in the affected
twin are probably the consequence of a postzygotic mutation in early embryonic
development.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
(MR) features of corpus callosum (CC) infarctions. METHODS: We reviewed
retrospectively 352 consecutive cranial CT and MR scans showing cerebral
infarcts. Involvement of the CC was identified in 28 patients. RESULTS:
Infarctions of the CC were diffuse (n = 3) or focal (n = 25). The former were
seen in the setting of diffuse cerebral ischemia secondary to cardiopulmonary
arrest or status epilepticus. The latter were divided into those affecting
predominantly the genu, body or splenium. The most common location of the
insult was the splenium (n = 13), followed by the body (n = 6) and genu (n =
3). In the remaining three patients combined genu/body infarctions were seen.
CONCLUSION: Infarction of the CC may be more common than previously thought and
is most often the result of cerebral embolism. MR is better suited than CT for
the detection of vascular lesions of the CC.<p>

AB: The corpus callosum plays a role in mediating interhemisphere
communication. Coherence may be a quantitative EEG-based measure of this
communication. The present report is of a female schizophrenic patient with a
marked coherence deficit in the temporal-parietal-occipital region involving
multiple frequency bands. An MRI scan of her brain revealed a lipoma involving
the splenium of the corpus callosum. It is speculated that this lipoma may have
caused a physical impingment on or developmental aberration of adjacent
callosal fibers, resulting in the observed coherence deficit. Further studies
of coherence measures in patients with collosal lipomas are proposed.<p>

AB: BACKGROUND: The relationship between midline structural defects and
schizophrenia remains unclear, although a number of neuroradiological studies
have reported an association between schizophrenia and a range of anomalies.
METHOD: Three patients are reported, each diagnosed with schizophrenia and
neuroradiological evidence of midline structural anomalies. MRI scans are
reported in conjunction with performance over a range of neuropsychological
tests designed to assess frontal and lateralised cognitive functions. RESULTS:
Evidence of anterior dysfunction was present in all three cases, while on an
individual basis patients displayed varying patterns of preserved and
dysfunctional cognitive processing. CONCLUSION: The reported findings raise a
number of interesting issues regarding the nature of hemispheric involvement in
schizophrenia.<p>

AB: Agenesis of corpus callosum is an uncommon brain malformation that is
usually detected in childhood. In adult, focal epileptic seizure is the most
frequent manifestation. Otherwise, asymptomatic patients can be detected by
cerebral imagery with specific criteria. Neither developmental disability nor
interhemispheric transfer dysfunction are observed in those patients. Minor
facial abnormalities can be found. Agenesis of corpus callosum in adult is
usually paucisymptomatic. The prognosis depends on cerebral associated
malformations which are involved in epilepsy and cognitive disturbances.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Focal or diffuse corpus callosal changes can
occur in patients with active hydrocephalus who undergo shunting procedures.
The neural compression caused by active hydrocephalus and the conditions that
follow ventricular shunting may contribute to the development of these changes.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two patients who underwent successful shunting for
hydrocephalus subsequently developed thickening and diffuse signal changes in
the corpus callosum, which were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging. The
abnormal signal intensity extended laterally and linearly along the callosal
fiber tracts and was not associated with mass effect. These changes persisted
despite clinical improvement after the shunts were implanted. INTERVENTION:
Detailed neuropsychological testing showed no evidence of residual cognitive
impairment or any interruption of the interhemispheric transfer of information.
It has been proposed that the impingement of the corpus callosum by the rigid
falx may contribute to symptomatic hydrocephalus. Impingement may cause partial
hemispheric disconnection, resulting from callosal axonal dysfunction. Our
patients showed radiographic evidence of dramatic changes within the corpus
callosum after ventricular shunting, consistent with a transcallosal
demyelinating process. Patients demonstrated neither clinical nor
neuropsychological evidence of callosal disconnection, even though the callosal
changes persisted. In these two patients, it is reasonable to assume that the
relative sparing of the splenium accounts for the lack of neuropsychological
deficits. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, conservative management, rather
than a stereotactic biopsy or other forms of intervention, seems reasonable
when these characteristic changes of the callosum are noted by magnetic
resonance imaging after a shunt for hydrocephalus has been implanted in the
patient.<p>

AB: The present study examined sex differences in the area and age-related
atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) of 76 healthy elderly subjects using
magnetic resonance imaging. The cerebellum and pons served as noncortical
control structures. CC area and its subregions were also related to cognitive
performance. Women had a slightly larger posterior sector of the CC than men.
Women but not men showed age-related atrophy of the anterior and middle sectors
of the CC but not the posterior sector. Cerebellum and pons size was similar in
men and women, and neither showed age-related atrophy. CC area was related to
visual memory in women but not men; no other significant cognitive to structure
area relationships were found. These findings show that selective age related
atrophy of the CC differs in men and women late in life.<p>

AB: A number of 3-isoxazolol bioisosteres, 7a-i, of (S)-glutamic acid (Glu), in
which the methyl group of
(RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA, 1) was
replaced by different 5-membered heterocyclic rings, were synthesized.
Comparative in vitro pharmacological studies on this series of AMPA analogues
were performed using receptor binding assays (IC50 values) and the
electrophysiological rat cortical slice model (EC50 values). None of these
compounds showed detectable affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subtype
of Glu receptors. Some of the compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H]kainic acid
binding. The inhibitory effects on [3H]AMPA binding and agonist potencies at
AMPA receptors of 7a-i were strictly dependent on the structure, electrostatic
potential, and methyl substitution of the heterocyclic 5-substituent. Thus,
while 7a (IC50 = 0.094 microM; EC50 = 2.3 microM) was approximately equipotent
with AMPA (IC50 = 0.023 microM; EC50 = 5.4 microM),
(RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)isoxazol-4-yl]propio nic acid
(7b) (IC50 = 48 microM; EC50 = 550 microM) was some 2 orders of magnitude
weaker than AMPA, and
(RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-isoxazol-4 -yl]
propionic acid (7c) (IC50 &gt; 100 microM; EC50 &gt; 1000 microM) was inactive.
Furthermore, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol
-4-yl] propionic acid (7i) (IC50 = 0.030 microM; EC50 = 0.92 microM) was more
potent than AMPA, whereas its N-1 methyl isomer,
(RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl]
propionic acid (7h) (IC50 = 54 microM; EC50 &gt; 1000 microM) was inactive as
an AMPA agonist. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis
revealed a positive correlation between receptor affinity, electrostatic
potential near the nitrogen atom at the "ortho" position of the heterocyclic
5-substituent, and the rotational energy barrier around the bond connecting the
two rings. We envisage that a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group
and an ortho-positioned heteroatom of the ring substituent at the 5-position
stabilize receptor-active conformations of these AMPA analogues.<p>

AB: The contribution of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors to excitatory subthreshold
receptive fields was examined in callosal efferent neurons (CC neurons) in
primary somatosensory cortex of the fully awake rabbit. Only neurons showing no
traditional (suprathreshold) receptive fields were examined. Subthreshold
responses were examined by monitoring the thresholds of efferent neurons to
juxtasomal current pulses (JSCPs) delivered through the recording
microelectrode. Changes in threshold following a peripheral conditioning
stimulus signify a subthreshold response. Using this method, excitatory
postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are manifested
as decreases and increases in JSCP threshold, respectively. NMDA and non-NMDA
agonists and antagonists were administered iontophoretically via a multibarrel
micropipette assembly attached to the recording/stimulating microelectrode.
Receptor-selective doses of both AMPA/kainate and NMDA antagonists decreased
the excitability of CC neurons in the absence of any peripheral stimulation.
Threshold to JSCPs rose by a mean of 20% for both classes of antagonist.
Despite the similar effects of NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists on baseline
excitability, these antagonists had dramatically different effects on the
subthreshold excitatory response to activation of the receptive field. Whereas
receptor-selective doses of AMPA/kainate antagonists either eliminated or
severely attenuated the subthreshold excitatory responses to peripheral
stimulation, NMDA antagonists had little or no effect on the subthreshold
evoked response.<p>

AB: The effect of callosotomy upon motor control by the cerebral cortex on the
forelimb was examined in the mouse. On the 10th day after callosotomy in the
rostral or caudal part of the corpus callosum, the forelimb area of the
cerebral motor cortex was stimulated intracortically with a microelectrode and
muscle contraction of the forelimb was recorded by electromyography. Muscle
contraction was observed in the contralateral forelimb in the mice of which
callosal fibers were cut in the caudal part of the corpus callosum including
the splenium corporis callosi as well as in the normal mice. On the other hand,
muscle contraction was observed in the ipsilateral forelimb in the mice of
which callosal fibers were incised in the rostral part of the corpus callosum
including the genu, rostrum and trunk. The latency of the muscle contraction
was about 0.5 msec in the both groups of the callosotomized mice, as well as in
the normal mice.<p>

AB: Serial CT and MR imaging findings in a 44-year-old woman with
Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) are reported. In the acute stage, CT studies
disclosed subtle hypodensity in the splenium, and T2-weighted MR images
revealed apparent high signal intensity of the splenium and the central portion
of the corpus callosum. Treatment with vitamin B complex resulted in complete
recovery. T2-weighted MR images obtained three weeks after admission revealed
dramatic resolution of imaging abnormalities, with only faint high signal
intensity remaining in the splenium. The sequential changes observed on CT and
MR images provided early diagnosis of MBD and the resolution of the lesion
considered as brain edema, which suggested that edema might, in addition to
demyelination or necrosis, be involved in the acute progression of MBD.<p>

AB: Aicardi syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by absent corpus
callosum, infantile spasms, and choriorentinal lacunae. It is sporadic in
nature and affects only females, resulting in severe mental and physical
handicap. It has been suggested that the disease is caused by a dominant
X-linked mutation which occurs de novo in females, and is lethal in hemizygous
male embryos. This mode of inheritance has been observed in a number of other
rare syndromes. In these syndromes, when X inactivation is studied, a
non-random pattern is usually found. We have studied the X inactivation pattern
in ten female patients with Aicardi syndrome and their parents using the highly
polymorphic, differentially methylated androgen receptor gene. The results
showed an unexpected random X-inactivation pattern in these patients. Previous
clinical and cytogenetic evidence suggests that Aicardi syndrome is caused by
an X-linked dominant mutation, de novo in females and lethal in males. However,
unlike most other known X-linked disorders inherited in this fashion, Aicardi
syndrome patients have a normal (i.e., random) X-inactivation pattern. A number
of possible explanations is proposed for this apparently contradictory
evidence.<p>

AB: Relatively few behavioral deficits are apparent in subjects with hereditary
absence of the corpus callosum (CC). The anterior commissure (AC) has been
suggested to provide an extracallosal route for the transfer of
interhemispheric information in subjects with this congenital defect. Anterior
commissure size, axon number, axon diameter, and neuronal distribution were
compared between normal mice and those with complete CC absence. No difference
in midsagittal AC area was found between normals and acallosals, nor were
differences found in the numbers or diameters of myelinated axons. However,
axon counts indicated an 17% increase or about 70,000 more unmyelinated axons
in the AC of acallosal mice, and the mean diameter of unmyelinated axons was
slightly less than in normal mice (0.24 vs 0.26 microm). This decrease in axon
diameter enabled more axons to pass through the AC without increasing its
midsagittal area. The topographical distribution of neurons sending axons
through the AC, assessed with lipophilic dyes, was qualitatively similar for
almost all the known regions of origin of the anterior commissure in normal and
acallosal mice. There was a pronounced deficit of AC cells in the anterior
piriform cortex of BALB/c mice, but this occurred whether or not the mouse
suffered absent CC.Although the increase in AC axon number is far smaller than
the number of CC axons that fail to reach the opposite hemisphere, the higher
number of axons present in the AC of acallosal mice may contribute to the
functional compensation for the loss of the CC.<p>

AB: We report three patients with selective topographic disorientation due to
small, focal hemorrhages extending from the right retrosplenial region to the
medial parietal lobe. All three could discriminate and identify familiar
buildings and landscapes, but had great difficulty remembering spatial
positional relationships between two distant locations (i.e., the direction
from one location to another) in familiar areas. These symptoms were different
than the perception and memory deficits for buildings and landscapes caused by
the medial temporo-occipital lesion. These findings suggest that the
directional orientation between two locations within a familiar area ("sense of
direction") is closely associated with the right retrosplenial region and the
medial parietal lobe in humans.<p>

syndrome (GTS) remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested abnormalities of
cerebral asymmetry and basal ganglia volumes. We studied 17 patients with GTS
and eight normal controls using volumetric MRI techniques for measuring the
caudate nucleus, amygdala, and corpus callosum. One subject with GTS was
subsequently excluded because he was left handed. No absolute differences in
caudate nucleus volumes between patient and control groups were evident. There
was an increase in corpus callosum (CC) cross-sectional area and a loss of the
normal asymmetry of the caudate nucleus in the patient group. A loss of the
normal correlation between cross-sectional area of the CC and whole brain index
(WBI) in the patient group also was found. The amygdala measurements had a poor
interrater reliability.<p>

AB: Lenz microphthalmia syndrome was first described by Lenz et al in 1955. The
cardinal features of the syndrome are microphthalmia or anophthalmos, narrow
shoulders, other skeletal anomalies, and dental and urogenital malformations.
Here we present a case of Lenz microphthalmia syndrome who shows the typical
characteristics and, additionally, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum associated
with dilatation of the lateral ventricles. The patient, a 13 year old male, was
referred to our hospital by a dental hospital for genetic counselling. On
physical examination, height, weight, and head circumference were below the 3rd
centile and he had brachymicrocephaly, a preauricular tag, microphthalmia,
missing teeth, narrow shoulders, long, proximally placed thumbs, hypospadias,
cryptorchidism, and a normal IQ. Ophthalmological examination showed
microcornea, sclerocornea, absence of the pupil, no vision in the left eye and
decreased vision and a small pupil in the right eye in addition to his
bilateral microphthalmia. Cranial MRI showed dilatation of the lateral
ventricles and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum.<p>

which they have named circular callosotomy. The operating device is the
original Riechert-Mundinger's string electrode, which can be protruded through
a side window and by rotating the probe it is possible to cut the commisural
pathways to the extent required. The anatomical results of the operation can be

AB: Brain structural deviation is known to be present in chronic patients with
schizophrenia when compared with normal age-matched individuals. While the
assumption is that these differences are based on a neurodevelopmental
disturbance, whether they are static or continue to change throughout the
disease process remains unknown. The following report describes a prospective
follow-up study of first episode cases of schizophrenic illness. Analyses of
MRI evaluations on an approximate annual basis for a minimum of four years are
presented on 50 patients and 20 controls. Computer-assisted image analysis
measuring the volume of several brain regions, using the program ANALYZE (Mayo
Clinic), was performed on all scans. Patients were compared with controls for
the rate of change over time in size of structures. No differences were found
for the volumes of the caudate nucleus, temporal lobes, or hippocampus; and no
changes in the degree of cerebral laterality were detected. However, there was
a significant difference in the rate of change in the overall volumes of left
and right hemispheres (P &lt; 0.0004 and 0.001, respectively), right cerebellum
(P &lt; 0.02) and area of the isthmus of the corpus callosum (P &lt; 0.05). The
left cerebral ventricle had significantly greater enlargement over time when
measured on coronal slice sequences (P &lt; 0.02), but was not detected by
axial views. These findings suggest that a subtle active brain process may be
continuing through the first few years of a schizophrenic illness causing
greater than the normal adult cortical deterioration. Further studies using
other methods of image analysis and over a longer period of time are needed to
determine the course and nature of this biologic process.<p>

AB: The aim of the present study was to assess the accuracy of various
measurements of the lateral ventricles (LVs) for the early prenatal diagnosis
of evolving congenital hydrocephalus. A prospective study was conducted among
61 normal pregnancies, and 20 pregnancies complicated by neural axis
malformations, between 19 and 24 weeks' gestation. The following ultrasound
measurements were obtained: atrial width (AW); atrial-width/cerebro-atrial
distance (CAD); left ventricular width/hemispheric distance, and
cerebro-frontal horn/hemispheric width (HW) distance. Atrial width or AW/CAD
had the highest diagnostic accuracy of 97.1% between 19-21 weeks; and 100%
between 22-24 weeks. The other two parameters had improved accuracy as
gestational age increased. However, between 19-21 weeks the other parameters
were below 90% in their diagnostic accuracy. These data demonstrate that the
simple measurement of the AW, used either singly or as a ratio with the CAD is
effective for the early prenatal diagnosis of evolving hydrocephalus.<p>

AB: Six normal subjects and a callosotomized man with a prefrontal lesion,
mostly on the right side, were tested in a reaction time (RT) task involving a
key-pressing response to an extrafoveal light target preceded by an extrafoveal
light cue. Cues and targets were presented along the horizontal meridian at 4
degrees and 12 degrees on the right and left of fixation. Fixation was
maintained throughout each trial. The cue signalled the occurrence of the
target within a time window extending from 200 to 4000 misec from the cue, but
did not predict target location. Normal controls responded faster to medial
than to lateral targets in both fields, but showed no between-field difference,
and their RT was not affected by cue location. Furthermore, they showed the
so-called 'ipsilateral inhibition' or 'inhibition of return' effect, their RT
being longer when cues and targets occurred in the same field than when they
occurred in opposite fields. The RT of the callosotomized subject showed a
left-right gradient for both cue location and target location, being longest
for the leftmost location and shortest for the right locations. In addition, he
showed a significant advantage for the right hand regardless of cue and target
location, as well as a consistent ipsilateral inhibition in the left field,
whereas in the right field there was ipsilateral inhibition only at the two
longest stimulus onset asynchronies. These results suggest that, at least under
these experimental conditions, there was a rightward orientational bias which
reflected the taking over of the control of performance by the left hemisphere.
This attentional bias was reminiscent of that seen in patients with
hemi-inattention from right hemisphere damage, although the callosotomized
patient showed no sign of such hemi-inattention in routine clinical tests. On
the basis of several considerations the rightward bias could be attributed to
the callosal interhemispheric disconnection rather than to the right prefrontal
lesion.<p>

splenium of the corpus callosum and retrosplenial region on the right side.
There was no aphasia or apraxia, but mild topographic disturbance was present.
Intelligence was normal, but amnesia was noted. Both verbal and visual memory
were disturbed equally. This case suggests that memory plays a role in the
right retrosplenial region.<p>

AB: INTRODUCTION: Peripheral neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum
(or Andermann's syndrome) is a hereditary autosomal recessive disorder rarely
found outside certain regions of Quebec Province (Canada). It is associated
with mental retardation and various dysmorphic changes. Deterioration is
usually progressive with loss of motor skills, development of scoliosis during
adolescence, tendency to behaviour disorders and death during the third decade
(approximately). CLINICAL CASE: We present a 13 year old girl diagnosed as
having the spastic tetraparesic type of PCI, who was sent to us so that we
could reconsider the diagnosis in view of the atypical course of the illness.
The patient had an unusual phenotype with dysmorphic changes (mainly facial),
axial hypotonia with flexion-retraction of the hands, generalized arreflexia,
neurogenic bladder, skin changes with ulcers on the legs and mental
retardation. Neurophysiological studies showed a predominantly motor
polyneuropathy. There were signs of axonal neuropathy on both sural nerve and
skeletal muscle biopsies. The clinical features, phenotype, microcephaly with
agenesis of the corpus callosum and a posterior fossa cyst, associated with
spinal atrophy indicated the diagnosis of Andermann's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS:
This case is of interest in view of the exceptional rarity of Andermann's
syndrome in our population.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To analyse clinical and outcome features of patients with mental
retardation and transient hypertonia in early life which lead to the diagnosis
of hypertonic cerebral palsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We study six patients that
presented with the above features in our neuropediatric out patients clinic.
Clinical data related with the hypertonic signs and its evolution were
collected. All the patients were assessed to find their present cognitive and
development state. RESULTS: Clinical and radiological signs of a possible
prenatal neurological damage were found in all the patients. Structural
anomalies were presented in neuroimaging in five cases. Agenesia or hypoplasia
of corpus callosum was the most common finding. The pattern of progression of
this cases were: 1. Improvement of hypertonia with almost normal tone by the
age of two years. 2. Despite of the resolution of motor signs, persistence of
different degrees of mental retardation. CONCLUSIONS: Our reported patients
presented a peculiar pattern of progression within the wide variability of the
cerebral palsy group.<p>

AB: In the mature cerebral cortex the interhemispheric connections across the
corpus callosum appear to be essentially completely excitatory on the basis of
both immunocytochemical and electrophysiological studies. During late embryonic
development, however, immunocytochemical staining reveals numerous
GABA-positive fibres in the callosum, which later largely disappear. The origin
of these fibres and whether they represent functional GABAergic neurons has not
been established. In the present study we used a combination of retrograde
labelling in vivo with electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry in cell
culture to show that transiently at birth in rat pups a substantial number of
transcallosal cortical cells are functional GABAergic neurons. Possible roles
and fates for these neurons are discussed.<p>

dementia. The area of the CC and seven distinct subdivisions were measured in
subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 162), multi-infarct dementia (MID)
(n = 28), and in a healthy comparison group (n = 36). There were significant
differences in the regional areas of the CC for both the AD and MID patients
relative to values for the comparison subjects. When mildly demented (MMSE &gt;
or = 21), subjects with AD had significantly smaller posterior midbody,
isthmus, and splenium and subjects with MID had significantly smaller genu
relative to comparison subjects. This study reports different patterns of
regional CC area loss in subjects with AD and MID.<p>

AB: Functional interactions between the two hemispheres were studied in adult
split-brain cats. The aims were to assess whether monocular learning developed
independently or that there were clues for interactions between the two sides
of the brain during acquisition of opposite learning tasks. Experimental cats
learned two visual pattern discriminations in which one pattern was positive
for the right eye, whereas the other pattern was positive for the left eye.
Control cats learned the same problems, but the same pattern was positive for
both eyes. The open eye was changed from one session to the next in both groups
of cats. In general, monocular performances of experimental cats were
asymmetrical because they learned better and faster with one eye than with the
other eye. Instead, no differences between the eyes were found in control cats.
Statistical analysis of the data indicated that learning in experimental cats
was significantly slower than learning in control cats, and that the difference
between monocular performances was significantly greater for the experimental
group than for the control group. The slower and asymmetrical monocular
learning of experimental cats may reflect a conflict and a competition between
the hemispheres for the control of learning behaviour, resulting in the
dominance of one of them. Thus, some information about the stimuli must have
been transmitted via the remaining interhemispheric connections. Symmetrical
monocular learning of control group indicated that the competition for the
control of behaviour was not present because there was no conflict between the
hemispheres.<p>

AB: GP, a right-handed woman, without evidence of familial left-handedness,
showed clearcut bilateral ideo-motor apraxia and oro-facial apraxia after a
vascular lesion of the right hemisphere, encroaching upon the fronto-mesial
region. She scored normally in most other cognitive tests, including language,
but showed signs of callosal disconnection, left anarchic hand and mild
unilateral spatial neglect. This cognitive profile points to the possibility of
praxis being localized to the right hemisphere in this right-handed patient. We
argue in favour of individual variability of praxis dominance, and maintain
that this dominance might be completely right-sided in some subjects. Moreover
the anatomical locus of GP's lesion points to the possible role that the
frontal lobes (and more specifically the Supplementary Motor Area) play in the
genesis of apraxia.<p>

AB: Three patients with mesial frontal and extensive callosal lesions due to
anterior cerebral artery infarction manifested an alien hand syndrome (AHS)
with varied features. Patient 1 with left hemispheric lesion showed right
hand's impulsive reaching and grasping and left hand's antagonistic movements
to the right (intermanual conflict; IMC). Patients 2 and 3 with right
hemispheric lesion manifested a left hemihypokinesia which was thought to have
suppressed the frequency and amplitude or even the occurrence of left hand's
reaching and grasping. IMC and other left hand's non-antagonistic, irrelevant
movements to the right remained. Because the term "IMC" is often misused and
not strictly defined, its association with right hand's reaching and grasping
is quite uncommon, its significance as a sign of callosal disconnection is not
well validated, and because left hand's reaching and grasping tend to be
suppressed by motor neglect, a trend may then develop for the right hand to be
the sole focus of pathological behaviour in patients with the so-called frontal
AHS (Feinberg, Schindler, Flanagan et al., 1992).<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the size of subregions
of the corpus callosum in autistic individuals. METHOD: The areas of three
subregions (anterior, body, and posterior) of the corpus callosum were examined
on midsagittal magnetic resonance images of 35 autistic subjects whose mean age
was 18 years and 36 healthy comparison subjects matched on age and IQ. RESULTS:
After controlling for total brain volume, gender, and performance IQ, the
authors detected a significantly smaller size of the body and posterior
subregions of the corpus callosum in the autistic individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In
the context of recent reports of increased brain size in autism, several
possible mechanisms are considered in exploring the significance of a smaller
relative size of the corpus callosum in autism.<p>

AB: We analysed the MRI findings in 23 patients with callosal dysgenesis in
relation to their associated telencephalic anomalies to investigate the
morphological significance of the development of Probst's bundles and the
anterior commissure in congenital callosal dysgenesis. We classified callosal
dysgenesis into three types: total defect (9 patients), partial defect (7) and
hypoplasia (7). Associated anomalies were observed in 15 patients, including
migration disorder (8 patients), micrencephaly (5), and lipoma (2). The
remaining 8 patients had no associated anomalies. Probst's bundles were not
identified in 4 patients with a severe migration disorder. An absent or
hypoplastic anterior commissure was observed in 9 of the 16 patients with
callosal defect and all 7 of those with callosal hypoplasia. Colpocephaly and
keyhole dilatation of the temporal horns were seen in 16 and 21 patients,
respectively. Callosal dysgenesis may occur not only through a defect in the
callosal anlage, but also from impaired growth of axonal fibres projecting from
the cerebral isocortex. Therefore, associated telencephalic anomalies may be
responsible for additional features in callosal dysgenesis. Consequently,
identification of Probst's bundles and the anterior commissure may be important
when assessing cortical development in patients with callosal dysgenesis.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: Using a fiber-dissection technique, our aim was to expose and
study the myelinated fiber bundles of the brain to achieve a clearer conception
of their configurations and locations. During the course of our study, the
superior occipitofrontal fasciculus became the focus of our interest. Many
publications have defined this as a bundle of association fibers, located
between the corpus callosum and the caudate nucleus, that connects the frontal
and occipital lobes. By examining this area using fiber dissection, we realized
that the descriptions of the anatomy are inadequate; thus, we focused on the
elucidation of the anatomic structures of this region and, in particular, that
known as the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus. METHODS: Twenty previously
frozen, formalin-fixed human brains were dissected under the operating
microscope using the fiber-dissection technique. RESULTS: On coronal sections
of the brain, a structure on the superolateral aspect of the caudate nucleus
usually has been identified as the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus.
However, our fiber dissections revealed that this structure is the superior
thalamic peduncle, that it is composed of projection fibers rather than
association fibers, and that it does not interconnect the occipital and frontal
lobes. CONCLUSION: The structures of the brain are better understood when the
fiber-dissection technique is used to explore their configurations and
locations. The resulting information is especially beneficial for planning
strategies and tactics of neurosurgical procedures.<p>

AB: Whole cell patch-clamp recordings of K+ currents from oligodendrocyte
precursors in 10-day-old rats (P10) and, following myelination, in mature
oligodendrocytes from 20-day-old rats (P20) were correlated with extracellular
space (ECS) diffusion parameters measured by the local diffusion of
iontophoretically injected tetramethylammonium ions (TMA+). The aim of this
study was to find an explanation for the changes in glial currents that occur
with myelination. Oligodendrocyte precursors (P10) in slices from corpus
callosum were characterized by the presence of A-type K+ currents, delayed and
inward rectifier currents, and lack of tail currents after the offset of a
voltage jump. Mature oligodendrocytes in corpus callosum slices from P20 rats
were characterized by passive, decaying currents and large tail currents after
the offset of a voltage jump. Measurements of the reversal potential for the
tail currents indicate that they result from increases in [K+]e by an average
of 32 mM during a 20 msec 100 mV voltage step. Concomitant with the change in
oligodendrocyte electrophysiological behavior after myelination there is a
decrease in the ECS of the corpus callosum. ECS volume decreases from 36%
(P9-10) to 25% (P20-21) of total tissue volume. ECS tortuosity lambda =
(D/ADC)0.5, where D is the free diffusion coefficient and ADC is the apparent
diffusion coefficient of TMA+ in the brain, increases as measured perpendicular
to the axons from 1.53 +/- 0.02 (n = 6, mean +/- SEM) to 1.70 +/- 0.02 (n = 6).
TMA+ non-specific uptake (k') was significantly larger at P20 (5.2 +/- 0.6 x
10(-3) s(-1), n = 6) than at P10 (3.5 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) s(-1), n = 6). It can be
concluded that membrane potential changes in mature oligodendrocytes are
accompanied by rapid changes in the K+ gradient resulting from K+ fluxes across
the glial membrane. As a result of the reduced extracellular volume and
increased tortuosity, the membrane fluxes produce larger changes in [K+]e in
the more mature myelinated corpus callosum than before myelination. These
conclusions also account for differences between membrane currents in cells in
slices compared to those in tissue culture where the ECS is essentially
infinite. The size and geometry of the ECS influence the membrane current
patterns of glial cells and may have consequences for the role of glial cells
in spatial buffering.<p>

AB: The recognition molecule myelin-associated glycoprotein is expressed by
oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. The
myelin-associated glycoprotein gene gives rise to two alternatively spliced
transcript variants ("early" and "late" message) which are developmentally
regulated. In this study, using mice, we investigated whether both transcripts
can be expressed in an individual oligodendrocyte or whether different
oligodendrocyte populations exist expressing either one or the other
myelin-associated glycoprotein messenger RNA. For this purpose the cytoplasmic
RNA content of single oligodendrocytes derived either from cultures of
embryonic mouse brain or from the corpus callosum murine slice preparation was
harvested during patch-clamping in the whole-cell recording mode by applying
negative pressure to the patch pipette. After reverse transcription, cDNA
fragments were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and analysed by
agarose gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme maps. Expression of
myelin-associated glycoprotein transcripts could first be detected in those
oligodendrocytes which already had acquired a more mature developmental stage.
This stage could electrophysiologically be characterized by the dominance of
passive K+ currents. In addition to oligodendrocytes expressing only the late
or the early transcript, many cells were found expressing simultaneously both
transcripts with varying levels. The myelin-associated glycoprotein transcript
expression is therefore found to be developmentally regulated at a stage when
oligodendrocytes have already acquired the channel properties of the adult.<p>

AB: Visual attention in dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been
investigated as extensively as memory or language. The aim of this research was
to study the orienting of attention in patients with AD (which temporo-parietal
areas are primarily affected) compared with patients with Parkinson-Dementia,
Parkinson's disease, and normal controls, using the Posner paradigm. Subjects
were instructed to respond by pressing a response key after the appearance of a
target at the same location (valid trial) or at the opposite location (invalid
trial) indicated by a central cue (arrow). According to the experimental
procedure developed by Posner, it has been hypothesized that parietal lobes are
involved in "disengagement operation" (when attention has to move from one
location to another in the controlateral field). Results showed no differences
between AD and the other groups and between left and right hemifield. In
conclusion, the authors did not find any sign of difficulty with disengagement,
and results are discussed in terms of Kinsbourne's interpretation of a balance
between hemispheres.<p>

AB: Investigations of dream mentation in brain damaged patients have shed some
light on the controversial issue of cerebral lateralization of dreaming. To
examine further the relationships between brain function and dreaming, we
studied REM sleep dream recall and content in four patients having undergone
right functional or anatomical hemispherectomy and eight matched control
subjects. Patients were found to have the capacity to report dreams to much the
same extent as control subjects. Further, the patients' dream content was
overall similar to that of the control subjects. The results provide strong
evidence that dreaming is not a right-hemisphere function, and that the left
hemisphere may be more critical for the generation of dreams. In addition, some
characteristics of hemispherectomized patients' dream content (characters,
smells) are consistent with the possibility that a history of epilepsy may
influence REM sleep imagery over the long term.<p>

AB: The interrelationship between bilateral visual field processing,
hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric transmission time (IHTT) was
examined in two experiments in order to test two theories regarding callosal
function and lateralized visual processing. Contrary to both theoretical
speculations [Braun, Neuropsychology Review, Vol. 3, pp. 321-365, 1992] and a
recent report [Nowicka et al., Neuropsychologia, Vol. 34, pp. 147-151, 1996],
the directional asymmetry in evoked potential measures of IHTT did not vary
with task differences in indices of hemispheric specialization. IHTT was faster
from right to left hemispheres regardless of visual field advantage for the
task. Similarly, patterns of correlation between IHTT and bilateral field
advantage did not change between verbal and spatial matching tasks, despite
differences in visual field advantage. Since the latter data did not
consistently support the Brown and Jeeves [Neuropsychologia, Vol. 31. pp.
1267-1281, 1993] hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis involving hemispheric
asymmetries in attention rather than processing specialization was proposed.<p>

with clinical and radiological findings indicative of the Schinzel acrocallosal
syndrome. He was born to non-consangiuneous parents. His father had been
diagnosed with Greig syndrome. The patient underwent surgery for preaxial
polysyndactyly of both hands and feet. The similarity to the Greig syndrome is
discussed. It is possible that both the acrocallosal syndrome and the Greig
syndrome are variant expressions of the same autosomal dominant condition.

AB: Ionizing radiation is commonly used in the treatment of brain tumors but
can cause significant damage to surrounding normal brain. The pathogenesis of
this damage is uncertain, and understanding the response of potential target
cell populations may provide information useful for developing strategies to
optimize therapeutic irradiation. In the mammalian forebrain, the subependyma
is a mitotically active area that is a source of oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes, and it has been hypothesized that depletion of cells from this
region could play a role in radiation-induced white matter injury. Using a
distinct morphological pattern of nuclear fragmentation and an
immunohistochemical method to specifically label the 3'-hydroxyl termini of DNA
strand breaks (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick
end labeling), we quantified apoptosis in the subependyma in the young adult
rat brain after single and fractionated doses of X-rays. Significant increases
in apoptotic index (percentage of cells showing apoptosis) were detected 3 h
after irradiation, and the peak apoptotic index was detected at 6 h. Six h
after irradiation, the dose response for apoptosis was characterized by a steep
increase in apoptotic index between 0.5 and 2.0 Gy and a plateau from 2-30 Gy.
The fraction of cells susceptible to apoptosis was estimated to be about 40%,
and treatment of rats with cycloheximide inhibited apoptosis. When daily 1.5-Gy
fractions of X-rays were administered, the first three fractions were equally
effective at decreasing the cell population via apoptosis. There was no
additional apoptosis or decrease in cellularity in spite of one to four
additional doses of X-rays. Those data suggested some input of cells into the
subependymal population during fractionated treatment, and subsequent studies
showed that there was a significant rise in 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine labeling
index 2-3 days after irradiation, indicating increased cellular proliferation.
The proliferative response after depletion of cells via apoptosis may represent
the recruitment of a relatively quiescent stem cell population. It is possible
that the radiation response of subependymal stem cells and not the
apoptotic-sensitive population per se are critical elements in the response of
the brain to radiation injury.<p>

AB: Pyramidal cells, the major class of cortical excitatory neurons, can be
divided into different subpopulations based upon the target region of their
principal axon projection. The activity of pyramidal neurons is regulated in
part through inhibitory synaptic inputs to the soma from local circuit neurons.
However, little is known about how the density of these axosomatic inputs
differs among subpopulations of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of
primates. In this study, retrograde transport of wheat germ
agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was used to identify pyramidal
neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46), which were labeled via
either associational (ipsilateral hemisphere) or callosal (contralateral
hemisphere) principal axon projections. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that
the relative number of terminals apposed to the somatic membrane did not differ
between associational and callosal neurons. However, neurons in the
supragranular layers were apposed by a significantly greater number of axon
terminals than were neurons in the infragranular layers. These findings suggest
that the laminar environment of a neuron may play a more important role than
principal axon projection in determining the amount of axosomatic inhibitory
input it receives.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: The ability to visualize median-sagittal brain structures by
magnetic resonance imaging improves planning for surgery to treat lesions of
the third ventricle. The most appropriate path to the third ventricle is the
transcallosal approach. The present study was undertaken to describe the
surgical anatomy and landmarks encountered during this approach. METHODS: The
transcallosal-interforniceal approach was undertaken in 30 formalin-fixed
brains using an operating microscope. The surface landmarks for the approach
pathway were the two points, P5 and P7, located 5 and 7 cm anterior to the
central sulcus, respectively. Using these two points on the cortical surface as
references, a variety of measurements were made to provide quantitative
information about distances between brain structures that are encountered
during the surgical approach. Measurements that were made include the
following: 1) the distance between P5 and the cingulate sulcus, 2) the distance
between the cingulate sulcus and the corpus callosum, 3) the height of the
corpus callosum, 4) the distance between the anterior commissure and the
foramen of Monro, and 5) the distance between the lower margin of the corpus
callosum and the fornix. RESULTS: Mean values for these key measurements were
as follows: 1) 23.96 mm (range, 15.0-32.0 mm); 2) 13.50 mm (range, 8.0-20.0 mm)
with reference to P5 and 12.73 mm (range, 16.0-18.0 mm) with reference to P7;
3) 6.12 mm (range, 4.0-8.0 mm) with reference to P5 and 6.60 mm (range, 4.0-9.0
mm) with reference to P7; 4) 4.96 mm (range, 2.5-10.0 mm), independent of P5
and P7; and 5) 8.46 mm (range, 3.0-16.0 mm) with reference to P5 and 11.04 mm
(range, 6.0-22.0 mm) with reference to P7. CONCLUSION: The detailed
quantitative information obtained in this study about the interforniceal
approach permitted definition of surgical approach pathways that preserve
important anatomic structures, such as the motor strip, genu of the corpus
callosum, fornical commissure (hippocampal commissure), anterior commissure,
and fornical columns. The approach through this surgical corridor can easily be
planned and performed in individual cases using median-sagittal magnetic
resonance imaging scans.<p>

AB: A tumour which on CT is clearly intrinsic, irregular, exhibits patchy
enhancement with contrast, and invades periventricular tissues, especially the
corpus callosum, is very likely to be a glioma and may not be biopsied. A case
is presented with these radiological features in which the tumour proved to be
a tuberculoma, with complete clinical and radiological resolution after
antituberculous chemotherapy.<p>

AB: We investigated the nature of cGMP-synthesizing cells in the developing rat
forebrain using cGMP-immunocytochemistry in combination with in vitro
incubation of brain slices. When brain slices of immature rats, aged between 1
and 4 weeks, were incubated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide
(NO) donor compound, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), small round cells with a few processes in and
around the corpus callosum were visualized with the cGMP-antibody. The
morphology and the distribution of the cGMP-positive cells were consistent with
the criteria for oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the cGMP-positive cells
expressed 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and gelsolin,
which are marker proteins for oligodendrocytes. Therefore, we concluded that
the cGMP-positive cells were oligodendrocytes. A subpopulation of the
oligodendrocyte was found to be cGMP-immunoreactive also when slices were
incubated in the absence of SNP. Furthermore, incubation of the slice in the
presence of L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase, but in the absence of SNP
abolished cGMP immunostaining. In addition, some populations of neurons and
astrocytes in restricted brain areas produced cGMP in response to the
incubation with SNP as previously reported, whereas both ameboid and ramified
microglial cells did not respond to the treatment. Atrial natriuretic peptide,
a stimulator of particulate guanylyl cyclase, enhanced cGMP synthesis in
astrocytes in some brain regions but not in oligodendrocytes. These findings
indicate that oligodendrocytes in the immature rat brain express soluble
guanylyl cyclase. No cGMP-positive oligodendrocytes were found in the mature
rat brain, suggesting that cGMP may mediate signals related to myelinogenesis
in the rat brain.<p>

AB: This microsurgical study attempts to analyze the intraoperative anatomic
vascular variations associated with the anterior communicating artery (ACoA)
aneurysms in 120 patients who were operated on at the Neurosurgical Department
of Ataturk University Medical School, Erzurum, Turkiye. All patients underwent
radical surgery for aneurysm by the right pterional approach. The findings were
recorded during surgical intervention and through the slides and videotapes of
the operations. A total of 72 (60%) of our patients had vascular variations in
the vicinity of the ACoA. Marked hypoplasia of the A1 segment of anterior
cerebral artery (ACA) at the right or left side (26.6%, n = 32), median artery
of the corpus callosum (MACC) (14%, n = 17), duplication of the ACoA (8.3%, n =
10), duplication of the A1 segment of ACA (7.5%, n = 9) and azygous
pericallosal artery (3.3%, n = 4) were the variations that were observed during
operations. A retrospective study of the cerebral angiograms of the cases
indicated that preoperative diagnosis of the A1 or ACoA duplication was not
possible, 14 (82.4%) of the 17 MACC's were easily identified, while three
(17.6%) could not be diagnosed. From this intraoperative study, we concluded
that, regardless of whether a vascular variation has been identified
preoperatively, ACoA aneurysm surgery should be undertaken with the possibility
of an MACC in mind. The recognition of the anatomic variations of the ACoA and
the detailed knowledge of the microvascular relationships of the aneurysms will
allow the neurosurgeons to construct a better and safer microdissection plan to
save time on the one hand and to prevent postoperative neurological deficits on
the other.<p>

AB: In a recent study with the Poffenberger paradigm, Brizzolara et al.
reported longer estimates of interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) for children
aged 7 years than for adults. They interpreted this finding as evidence for
incomplete functional maturity of the corpus callosum in young children. The
present study was we were unable to replicate the age effect reported by
Brizzolara et al. A closer look at the original study revealed that only 80
observations per child had been collected, which makes it probable that the
larger IHTTs in 7-year-olds were caused by stimulus-response compatibility
rather than by the lower efficiency of the corpus callosum during childhood
years.<p>

AB: The so-called Xp21 contiguous deletion syndrome or complex glycerol kinase
deficiency (GKD) usually presents with classical Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD) or a milder dystrophic myopathy, adrenal hypoplasia, and GKD. A number of
syndromic and nonsyndromic cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) also
map to that location. To date, none of the cases of complex GKD have been
associated with ACC. Here, we report on a patient with a complex phenotype as a
result of the Xp21 contiguous deletion syndrome in association with ACC.
Biochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses were performed to detect and
establish the size of the genomic deletion. It is at least 3 million base pairs
in length; however, exact limits could not be determined in the present study.
Nevertheless, we suggest the presence of a primary gene involved in the
embryogenesis of the corpus callosum between Xp21.1 and Xp22.11.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To evaluate corpus callosum involvement as a prognostic factor for
patients with high-grade astrocytoma. METHODS: From 1986 through 1994, 141
adult patients with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt; or = 40 underwent
primary treatment for anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) at the University of Washington Medical Center. Preoperative magnetic
resonance imaging and/or computed tomography to assess corpus callosum
involvement was available for 105 of these patients. Corpus callosum
involvement was evaluated as a prognostic factor for survival using recursive
partitioning analysis and multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazards
model. RESULTS: For the 105 patients evaluable for corpus callosum involvement,
the median and 2-year survival were 59 weeks and 28%, respectively. On
multivariate analysis, the only independent prognostic factors were KPS (p =
0.0001) and histology (p = 0.042). On recursive partitioning analysis, the
first significant split occurred at KPS &lt; 70 vs. KPS &gt; or = 70. Patients
with KPS &gt; or = 70 were split by age (&lt; 50 years vs. &gt; or = 50 years),
with those younger than 50 years further split by absence or presence of corpus
callosum involvement. Among patients with KPS &gt; or = 70 and age &lt; 50
years, median survival was 57 weeks if the corpus callosum was involved (35%
2-year survival) and 105 weeks if the corpus callosum was not involved (56%
2-year survival). CONCLUSION: Corpus callosum involvement based on preoperative
imaging is an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival among the subgroup of
young, good-performance-status patients with high-grade astrocytoma.<p>

AB: The present study investigated the effects of intraperitoneal injections of
thymosin alpha1 on the supraventricular amoeboid microglial cells (SAMC) in the
newborn athymic and normal BALB/c mice. The microglial cells labelled by the
lectin GSA I-B4 and the antibody Mac-1 showed a 27% reduction in number in the
athymic mice receiving thymosin alpha1 injections compared with those receiving
vehicle injections, and a 37% reduction in BALB/c mice receiving thymosin
alpha1 injections compared with those receiving vehicle injections. Some of the
SAMC in both BALB/c and athymic mice receiving thymosin alpha1 injections
became ramified, while the remainder still exhibited their normal amoeboid
appearance with few filopodial processes. Ultrastructurally, the lectin
reaction product was confined to the plasma membrane and some cytoplasmic
vacuoles of labelled SAMC. In both BALB/c and athymic mice, some labelled
microglial cells became slender or elongated after thymosin alpha1 injections.
Also their cytoplasm was reduced and contained fewer organelles.
Radioimmunoassay of the plasma of thymosin alpha1 and vehicle-injected mice
showed that there was a significant increase in the cortisol level in BALB/c (P
&lt; 0.01) and athymic (P &lt; 0.001) mice 5 days after thymosin alpha1
injections, compared with that of the control mice. The results point to a
strong correlation between the reduction of SAMC and the increased level of
plasma cortisol. Supporting this is the fact that cortisol is known to suppress
the production of monocytes considered to be the precursors of amoeboid
microglia.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To review the intracranial and facial imaging features in children
with congenital anophthalmos. METHODS: We retrospectively studied eight
children with anophthalmos with respect to intraorbital, intracranial, and
craniofacial anomalies (six had CT examinations, including the face, orbits,
and brain, and four had MR imaging, including the orbits and brain). RESULTS:
Three patients had primary bilateral anophthalmos on CT (n = 1) and MR (n = 3)
studies. In these patients, MR images showed hypoplasia of the optic chiasm and
posterior visual pathways (n = 3), agenesis (n = 1) or dysgenesis of the corpus
callosum (n = 2), and a mass in the tuber cinereum region (n = 1). One patient
had incontinentia pigmenti. Five patients had unilateral anophthalmos on CT (n
= 5) and MR (n = 1) studies. One of these patients had a contralateral
congenital cystic eye and one had contralateral severe microphthalmia and
absent optic chiasm. All had craniofacial anomalies that consisted of midline
facial clefts (n = 2) and concomitant hemifacial hypoplasia (n = 2). One had a
craniosynostosis. All five had normal-appearing brains. CONCLUSION: Patients
with bilateral anophthalmos represent a distinct group from those with
unilateral anophthalmos. In our patients, bilateral anophthalmos was associated
with absence of the optic chiasm, diminished size of the posterior optic
pathways, and agenesis or dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Patients with
unilateral anophthalmos had severe craniofacial anomalies. Imaging of the face
is helpful in patients with unilateral anophthalmos.<p>

AB: We studied the relationship between corpus callosum area and both
inter-hemispheric facilitation and interference in schizophrenics and controls.
Mid-sagittal sections through the corpus callosum were measured using
structural magnetic resonance imaging on 42 patients and 43 normal controls,
along with symptom profiles. In a sub-sample, a modified version of the Stroop
Test was also performed (27 patients and 29 controls) to assess
inter-hemispheric facilitation and interference of colour naming. In the larger
sample (total subjects, n = 85), there were no significant differences between
patients and controls in CC area but a trend towards smaller values in patients
in all but the posterior segment. In the sub-sample, bilateral facilitation was
greater, and interference, less in schizophrenics compared with controls. There
was a positive correlation between facilitation and posterior CC area,
parallelled by a negative correlation between interference and posterior CC
area, in both patients and controls, which only reached statistical
significance when both groups were combined. These findings suggest that the
link, between CC size and neuropsychological processes involving
inter-hemispheric transfer of information, is common to both schizophrenics and
normal controls. There were significant negative correlations between anterior
CC area and psychomotor poverty (avolition, anhedonia and affective
flattening), and a suggestion that the negative correlation between age and CC
size in controls was not present in patients.<p>

to consanguineous parents. Abnormal findings included agenesis of the corpus
callosum, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), postaxial polydactyly of fingers,
cleft soft palate, intestinal malrotation, large anterior fontanelle, prominent
forehead, hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, short nose and mandible and
preauricular skin tags, mixed hearing loss, laryngomalacia, and growth and
severe motor and mental retardation. A review of previous reports on the
acrocallosal syndrome shows considerable clinical variability; minimal
diagnostic criteria are proposed. A developmental field defect with disturbance
of midline development is suggested.<p>

AB: We describe the clinical and radiologic changes related to progressive
facial hemiatrophy (Parry-Romberg syndrome) occurring during a 20-month period
in a child who presented with unilateral neurologic deficits and facial
hemiatrophy. CT and MR findings included unilateral focal infarctions in the
corpus callosum, diffuse deep and subcortical white matter signal changes, mild
cortical thickening, and leptomeningeal enhancement with dense mineral
deposition. Angiographic findings were normal. We hypothesize that a
noninfectious, unilateral inflammatory process, possibly associated with a
chronic vasomotor disturbance and sympathetic nerve chain inflammation, was a
major factor in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To investigate the MR findings of childhood metachromatic
leukodystrophy (MLD). METHODS: Nine MR imaging studies in seven children (five
girls and two boys, 10 to 32 months old) with MLD were evaluated
retrospectively for the extent and progression of white matter abnormalities
and the presence of contrast enhancement. RESULTS: All seven cases showed
symmetric, confluent high signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the
periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale. A posterior predominance of
white matter abnormalities was noted in all cases. Although initially spared
from demyelination in all cases, in one case, the subcortical U fibers were
later involved in demyelination of follow-up MR studies. Other sites of
involvement were the genu (n = 5) and splenium (n = 6) of the corpus callosum,
the posterior limbs of the internal capsule (n = 5), the descending pyramidal
tracts (n = 4), the claustrum (n = 4), and the cerebral white matter (n = 2);
diffuse brain atrophy was seen in two cases. No enhancement of the lesion was
seen on any of the five postcontrast examinations. A "tigroid" pattern,
previously described in cases of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, was noted in the
centrum semiovale in six cases. CONCLUSION: In late-infantile MLD,
demyelination is more prominent in the occipital region. In addition to
demyelination of the periventricular white matter, common manifestations
include a "tigroid" pattern and involvement of the corpus callosum, the
internal capsule, and the corticospinal tract.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To study the anatomy and embryology of the lamina rostralis, and
to determine whether the rostrum is, as frequently stated, the last section of
the corpus callosum to develop. METHODS: The rostrum was analyzed in dissected
adult brains and on MR studies in 300 patients with a normal corpus callosum
and in 84 patients with a hypogenetic corpus callosum. MR images of intact
fetuses and photographs of dissected fetal and adult vertebrate brains were
also analyzed. RESULTS: The rostrum extends from the genu to the upper end of
the lamina terminalis and consists of two sections: a thick beaked segment and
the thin lamina rostralis, which blends posteriorly with the lamina terminalis.
During fetal development the lamina rostralis changes from a semivertical to a
semihorizontal orientation. Many hypogenetic corpora callosi have a
semivertical lamina rostralis. A rudimentary beaked segment can be present
without a normal genu. CONCLUSIONS: The rostrum is not the last segment of the
corpus callosum to develop. Rather, the lamina rostralis segment of the fetal
rostrum is already present before the genu and splenium develop. Additionally,
the beaked segment of the rostrum develops concurrently with maturation of the
genu.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To define the size and appearance of the normal fetal third
ventricle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The third ventricle was prospectively
assessed in 441 consecutive normal second- and third-trimester fetuses. The
fetuses were divided into six gestational age ranges. Data regarding the size
and configuration of the third ventricle were analyzed for each group. RESULTS:
The third ventricle was seen in 435 of 440 (98.9%) fetuses. It appeared as a
single echogenic line between the thalami in 171 (38.9%) fetuses, as parallel
echogenic lines outlining a fluid-filled lumen in 243 (55.2%) fetuses, and as
divergent lines delineating a V-shaped fluid-filled structure in 21 (4.8%)
fetuses. The single-line configuration was most common early in the second
trimester. Later in pregnancy, the ventricle walls could be discerned as
separate parallel or divergent lines outlining a fluid-filled lumen. The
average width of the ventricle was relatively constant at approximately 1 mm
from 12 to 28 weeks. After this time, it enlarged, reaching a maximum 1.9 mm.
CONCLUSION: The third ventricle can be imaged in most second- and
third-trimester fetuses. Its size and configuration evolve through the second
and third trimesters. This evolution must be considered in the evaluation of
normality. At any gestational age, a third ventricle greater than 3.5 mm in
width should be viewed with concern for abnormality.<p>
