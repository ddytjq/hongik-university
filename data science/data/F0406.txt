This section list the example code that is used within this set of web pages. These pages provide a mixture of functions, procedures &amp; simple programs that illustrate the more difficult steps in the course. Although many of these pages are used as examples to other sections of this virtual textbook, the links listed in the lefthand frame are listed in the same order as they are reached in the lecture course. 
<P>
The first subsection provides is a Visual Basic interpretation of the first program used as an example in the first lecture. This provides an illustration of the basic concepts of event programming that is central to how Visual Basic works.
<P>
The next sections provide algorithms and example code for the major steps in first plotting spatial data, then creating thematic maps by link in associated attribute data.
<P>
Lastly, for the adventurous there is a description of how to use GeoSoft's Map Control which provides many of the answers to the difficulties of creating and manipulating maps within MS Windows....a useful tool for dissertations.
<P>
Also, for the more analytically minded, there are some initial pointers to solving some of the basic problems assicated with modelling spatial data within a computer.
