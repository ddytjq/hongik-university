            contributed more than any other scientist to the modern vision of 
            physical reality. His theory of relativity is held as human thought 
            of t<img src="aein01.jpg" width="125" height="145" align="right" alt="Albert Einstein">he 
            highest quality. Around 1886 Einstein began his school career in Munich. 
            As well as his violin lessons, which he had from age six to age thirteen, 
            he also had religious education at home where he was taught Judaism. 
            Two years later he entered the Luitpold Gymnasium and after this his 
            religious education was given at school. He studied mathematics, in 
            particular the calculus, beginning around 1891. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              1894 Einstein's family moved to Milan but Einstein remained in Munich. 
              In 1895 Einstein failed an examination that would have allowed him 
              to study for a diploma as an electrical engineer at the Eidgen&ouml;ssische 
              Technische Hochschule in Zurich. Einstein renounced German citizenship 
              in 1896 and was to be stateless for a number of years. He did not 
              even apply for Swiss citizenship until 1899, citizenship being granted 
              in 1901. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following 
              the failing of the entrance exam to the ETH, Einstein attended secondary 
              school at Aarau planning to use this route to enter the ETH in Zurich. 
              While at Aarau he wrote an essay (for which was only given a little 
              above half marks!) in which he wrote of his plans for the future, 
              see [13]:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>If 
              I were to have the good fortune to pass my examinations, I would 
              go to Zurich. I would stay there for four years in order to study 
              mathematics and physics. I imagine myself becoming a teacher in 
              those branches of the natural sciences, choosing the theoretical 
              part of them. Here are the reasons which lead me to this plan. Above 
              all, it is my disposition for abstract and mathematical thought, 
              and my lack of imagination and practical ability.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed 
            Einstein succeeded with his plan graduating in 1900 as a teacher of 
            mathematics and physics. One of his friends at ETH was Marcel Grossmann 
            who was in the same class as Einstein. Einstein tried to obtain a 
            post, writing to Hurwitz who held out some hope of a position but 
            nothing came of it. Three of Einstein's fellow students, including 
            Grossmann, were appointed assistants at ETH in Zurich but clearly 
            Einstein had not impressed enough and still in 1901 he was writing 
            round universities in the hope of obtaining a job, but without success. 
            </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He did manage 
            to avoid Swiss military service on the grounds that he had flat feet 
            and varicose veins. By mid 1901 he had a temporary job as a teacher, 
            teaching mathematics at the Technical High School in Winterthur. Around 
            this time he wrote:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I 
              have given up the ambition to get to a university ...</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 
            temporary position teaching in a private school in Schaffhausen followed. 
            Then Grossmann's father tried to help Einstein get a job by recommending 
            him to the director of the patent office in Bern. Einstein was appointed 
            as a technical expert third class. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein 
              worked in this patent office from 1902 to 1909, holding a temporary 
              post when he was first appointed, but by 1904 the position was made 
              permanent and in 1906 he was promoted to technical expert second 
              class. While in the Bern patent office he completed an astonishing 
              range of theoretical physics publications, written in his spare 
              time without the benefit of close contact with scientific literature 
              or colleagues. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein 
              earned a doctorate from the University of Zurich in 1905 for a thesis 
              <i>On a new determination of molecular dimensions.</i> He dedicated 
              the thesis to Grossmann. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              the first of<img src="aein02.jpg" width="125" height="157" align="left" alt="Albert Einstein"> 
              three papers, all written in 1905, Einstein examined the phenomenon 
              discovered by Max Planck, according to which electromagnetic energy 
              seemed to be emitted from radiating objects in discrete quantities. 
              The energy of these quanta was directly proportional to the frequency 
              of the radiation. This seemed to contradict classical electromagnetic 
              theory, based on Maxwell's equations and the laws of thermodynamics 
              which assumed that electromagnetic energy consisted of waves which 
              could contain any small amount of energy. Einstein used Planck's 
              quantum hypothesis to describe the electromagnetic radiation of 
              light. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein's 
              second 1905 paper proposed what is today called the special theory 
              of relativity. He based his new theory on a reinterpretation of 
              the classical principle of relativity, namely that the laws of physics 
              had to have the same form in any frame of reference. As a second 
              fundamental hypothesis, Einstein assumed that the speed of light 
              remained constant in all frames of reference, as required by Maxwell's 
              theory. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later 
              in 1905 Einstein showed how mass and energy were equivalent. Einstein 
              was not the first to propose all the components of special theory 
              of relativity. His contribution is unifying important parts of classical 
              mechanics and Maxwell's electrodynamics. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              third of Einstein's papers of 1905 concerned statistical mechanics, 
              a field of that had been studied by Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah 
              Gibbs. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
              1905 Einstein continued working in the areas described above. He 
              made important contributions to quantum theory, but he sought to 
              extend the special theory of relativity to phenomena involving acceleration. 
              The key appeared in 1907 with the principle of equivalence, in which 
              gravitational acceleration was held to be indistinguishable from 
              acceleration caused by mechanical forces. Gravitational mass was 
              therefore identical with inertial mass. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              1908 Einstein became a lecturer at the University of Bern after 
              submitting his Habilitation thesis <i>Consequences for the constitution 
              of radiation following from the energy distribution law of black 
              bodies.</i> The following year he become professor of physics at 
              the University of Zurich, having resigned his lectureship at Bern 
              and his job in the patent office in Bern. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 
              1909 Einstein was recognised as a leading scientific thinker and 
              in that year he resigned from the patent office. He was appointed 
              a full professor at the Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1911. 
              In fact 1911 was a very significant year for Einstein since he was 
              able to make preliminary predictions about how a ray of light from 
              a distant star, passing near the Sun, would appear to be bent slightly, 
              in the direction of the Sun. This would be highly significant as 
              it would lead to the first experimental evidence in favour of Einstein's 
              theory. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 
              1912, Einstein began a new phase of his gravitational research, 
              with the help of his mathematician friend Marcel Grossmann, by expressing 
              his work in terms of the tensor calculus of Tullio Levi-Civita and 
              Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro. Einstein called his new work the general 
              theory of relativity. He moved from Prague to Zurich in 1912 to 
              take up a chair at the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule 
              in Zurich. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein 
              returned to Germany in 1914 but did not reapply for German citizenship. 
              What he accepted was an impressive offer. It was a research position 
              in the Prussian Academy of Sciences together with a chair (but no 
              teaching duties) at the University of Berlin. He was also offered 
              the directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics in Berlin 
              which was about to be established. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              a number of false starts Einstein published, late in 1915, the definitive 
              version of general theory. Just before publishing this work he lectured 
              on general relativity at G&ouml;ttingen and he wrote:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>To 
              my great joy, I completely succeeded in convincing </i>Hilbert<i> 
              and </i>Klein<i>.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
            fact Hilbert submitted for publication, a week before Einstein completed 
            his work, a paper which contains the correct field equations of general 
            relativity. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
            British eclipse expeditions in 1919 confirmed his predictions, Einstein 
            was idolised by the popular press. The London <i>Times</i> ran the 
            headline on 7 November 1919:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Revolution 
              in science - New theory of the Universe - Newtonian ideas overthrown.</i> 
              </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
            1920 Einstein's lectures in Berlin were disrupted by demonstrations 
            which, although officially denied, were almost certainly anti-Jewish. 
            Certainly there were strong feelings expressed against his works during 
            this period which Einstein replied to in the press quoting Lorentz, 
            Planck and Eddington as supporting his theories and stating that certain 
            Germans would have attacked them if he had been:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>... 
              a German national with or without swastika instead of a Jew with 
              liberal international convictions...</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 
            1921 Einstein made his first visit to the United States. His main 
            reason was to raise funds for the planned Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
            However he received the Barnard Medal during his visit and lectured 
            several times on relativity. He is reported to have commented to the 
            chairman at the lecture he gave in a large hall at Princeton which 
            was overflowing with people:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I 
              never realised that so many Americans were interested in tensor 
              analysis.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein 
            received the Nobel Prize in 1921 but not for relativity rather for 
            his 1905 work on the photoelectric effect. In fact he was not present 
            in December 1922 to receive the prize being on a voyage to Japan. 
            Around this time he made many international visits. He had visited 
            Paris earlier in 1922 and during 1923 he visited Palestine. After 
            making his last major scientific discovery on the association of waves 
            with matter in 1924 he made further visits in 1925, this time to South 
            America. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among 
            further honours which Einstein received were the Copley Medal of the 
            Royal Society in 1925 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical 
            Society in 1926. </font> 
            <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niels 
              Bohr and Einstein were to carry on a debate on quantum theory which 
              began at the Solvay Conference in 1927. Planck, Niels Bohr, de Broglie, 
              Heisenberg, Schr&ouml;dinger and Dirac were at this conference, 
              in addition to Einstein. Einstein had declined to give a paper at 
              the conference and:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>... 
              said hardly anything beyond presenting a very simple objection to 
              the probability interpretation .... Then he fell back into silence 
              ...</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed 
            Einstein's life had been hectic and he was to pay the price in 1928 
            with a physical collapse brought on through overwork. However he made 
            a full recovery despite having to take things easy throughout 1928. 
            </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 1930 
            he was making international visits again, back to the United States. 
            A third visit to the United States in 1932 was followed by the offer 
            of a post at Princeton. The idea was that Einstein would spend seven 
            months a year in Berlin, five months at Princeton. Einstein accepted 
            and left Germany in December 1932 for the United States. The following 
            month the Nazis came to power in Germany and Einstein was never to 
            return there. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 
              1933 Einstein travelled in Europe visiting Oxford, Glasgow, Brussels 
              and Zurich. Offers of academic posts which he had found it so hard 
              to get in 1901, were plentiful. He received offers from Jerusalem, 
              Leiden, Oxford, Madrid and Paris. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
              was intended only as a visit became a permanent arrangement by 1935 
              when he applied and was granted permanent residency in the United 
              States. At Princeton his work attempted to unify the laws of physics. 
              However he was attempting problems of great depth and he wrote:- 
              </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I 
              have locked myself into quite hopeless scientific problems - the 
              more so since, as an elderly man, I have remained estranged from 
              the society here...</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
            1940 Einstein became a citizen of the United States, but chose to 
            retain his Swiss citizenship. He made many contributions to peace 
            during his life. In 1944 he made a contribution to the war effort 
            by hand writing his 1905 paper on special relativity and putting it 
            up for auction. It raised six million dollars, the manuscript today 
            being in the Library of Congress. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 
              1949 Einstein was unwell. A spell in hospital helped him recover 
              but he began to prepare for death by drawing up his will in 1950. 
              He left his scientific papers to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, 
              a university which he had raised funds for on his first visit to 
              the USA, served as a governor of the university from 1925 to 1928 
              but he had turned down the offer of a post in 1933 as he was very 
              critical of its administration. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
              more major event was to take place in his life. After the death 
              of the first president of Israel in 1952, the Israeli government 
              decided to offer the post of second president to Einstein. He refused 
              but found the offer an embarrassment since it was hard for him to 
              refuse without causing offence. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
              week before his death Einstein signed his last letter. It was a 
              letter to Bertrand Russell in which he agreed that his name should 
              go on a manifesto urging all nations to give up nuclear weapons. 
              It is fitting that one of his last acts was to argue, as he had 
              done all his life, for international peace.</font>
