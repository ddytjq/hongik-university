standard functions of the DOM and the Microsoft extensions that will allow
you to process XML documents efficiently and effectively. Handling multiple
XML documents and processing XML output from databases (like Microsoft SQL

Implementing SOAP at this level provides a great understanding of the protocol, however it is very "code intensive", hence Craig will then discuss the use of a SOAP toolkit.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Microsoft SOAP Toolkit 2 will be demonstrated - this will be an important aspect in future developments because the client-side SOAP Toolkit objects are being shipped with Windows XP.  And because the Toolkit uses the Web Service Description Language (WSDL), an overview will be provided.
				<br>
				<br>
				A brief overview of discovery services will be provided - Universal, Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) will be touched on.  Discovery repositories such as xmethods.com and salcentral will be demonstrated.

				Examples will be provided - Craig will be using Visual Basic, Internet Explorer and possibly VB.Net.

				<br>
				<br>
				In this detailed session we will examine many of these issues, and look at how developers can solve some of the real-world problems and difficulties encountered with these new tools.  Topics will include interaction of client-side and server-side script, implementing robust state management, deploying to web gardens and farms, plus how to make best use of real-world web services.  The session will be focussed firmly on developer needs, and will include extensive live demonstrations and examples.

				Returning to his popular role as VBUG’s “Mr Practical”, Russell rolls up his sleeves and gets his hands dirty by building and deploying a real-life .NET application. TrackBid.com demonstrates .NET features by exposing a Web Service that can be accessed by either a Rich client using VB Windows Forms, or a sophisticated HTML interface, built using WebForms.

It also explains how you can leverage interfaces such as IComparer, IFormatProvider, and IFormatter; derive new collection-like object by inheriting from abstract classes provided by the runtime; and take advantage of the Regex class for working with regular expressions.

				The .NET Framework uses a system called garbage collection to monitor
				allocated resources, such as objects and variables,
				and make them available for reuse when they are no longer needed. Visual
				Basic developers generally are accustomed to automatic memory management and
				the programming practices that you are familiar with will apply to the
				majority of the managed objects that you create in the .NET Framework.
				However, understanding .NET garbage collection will still be important in
				developing resource friendly applications and vital when developing classes.
				This session describes how the garbage collector automatically manages the
				allocation and release of memory for the managed objects in your
				application. In addition, it will demonstrate the recommended design pattern
				to use to properly clean up any unmanaged resources that your application
				creates. The session will also look at ways in which we can effect garbage
				collection and get it to happen when we want.

				One line of code may seem an unlikely basis for a whole session. At first sight, setting a variable to Nothing appears to do much the same thing in .NET as it does in VB6 and COM. In reality however, replacing 'reference counting' with 'garbage collection' as the means by which memory in VB programs is managed is one of the biggest single changes in .NET, with dramatic everyday consequences (some good, some bad) for VB developers. In this session, Rob explains how garbage collection works, and more importantly, what it means to you.

				There are several ways to create Web Services in .NET. The standard approach is to use ASP.NET, but you can also create Web Services using the .NET Remoting framework. In return for a bit more effort, .NET Remoting can give more power and flexibility to your Web Services than the 'standard' approach, and also comes with 'go faster' stripes.

				Whether you are new to Web development, or an old hand at ASP, ASP.NET has some great new features for state management, and many of the old rules concerning Session state have completely changed. In this presentation, Rob will demonstration all the new state management features: View, Cache, Session and Application, and discuss when and where to use each one. For Web newbies, Rob will explain why state management is an important issue in Web Applications, and for Web veterans, he will re-visit such issues as using a database for state, concurrency and multi-threading topics, and scalability

				ASP.NET allows developers to take a brand-new look at the way they design and implement security for web applications.  With inbuilt support for authentication and authorisation providers, plus integration with Windows and Passport security schemes, it can significantly simplify the process for developers and administrators alike.
				This in-depth session examines the security features offered, and shows how they can be implemented in Web Form and Web Service applications.  Starting with a look at the Windows, Forms and Passport authentication providers, the session moves on to look at user and group privileges, before addressing the specific details of how security is managed on a declarative or programmatic basis.  The topic concludes by highlighting some additional concerns for security, including cookies, viewstate and caching.

				XML is a critical tool for creating distributed applications in

				background in XML that you need to use Visual Basic in your applications.
				The session will show you what XML is, what tools are available to work with
				XML, and how to design your applications with XML. You’ll find out how to
				get started with Microsoft’s Document Object Model parser to create and
				process XML documents, and learn about the other tools available for working
				with XML, including XSLT and SAX. Key topics in XML documents are covered,
				including creating tags, attributes, well-formed and valid documents. The
				way that XML is being used in the industry is also covered, including XML
				dialects and XML protocols like SOAP and UDDI. By the end of this workshop
				you’ll be able to create documents and send them between applications (even
				over the Internet).

				This workshop for client-side developers examines how to build commercial quality, re-usable user interfaces in both VB and ASP.NET using VB. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Developers can start thinking of .NET client applications as being more ‘plug and play’ than their Visual Studio 6 counterparts since .NET allows presentation tiers to be built in an object-oriented way.
				<br>
				<br>
				Visual inheritance and dynamic control creation will be examined in both Windows Forms and WebForms. Ways of ‘controlling’ the user by form ‘ownership’, modality and Zorder are to be examined too.
				<br>
				<br>
				Attendees are expected to have a basic appreciation of building .NET applications (eg gained by attending VBUG’s “Introducing VB.NET” course.)
