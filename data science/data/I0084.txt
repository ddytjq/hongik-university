<br />
            GROUP A<br />
<br />
            FRANCE - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            France 0 Senegal 1<br />
<br />
            France 0 Uruguay 0<br />
<br />
            France 0 Denmark 2<br />
<br />
            They arrived as defending champions and departed after the opening phase with their tails between their legs, winless and goalless - the worst record of any titleholder. An ageing squad had nothing left to offer after winning on home soil four years ago and then Euro 2000 and was torn apart mentally following injury to the talismanic Zinedine Zidane. He came back to face Denmark but a 1-0 opening day loss to Senegal and a goalless draw against Uruguay in which Thierry Henry was sent off meant the task had become impossible. The Danes won 2-0 and French pride was shattered.<br />
<br />
            DENMARK - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Denmark 2 Uruguay 1<br />
<br />
            Denmark 1 Senegal 1<br />
<br />
            Denmark 2 France 0<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Denmark 0 England 3<br />
<br />
            Jon Dahl Tomasson was the standard bearer for Denmark in the opening phase with his four goals making a mockery of his flop five years ago at Newcastle. The striker came to the finals as a UEFA Cup winner with Feyenoord which had already earned him a move to AC Milan. A double against Uruguay - a penalty against Senegal and then yet another goal against France showed brilliant predatory instinct.<br />
<br />
            Then nothing, as the Danes were hit by three-goal blast in the opening half by England in the second round. After a promisinig start they left almost without a whimper.<br />
<br />
            SENEGAL - eliminated quarter-finals<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Senegal 1 France 0<br />
<br />
            Senegal 1 Denmark 1<br />
<br />
            Senegal 3 Uruguay 3<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Senegal 2 Sweden 1 (golden goal)<br />
<br />
            Quarter-final:<br />
<br />
            Senegal 0 Turkey 1 (golden goal)<br />
<br />
            After Pape Bouba Diop shocked defending champions France in the opener the problem for Bruno Metsu's men was how to follow that.<br />
<br />
            The answer was to hold the Danes and then survive a Uruguayan fightback from 3-0 down as the eventual draw proved just enough.<br />
<br />
            But against the Swedes in the second round there was even more drama as Henri Camara hit a double, including the extra-time golden goal winner. He dedicated both goals to his mother.<br />
<br />
            In the quarter-finals Senegal's luck ran out, however. They lost out to Turkey whose supersub Ilhan Mansiz lashed in a golden goal winner.<br />
<br />
            But Metsu's side had carried the flag admirably for Africa as they emulated Cameroon's run to the last eight in 1990.<br />
<br />
            URUGUAY - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Uruguay 1 Denmark 2<br />
<br />
            Uruguay 0 France 0<br />
<br />
            Uruguay 3 Senegal 3<br />
<br />
            The Uruguayans provided a brilliant goal from Dario Rodriguez in their first match against the Danes but once they fell to a pair of Jon Dahl Tomasson goals the South Americans appeared to lose their self belief. They couldn't beat ten-man France and although they produced a barnstorming fightback after going three goals down to Senegal - Diego Forlan hitting a beauty - that was not enough for the team which beat Australia in the playoffs to get here. Coach Victor &quot;fat man&quot; Pua stepped down afterwards.<br />
<br />
            GROUP B<br />
<br />
            PARAGUAY - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Paraguay 2 South Africa 2<br />
<br />
            Paraguay 1 Spain 3<br />
<br />
            Paraguay 3 Slovenia 1<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Paraguay 0 Germany 1<br />
<br />
            Paraguay were occasionally brilliant, sometimes dreadful. They were 2-0 up against South Africa, let it slip and drew. That looked to have cost them a place in the second round as they slumped to a far superior Spain, who were determined to ram Paraguayan keeper Jose Luis Chilavert's jibes about Spanish failings back down their throats.<br />
<br />
            But against Slovenia the Paraguayans staged an extraordinary comeback to win 3-1 despite spending much of the match with only ten men after an early dismissal for Carlos Paredes.<br />
<br />
            Paraguay, needing a two-goal win and for Spain to defeat South Africa in the other match, looked out for the count after Milenko Acimovic put Slovenia into a 1-0 half-time lead.<br />
<br />
            But veteran boss Cesare Maldini Paraguay rang the changes, sending on Nelson Cuevas, who bagged two goals, and another from fellow substitute Jorge Campos.<br />
<br />
            The Paraguayans thus made the last 16 by virtue of goals scored after the South Africans lost 3-2 to Spain.<br />
<br />
            But after holding out against Germany for 88 minutes Oliver Neuville's late goal dumped them out and for Chilavert, Maldini and company the World Cup had ended.<br />
<br />
            SLOVENIA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Slovenia 1 Spain 3<br />
<br />
            Slovenia 0 South Africa 1<br />
<br />
            Slovenia 1 Paraguay 3<br />
<br />
            The Slovenes made their World Cup debut - but it was one they preferred to forget by the time it was over prematurely.<br />
<br />
            They lost all their matches and an abject campaign was made all the worse by a bust up between coach Srecko 'lucky' Katanec (who quit afterwards) and star play Zlatko Zahovic, who was sent home after a row between the two.<br />
<br />
            Katenec had also taken the side to Euro 2000 as the newly-independent country of just 1.9million people began to make its mark.<br />
<br />
            With Zahovic they were struggling from the start and without him they sank.<br />
<br />
            SOUTH AFRICA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            South Africa 2 Paraguay 2<br />
<br />
            South Africa 1 Slovenia 0<br />
<br />
            South Africa 2 Spain 3<br />
<br />
            The Bafana Bafana (the Boys) suffered elation and heartbreak within days of each other. They began by coming off second best over 45 minutes to Paraguay but rescued a point with Quinton Fortune's last-gasp penalty. The midfielder chose a dramatic moment to net his first international goal with the injury-time spotkick.<br />
<br />
            Things carreied on for the better with Siyabonga Nomvethe's early winner over Slovenia for South Africa's first win in the finals.<br />
<br />
            But just when it seemed a first ever qualification for the second phase was in the bag Spain ruined it all with their 3-2 win in a match the South Africans needed only to draw and easily could have.<br />
<br />
            South African coach Jomo Sono was still proud of the team's efforts but sloppy defending in the final game and Paraguay's near miraculous comeback against Slovenia meant that they were out by the narrowest of margins - goals scored.<br />
<br />
            SPAIN - eliminated quarter-finals<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Spain 3 Slovenia 1<br />
<br />
            Spain 3 Paraguay 1<br />
<br />
            Spain 3 South Africa 2<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Spain 1 Ireland 1 (after extra-time; Spain won 3-2 on penalties)<br />
<br />
            Quarter-final:<br />
<br />
            Spain 0 South Korea 0 (aet: Spain lost 3-5 on penalties)<br />
<br />
            Yet again Spain failed to live up to expectations - but in many ways it wasn't their fault. Bad luck struck with a vengeance as Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour ruled out two apparently legitimate goals from Ruben Baraja in normal time and Fernando Morientes in extra-time in the quarters against South Korea.<br />
<br />
            The game went to penalties and the Koreans won after skipper Hong Myung-Bo fired home their winner with Spain's Joaquin missing the target.<br />
<br />
            Fernando Morientes and Raul kept the goals coming in the first phase. But in the second round the Spaniards were fortunate to win a penalty shootout to dump out Ireland, keeper Iker Casillas pulling off two fine saves as Gaizka Mendieta tucked away the winner.<br />
<br />
            The luck didn't last long.<br />
<br />
            GROUP C<br />
<br />
            BRAZIL - CHAMPIONS for the fifth time<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Brazil 2 Turkey 1<br />
<br />
            Brazil 4 China 0<br />
<br />
            Brazil 5 Costa Rica 2<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Brazil 2 Belgium 0<br />
<br />
            Quarter-final:<br />
<br />
            Brazil 2 England 1<br />
<br />
            Semi-final:<br />
<br />
            Brazil 1 Turkey 0<br />
<br />
            Final:<br />
<br />
            Brazil 2 Germany 0<br />
<br />
            Having won the Cup a record four times perennial favourites Brazil didn't look anything like their usual selves in qualifying as they lost a staggering six matches. But that didn't matter as coach Luiz Felipe Scolari got the best out of his players once in Asia and they made it five title wins.<br />
<br />
            And with Ronaldo back to his sparkling best - albeit tiring a little quicker - they beat Germany with the 25-year-old twice on target in a 2-0 victory.<br />
<br />
            Yet they started out by labouring to see off Turkey, going a goal down before a late Rivaldo penalty - and two red cards for their opponents - brought a narrow win. China were packed off easily and finally the attack clicked against Costa Rica - though the defence looked feeble. A disallowed 'goal' for Belgium helped in round two as Rivaldo and Ronaldo found the net and then Ronaldinho's tremendous mazy run and pass for Rivaldo and then equally brilliant freekick sank England in the quarters.<br />
<br />
            In the semis Ronaldo's toepoke was sufficient to see off the Turks a second time. In the final it was a case of twice as nice.<br />
<br />
            CHINA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            China's debut appearance turned out to be a huge flop as they failed to score a single point or goal.<br />
<br />
            Little Costa Rica despatched the red giants 2-0 and Brazil virtually walked in four before Turkey bagged another three to leave coach Bora Milutinovic and his men scratching their heads to find any good points.<br />
<br />
            Much-travelled Milutinovic was unable to conjure any magic and stepped down afterwards as agreed beforehand. He explained the secret of his rapport with the country's players was telling his translator to ignore any insults from players.<br />
<br />
            China were the record fifth nation Milutinovic had coached at the World Cup Finals. But he couldn't repeat a run to the quarter finals achied with Mexico in 1986. He had also taken Costa Rica, the United States and Nigeria to the second rounds of the 1990, 1994 and 1998 events.<br />
<br />
            It was small consolation that Asian football chief Peter Velappan is to urge the Chinese to make a bid to stage the 2014 tournament. At least that gives them time to become competitive.<br />
<br />
            COSTA RICA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Costa Rica 2 China 0<br />
<br />
            Costa Rica 1 Turkey 1<br />
<br />
            Costa Rica 2 Brazil 5<br />
<br />
            The Costa Ricans put China in their place but it was all downhill from there- aside from some nice flowing moves against Brazil. But the failure to beat Turkey was to prove decisive for Paulo Wanchope and company.<br />
<br />
            Reynaldo Parks saved a point with a late goal - but three were needed with the Brazil match to finish up.<br />
<br />
            Despite their defensive frailties Brazil were too hot in attack to give the 'Ticos' a whiff of a chance even though they were briefly pegged back from 3-0 to 3-2. The door closed - and opened wide for the Turks.<br />
<br />
            TURKEY - third place<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Turkey 1 Brazil 2<br />
<br />
            Turkey 1 Costa Rica 1<br />
<br />
            Turkey 3 China 0<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Turkey 1 Japan 0<br />
<br />
            Quarter-finals:<br />
<br />
            Turkey 1 Senegal 0 (golden goal)<br />
<br />
            Semi-finals:<br />
<br />
            Turkey 0 Brazil 1<br />
<br />
            3rd-place play-off:<br />
<br />
            Turkey 3 South Korea 2<br />
<br />
            The shock team of the event - if one excludes Germany's run to the final. The opening defeat to Brazil was unlucky in the extreme as the latter benefited from a dubious penalty decision for a far from convincing 2-1 victory after the Turks had two men sent off.<br />
<br />
            Rivaldo's spotkick winner came after Brazil fought back from a goal down to a strike by Turkey's Hasan Sas. Ronaldo equalised but the 86th minute penalty decision was controversial as replays showed the shirt pulling by Alpay Ozalan that brought down Luizao happened outside the box.<br />
<br />
            Korean referee Kim Young-Joo, who was in charge of his first ever World Cup game, gave the kick and sent Alpay and later Hakan Unsal for an early bath.<br />
<br />
            A draw with Costa Rica left the Turks precariously placed but the routine win over China saw a team which was starting to gel.<br />
<br />
            And in rain-soaked Miyagi they duly dumped out co-hosts Japan 1-0, Umit Davala heading the only goal.<br />
<br />
            Suddenly in the last eight in only their second ever World Cup Turkey came face to face with fellow surprise team Senegal and advanced to the last four thanks to a golden goal from supersub Ilhan Mansiz, Davala setting him up.<br />
<br />
            Ronaldo ended the run in the semis as Brazil shaded the sides' second meeting by Hakan Sukur finally got off the mark in a record 11 seconds as the Turks took third place, beating South Korea 3-2 to send a second team of co-hosts packing after the Japanese.<br />
<br />

<br />
            SOUTH KOREA - eliminated in semi-final<br />

            South Korea 0 Spain 0 (South Korea win 5-3 on penalties)<br />
<br />
            Semi-finals:<br />
<br />
            South Korea 0 Germany 1<br />
<br />
            Third-place playoff<br />
<br />
            South Korea 2 Turkey 3<br />
<br />
            The tournament co-hosts' aim was simply to progress from the first round, but they went on an astonishing run to the semi-finals, riding the wave of support from millions of red-clad fans who thronged the streets. The Koreans, guided by Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, ensured Asia's best ever finish at a World Cup. A team that had never even won a World Cup finals match before the tournament put that right with a 2-0 win against Poland before beating Portugal to win the group. Italy were beaten with a golden-goal winner from Ahn Jung-Hwan and Spain were overcome in a penalty shootout after a match condemned by the Spaniards for biased refereeing. A Michael Ballack goal ended their hopes in the semi-final against Germany and they ran out of steam in the third-place playoff with Turkey but their achievements will have reverberations for Asian football for decades to come.<br />

            UNITED STATES - eliminated 1st rd<br />

            Quarter-finals:<br />
<br />
            United States 0 Germany 1<br />
<br />
            The Americans stated their intentions by going three goals up to the Portugal and held on for a famous 3-2. In a tense atmosphere they held South Korea to 1-1 thanks to a Brad Friedel penalty save from Lee Eul-Yong. Bruce Arena's side slumped to Poland but goal difference took them through to the second round where Brian McBride and Landon Donovan hit the target in a famous win over regional rivals Mexico. The story even made the front pages of US newspapers. German defensive stability and a penalty for handball which wasn't given knocked the Americans out in the quarters when they could have pulled off a major upset. The States had their best tournament since 1932.<br />
<br />
            PORTUGAL - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />

            Portugal 2 United States 3<br />

<br />
            Portugal 0 South Korea 1<br />
<br />
            A disastrous tournament for the 2000 European Championships semi-finalists. World Footballer of the Year Luis Figo flopped miserably, apparently struggling with injury while Joao Pinto was sent off and embroiled in an alleged punching incident involving Argentinian referee Angel Sanchez in the heated South Korea match. He faces a lengthy ban. A 4-0 win over Poland including a Pauleta hat-trick promised better things but the Koreans snuffed out any hope in Incheon.<br />
<br />
            POLAND - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Poland 0 South Korea 2<br />
<br />
            Poland 0 Portugal 4<br />
<br />
            Poland 3 United States 1<br />
<br />
            Surprisingly poor performance from a team that had easily qualified for the finals. Top-class goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek was beaten twice in the opener to South Korea and Portugal fired four goals past him in the second match as striker Emmanuel Olisadebe misfired. A 3-1 win against the United States saved some pride but Polish football left Asia in the doldrums.<br />

            Teams review<br />
<br />
            GROUP E<br />
<br />
            CAMEROON - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Cameroon 1 Ireland 1<br />
<br />
            Cameroon 1 Saudi Arabia 0<br />
<br />
            Cameroon 0 Germany 2<br />
<br />
            Cameroon came as Olympic and African champions. They left in the shadow of Senegal and having not done themselves justice. Failure to see off Ireland meant that the Germany match became crucial to their hopes of advancing and the Indomitable Lions had a hugely-motivated coach in their own German Winfried Schafer. But the team were strangely muted that day whereas the Germans, anxious not to have to rely on the Saudis holding Ireland, came up with the goods.<br />
<br />
            Cameroon beat the Saudis - but by less than their two main rivals with only Samuel Eto'o on the mark. And so began a long journey home - shorter than the circuitous route by which they arrived days late, but far sadder.<br />
<br />
            GERMANY - Runners-up<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Germany 8 Saudi Arabia 0<br />
<br />
            Germany 1 Ireland 1<br />
<br />
            Germany 2 Cameroon 0<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Germany 1 Paraguay 0<br />
<br />
            Quarter-finals:<br />
<br />
            Germany 1 United States 0<br />
<br />
            Semi-finals:<br />
<br />
            Germany 1 South Korea 0<br />
<br />
            Final: Germany 0 Brazil 2<br />
<br />
            Germany proved that even in the midst of an injury crisis they will always be there or thereabouts. But Ronaldo's Brazil proved a cut above in the final.<br />
<br />
            The Germans registered the highest win at any finals for 20 years against the outclassed Saudis but then had to beat Cameroon after conceding a late equaliser against the Irish.<br />
<br />
            But in Miroslav Klose they had found their most potent weapon since Gerd Muller and his five goals, including a hat-trick against the Saudis, helped them through the opening phase. After that, he failed to add to his tally.<br />
<br />
            Against Paraguay it was Oliver Neuville who struck at the death after a workmanlike performance, Michael Ballack saw off the United States in the quarters - though the US side deserved far better, and Ballack struck again to end South Korea's amazing run in the semis. Ballack's yellow card in that game saw him suspended for the final - and he was sorely missed.<br />
<br />
            IRELAND - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Ireland 1 Cameroon 1<br />
<br />
            Ireland 1 Germany 1<br />
<br />
            Ireland 3 Saudi Arabia 0<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Ireland 1 Spain 1 (aet; Spain won 3-2 on penalties)<br />
<br />
            The Irish arrived in Japan via Saipan after being hit by a bombshell - the sending home of skipper Roy Keane, who criticised training facilities and what he saw as a lack of knuckling down to the task ahead. The team proved him wrong as Mick McCarthy's side reached the second phase, holding both Cameroon and Germany, the latter thank's to Robbie Keane's late, late strike. They then notched more than one goal in a World Cup match for the first time against the Saudis. But having given Spain more than they got in the next round the ensuing penalty shootout brought only heartache and another hard luck story of the kind that the likes of England know only too well.<br />
<br />
            SAUDI ARABIA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Saudi Arabia 0 Germany 8<br />
<br />
            Saudi Arabia 0 Cameroon 1<br />
<br />
            Saudi Arabia 0 Ireland 3<br />
<br />
            Outclassed by Germany things just about got better - but only just. The Saudis were out of their depth aside from a number of promising but fruitless attacks against Cameroon. Even traditionally shotshy Ireland put three past them.<br />
<br />
            Snubbed as they returned home the team can only look to the future. Prince Abdallah ben Abdel Aziz on Sunday has handed the task to Prince Abdel Majid ben Abdel Aziz.<br />
<br />
            Coach Nasser Al-Johar failed to live up to his name as 'Mr Fixit' and the finals will for the Saudis be best rapidly forgotten.<br />
<br />
            GROUP F<br />
<br />
            ARGENTINA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Argentina 1 Nigeria 0<br />
<br />
            Argentina 0 England 1<br />
<br />
            Argentina 1 Sweden 1<br />
<br />
            Along with France the Argentines were the real flops of the event. They arrived having raced through the Latin American qualifiers and were seen as joint favourites with the French.<br />
<br />
            Gabriel Batistuta's header duly beat Nigeria - but David Beckham's penalty gave England a win in the most eagerly-awaited match of the first round. A draw with Sweden was scarcely merited - and by then the Swedes had done enough to join England in the last 16. Batistuta's generation have had their day <br />
<br />
            Midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron believed bad luck was to blame as they had worked hard to prepare. But their game lacked fluency and it wasn't 'just like watching Brazil' as the two neighbouring countries swapped roles, compared to what had gone in the qualifiers.<br />
<br />
            ENGLAND - eliminated quarter-finals<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            England 1 Sweden 1<br />
<br />
            England 1 Argentina 0<br />
<br />
            England 0 Nigeria 0<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            England 3 Denmark 0<br />
<br />
            Quarter-final:<br />
<br />
            England 1 Brazil 2<br />
<br />
            England looked as if they might have blown their chances with two dropped points against the Swedes in the 'Group of Death'. Instead, they saw off Argentina, who eventually crashed out, then took the point they needed from Nigeria. Against the Danes three first-half goals, Michael Owen getting off the mark, made for a stroll.<br />
<br />
            But Brazil proved too strong for them in the quarter-finals despite Owen's opener. The two former champions had not met since Brazil's famous 1-0 win in the 1970 group phase. Owen took advantage of Lucio's error to fire England ahead but Ronaldinho's brilliant run set up a fantastic finish from Rivaldo and Ronaldinho then swept in a mesmerising freekick over keeper David Seaman to win the match - even if the Brazilian would be sent off six minutes later. In the second half and with Ronaldinho having been dismissed England just couldn't find a way through.<br />
<br />
            NIGERIA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Nigeria 0 Argentina 1<br />
<br />
            Nigeria 1 Sweden 2<br />
<br />
            Nigeria 0 England 0<br />
<br />
            Arrived with potential - but didn't fulfil it. The Nigerians could have snatched a point off Argentina but thanks to Batistuta's forehead they didn't quite pull it off. As morale sagged Sweden tipped the low-flying Super Eagles over the edge. A point against England in the heat did not nothing to lift the gloom. <br />
<br />
            Julius Aghahowa did get on the scoresheet against the Swedes to go through his back flips routine. But the football was by no means as spectacular.<br />
<br />
            SWEDEN - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Sweden 1 England 1<br />
<br />
            Sweden 2 Nigeria 1<br />
<br />
            Sweden 1 Argentina 1<br />
<br />
            Sweden had England on the ropes in their 'Group of Death' opener and might easily have claimed all three points.<br />
<br />
            Henrik Larsson scored a double against Nigeria and although a late Hernan Crespo goal saved Argentine blushes in a 1-1 draw Anders Svensson had scored earlier to get the point that the Scandinavians needed. <br />
<br />
            When it came to Senegal, however, Larsson - although he scored - and company were less effective as Henri Camara's double, the second a golden goal, sent the Swedes out.<br />
<br />
            GROUP G<br />
<br />
            CROATIA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Croatia 0 Mexico 1<br />
<br />
            Croatia 2 Italy 1<br />
<br />
            Croatia 0 Ecuador 1<br />
<br />
            Croatia's amazing win over Italy proved to be a fluke as they slumped out, beaten by little Ecuador. It was a stark contrast with the Croatians' third place in 1998. The fact the Italians had two goals disallowed helped but Croatia were already dicing with death by losing to a Mexican penalty in their opener.<br />
<br />
            The loss to Ecuador caused the roof to cave in. Coach Mirzo Jozic paid the price. Unsurprisingly, the Croatian Football Federation gave him the boot.<br />
<br />
            ECUADOR - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Ecuador 0 Italy 2<br />
<br />
            Ecuador 1 Mexico 2<br />
<br />
            Ecuador 1 Croatia 0<br />
<br />
            As World Cup debutants Ecuador had already done well to get to the finals in place of the likes of Colombia. They were by no means outclassed by either italy or Mexico and then came their big moment. A win over the Croatians, who had every reason to want a result.<br />
<br />
            Edison Mendez scored the goal which will go down in the annals of Ecuadorean footballing history.<br />
<br />
            ITALY - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Italy 2 Ecuador 0<br />
<br />
            Italy 1 Croatia 2<br />
<br />
            Italy 1 Mexico 1<br />
<br />
            Italy were as cautious as they are on paper talented - nothing new there. But the recipe had proved successful in the past in bringing three titles. First-round survival looked in doubt after the Croatian loss but Ecuador helped to push the Croatians through the exit door.<br />
<br />
            And then came the Koreans and Ahn Jung-Hwan's winning header in extra-time. For Italy it was the referee's fault - the man in the middle Ecuador's Byron Moreno.<br />
<br />
            Moreno incurred the wrath of the Italians when he sent-off Francesco Totti for diving and disallowed what would have been an extra-time winner by Damiano Tommasi.<br />
<br />
            As the Spaniards would find out, lightning can strike twice - although maybe not in the same round.<br />
<br />
            MEXICO - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Mexico 1 Croatia 0<br />
<br />
            Mexico 2 Ecuador 1<br />
<br />
            Mexico 1 Italy 1<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Mexico 0 United States 2<br />
<br />
            The Mexicans flattered to deceive as they dominated the opening phase. They didn't need the win against Italy and the last few minutes neither side made any effort to force the pace. But after raising expectations those hopes were dashed with a feeble showing against the fired-up Americans.<br />
<br />
            GROUP H<br />
<br />
            BELGIUM<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Belgium 2 Japan 2<br />
<br />
            Belgium 1 Tunisia 1<br />
<br />
            Belgium 3 Russia 2<br />
<br />
            The Belgians just held on for a draw with Japan and then reserved their best for Russia after another draw with Tunisia.<br />
<br />
            Marc Wilmots scored the winnner in an entertaining encounter with the Russians  in a must-win match. But his wrongly disallowed goal against Brazil meant it was journey's end. At least the Belgians took the fair play award.<br />
<br />
            JAPAN - eliminated 2nd rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Japan 2 Belgium 2<br />
<br />
            Japan 1 Russia 0<br />
<br />
            Japan 2 Tunisia 0<br />
<br />
            2nd rd:<br />
<br />
            Japan 0 Turkey 1<br />
<br />
            English-based midfielder Junichi Inamoto gave Japan their first ever World Cup win against Russia and under French coach Philippe Troussier they made big strides, although less so than the South Koreans.<br />
<br />
            But getting through the group was an achievement in itself and they could have beaten Belgium as well before a second success did arrive against Tunisia.<br />
<br />
            But Turkey were up for the fight in the second round and by then Japanese self-belief was on the wane.<br />
<br />
            RUSSIA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Russia 2 Tunisia 0<br />
<br />
            Russia 0 Japan 1<br />
<br />
            Russia 2 Belgium 3<br />
<br />
            The Russians failed to get into the event and their first 45 minutes against Tunisia was fairly dire. The second half brought an improvement. But then two defeats followed and the team were on the way home again after another tournament of underachievement. Two senior Russian oil executives later said they were ready to help the Russian Football Union hire a foreign coach to improve things.<br />
<br />
            It seems the money can't come quickly enough.<br />
<br />
            TUNISIA - eliminated 1st rd<br />
<br />
            1st rd:<br />
<br />
            Tunisia 0 Russia 2<br />
<br />
            Tunisia 1 Belgium 1<br />
<br />
            Tunisia 0 Japan 2<br />
<br />
            The Tunisians weren't outclassed - but didn't have any potent weapons in their armoury. The draw with Belgium was a creditable result - Raouf Bouzaiene on target for the North Africans. But against an ambitious Japan and a fired-up home crowd they slid to the loss which sent them out.<p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>	<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr bgcolor=#000000>	<td width=1% valign=top><img src=/images/tableft.gif></td>	<td nowrap width=1%>&nbsp;<font face='arial, verdane' size='2' color='#FFFFFF'><b>Events</b></font>&nbsp;</td>	<td width=1% align=right valign=top><img src=/images/tabright.gif></td>	</tr></table></td><td width=100%></td><TD width=1% align=right>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td  bgcolor=#000000 colspan=4 height=1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tr><td></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><img src='http://www.soccerway.com/images/ball.gif'>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wc-soccer.com/" class="link2"><font size=2 face=arial>World Cup</font></a><br>
