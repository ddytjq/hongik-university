<h2>Essay #5: Hints for the Antipode - Galaxies</h2>
</center>
<pre>

</pre>
</font>

<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Galaxies are useful if for no other reason than they indicate where the
antipode is <em>not</em>. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> And the antipode is <em>not</em> at a red shift below z = 2. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> How do we know this? </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> In the spring of 1997 the results of the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) were
announced.   Repeated observations by the Hubble telescope toward the same
very small area of the sky - roughly the size of a period seen at normal
viewing distance - showed several hundred galaxies with a uniform distribution
of red shifts out to z = 2. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> (A particularly good article on the HDF is a cover story in the April
'97 issue of <u>Physics  Today</u>.   What captured the national media's
attention was that this sample suggested about  ten times as many galaxies
as astronomers had previously assumed.) </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> If there were an antipode anywhere below z = 2, there's little doubt
it would have shown up as an anomaly in the distribution.   The galaxies
near an antipode at z &lt; 2 would have appeared larger and brighter, and
there probably would have been fewer of them near this unique position.   Since
there was nothing unusual in the distribution, it's a safe assumption that
there is  <em>no</em> antipode anywhere below z = 2.  </p>
<blockquote>
<font color=red>
[If there had been a significant number of "regular" galaxies at red shifts <em>beyond</em> z = 2, they probably would have behaved as the quasars do (discussed in Essay #7) and as the Lyman-break galaxies do (mentioned at the end of this file).]
</font>
</blockquote> 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> But the possibility that there <em>might</em> be an antipode at a red
shift that <em>exceeds</em>  z = 2 is still in the running because once we
get out in the higher range of red shifts things  start to get a little interesting.
  As an example, the following quote is from an article on  galaxies written
by Alan Dressler in the August '91 issue of <u>Sky and Telescope</u>: </p>
<p> </p><font color="#1F1FFF">
<blockquote>"Wolf and Smith note that all material now
found in luminous galaxies is in disk like structures having z's greater
than 2, and that <em>these disks are several times larger than galaxies are 
today</em>.   [Emphasis not in original text.]   If correct,
this is an important clue about galaxy formation.   But we must
explain how galaxies contracted so much since those earlier times." 
</font>  
</blockquote>
 
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> If we're looking for a class of objects in the "larger, brighter, faster" genre, this  particular reference to high red shift galaxies certainly fits the mold.   (Consider this the first entry in what will become a long "litany of oddities" in deep space.)</p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Could it be a hint for the type of anomaly predicted <A HREF="App6.html#table">in Appendix 6</A>?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> On the other hand, it's the only reference I've ever encountered to
  <em>larger</em> than usual galaxies.   Since astronomers will probably
notice the largest and brightest galaxies first, it may be nothing more than
observational bias. <a name="bright">  </a> </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Another example of an anomaly in the farther galaxies is the from the
second edition of  <u>The Big Bang</u> written by Joseph Silk, published
in 1989 (p373): </p>
  <p> 
<font color="#1F1FFF">
  <blockquote> "In fact, the few remote galaxies whose red shifts are large
are in some instances found to be  rather brighter than the limit of detectability
on a good photographic plate.   Evidently they  are not well balanced <em>
standard candles</em>.   Remote galaxies occasionally seem more  luminous
than we would have expected them to be, <em>even in a closed universe</em>, if the galaxies are similar to nearby galaxies in their intrinsic brightness.
  [Emphasis added.]   The record redshift for a remote galaxy is <strong>
3.8</strong> (in 1988); this galaxy is nearly 100 times more luminous than
nearby bright galaxies and is forming stars at a prodigious rate. 
    <p> We suspect this phenomenon occurs because of evolution." </p>
    <p> </p>
</font>
    </blockquote>
 
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The very brightest stars in our own galaxy - the O- and B-type stars
- are probably less than 1% of the total population, but provide something
like 25 to 50% of our galaxy's total illumination.   If those stars were
the primary source of luminosity in a galaxy 100 times brighter than our
own, the rate of formation of these very luminous stars should be at least
200 to 400 times faster than in our Milky Way Galaxy. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> While there's no reason why such a high rate of formation of these
most luminous stars  <em>can't</em> happen in the early eras, there's also
a pretty good reason to look for <em>other</em> explanations for the anomalous
behavior of these unusually bright galaxies. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> I also find the phrase "even in a closed universe" interesting. 
 When astronomers refer to a "closed universe", 99 times out of 100 it's
a reference to the closed Friedmann model.   But the typically overlooked
Riemannian space is even "more closed" than the Friedmann version for the
simple reason that we can define the singularity so that there is an antipode
within our Hubble horizon (which won't happen in the Friedmann closed universe
unless the density is quite high).  </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The underlying assumption of both quotations is that the conventional
spherical model of the&nbsp; universe is correct, and that any unusual observations
must be attributed to evolution (and Dr. Silk does suggest the very bright
galaxies are due to a burst in the formation of very luminous stars). &nbsp;
But perhaps it's possible that these peculiarities are related to the morphology
- antipode - of the often hypothesized "finite but unbounded" model because
an antipode close enough to affect our observations would make galaxies appear
larger and brighter than they really are. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> (The red shift of 3.8 for the brightest galaxy is particularly interesting
because it is very close to the red shift of 3.87 for <a href="antianom.html#quasar">
the brightest quasar</a> which is the fourth item in the larger-brighter-faster anomalies  referred to in the next short file.) </p>
<a name="lyman">  </a>    
<p> </p>
    <blockquote> <font color="CF0000"> [Well, the red shift of the brightest
quasar <em>was</em> 3.87, but has been changed slightly to z = 3.91.   The
highest red shifts are occasionally subject to slight revisions.
      <p> It's been two or three years since I've changed
this particular essay because I haven't found any new references to unusual
galactic anomalies in deep space.   However in the past few weeks I came
across several, and here are the two most interesting ones.   I'll leave
the copy in red so you get a flavor of just how much the environment is changing
these days<strong>:</strong> </p>
      <ol>
 
        <li> <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~ccs/ugr.html">
This site</a> by C. Steidel at Cal Tech shows how an entirely new class of
galaxies has been detected in the last few years using a new generation of infrared telescopes.   (Warning<strong>:</strong> it will take a minute or two to download the file because there's a large photograph.)   At their enormous distances (z  &gt; or = 2.5), the shift to longer wavelengths causes them to disappear
if an ultraviolet filter is used to photograph them, but they do show up
well with either red or green filters.   So if we get a galaxy that's invisible
in ultraviolet but shows up well in other filters, it's called a "Lyman break"
or "Lyman drop" galaxy, and these galaxies are always at high red shifts. 
         
          <p> Be sure to look at the histogram near the
end of the file and observe that the inferred population of these galaxies
is decreasing to <em>nothing</em> out in the mid three range of red shifts,
though there are many such galaxies at higher red shifts.   You're going
to see that statistical behavior again, real soon! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <blockquote>(Also note the complaint just before
the end of the file that "the overall distribution of matter in the universe
can be quite complicated".)
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>Here's <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...545..712K&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=3bf93a82e123215">
an abstract</a> I came across the other day.   It mentions that the "Lyman-drop
galaxies" (see above) otherwise very similar to our own seem to be 2 to 4
magnitudes brighter out around z = 3.   So one might ask if there is an astrophysical
reason for the brighter than average luminosity, or is it an example of the
increase in luminosity mentioned in the table <a href="App6.html#table">of
Appendix 6</a> that would result if an unsuspected antipode were within our
Hubble horizon?
</li>
</ol>
Incidentally, have you noticed how fast our litany of oddities is growing?   Try to keep track, if you can.]

<p>
 <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> So, while not jumping to any radical conclusions about the alternate "finite
but  unbounded" universe, there are a few intriguing characteristics in the
galactic population in deep space which hint that the unconventional model
        <em>might</em> be correct, if we're willing to consider the possibility
that these unusual characteristics are affected by an antipode within our
Hubble horizon. 
        <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The next very short file expands our growing list of "larger-brighter-faster" anomalies. <br>
