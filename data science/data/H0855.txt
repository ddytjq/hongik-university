Earth, And How Do We Know?</b></a></h2>

<p><img src="/pictures/letters/T.gif" alt="T" align="left"
width="41" height="45" /> he generally accepted age for the Earth
and the rest of the solar system is about 4.55 billion years (plus
or minus about 1%). This value is derived from several different
lines of evidence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the age cannot be computed directly from material
that is solely from the Earth. There is evidence that energy from
the Earth's accumulation caused the surface to be molten. Further,
the processes of erosion and crustal recycling have apparently
destroyed all of the earliest surface.</p>

<p>The oldest rocks which have been found so far (on the Earth)
date to about 3.8 to 3.9 billion years ago (by several radiometric
dating methods). Some of these rocks are sedimentary, and include
minerals which are themselves as old as 4.1 to 4.2 billion years.
Rocks of this age are relatively rare, however rocks that are at
least 3.5 billion years in age have been found on North America,
Greenland, Australia, Africa, and Asia.</p>

<p>While these values do not compute an age for the Earth, they do
establish a lower limit (the Earth must be at least as old as any
formation on it). This lower limit is at least concordant with the
independently derived figure of 4.55 billion years for the Earth's
actual age.</p>

<p>The most direct means for calculating the Earth's age is a Pb/Pb
isochron age, derived from samples of the Earth and meteorites.
This involves measurement of three isotopes of lead (Pb-206,
Pb-207, and either Pb-208 or Pb-204). A plot is constructed of
Pb-206/Pb-204 versus Pb-207/Pb-204.</p>

<p>If the solar system formed from a common pool of matter, which
was uniformly distributed in terms of Pb isotope ratios, then the
initial plots for all objects from that pool of matter would fall
on a single point.</p>

<p>Over time, the amounts of Pb-206 and Pb-207 will change in some
samples, as these isotopes are decay end-products of uranium decay
(U-238 decays to Pb-206, and U-235 decays to Pb-207). This causes
the data points to separate from each other. The higher the
uranium-to-lead ratio of a rock, the more the Pb-206/Pb-204 and
Pb-207/Pb-204 values will change with time.</p>

<p>If the source of the solar system was also uniformly distributed
with respect to uranium isotope ratios, then the data points will
always fall on a single line. And from the slope of the line we can
compute the amount of time which has passed since the pool of
matter became separated into individual objects. See the <a
href="/faqs/isochron-dating.html">Isochron Dating FAQ</a> or <a
id="fau01" name="fau01"></a> <a href="#faure">Faure (1986, chapter
18</a> ) for technical detail.</p>

<p>A young-Earther would object to all of the "assumptions" listed
above. However, the test for these assumptions is the plot of the
data itself. The actual underlying assumption is that, if those
requirements have not been met, there is no reason for the data
points to fall on a line.</p>

<p>The resulting plot has data points for each of five meteorites
that contain varying levels of uranium, a single data point for all
meteorites that do not, and one (solid circle) data point for
modern terrestrial sediments. It looks like this:</p>

<p>Most of the other measurements for the age of the Earth rest
upon calculating an age for the solar system by dating objects

formation), such as meteorites. Below is a table of radiometric

<p>As shown in the table, there is excellent agreement on about 4.5
billion years, between several meteorites and by several different
dating methods. Note that young-Earthers cannot accuse us of
selective use of data -- the above table includes a significant
fraction of all meteorites on which isotope dating has been
attempted. According to <a href="#dal91">Dalrymple (1991, p.
286)</a> , less than 100 meteorites have been subjected to isotope
dating, and of those about 70 yield ages with low analytical
error.</p>

<p>Further, the oldest age determinations of individual meteorites
generally give concordant ages by multiple radiometric means, or
multiple tests across different samples. For example:</p>

<p>Also note that the meteorite ages (both when dated mainly by
Rb-Sr dating in groups, and by multiple means individually) are in
exact agreement with the solar system "model lead age" produced
earlier.</p>

<h2 class="plus1"><a id="creadate" name="creadate"><b>Common
Young-Earth "Dating Methods"</b></a></h2>

<p>Young-Earthers have several methods which they claim to give
"upper limits" to the age of the Earth, much lower than the age
calculated above (usually in the thousands of years). Those which
appear the most frequently in talk.origins are reproduced
below:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#helium">Accumulation of helium in the
atmosphere</a></li>

<li><a href="#magnetic">Decay of the Earth's magnetic
field</a></li>

<li><a href="#dust">Accumulation of meteoritic dust on the
Moon</a></li>

<li><a href="#ocean">Accumulation of metals into the
oceans</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that these aren't necessarily the "best" or most difficult
to refute of young-Earth arguments. However, they are quite popular
in modern creation-"science" literature (even though they should
not be!) and they are the ones are posted to talk.origins more than
any others.</p>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="helium" name="helium"><b>1. Accumulation
of Helium in the atmosphere</b></a></h3>

<p>The young-Earth argument goes something like this: helium-4 is
created by radioactive decay (alpha particles are helium nuclei)
and is constantly added to the atmosphere. Helium is not light
enough to escape the Earth's gravity (unlike hydrogen), and it will
therefore accumulate over time. The current level of helium in the
atmosphere would accumulate in less than two hundred thousand
years, therefore the Earth is young. (I believe this argument was
originally put forth by Mormon young-Earther Melvin Cook, in a
letter to the editor which was published in <i>Nature</i>.)</p>

<p>But helium can and does escape from the atmosphere, at rates
calculated to be nearly identical to rates of production. In order
to "get" a young age from their calculations, young-Earthers
"handwave away" mechanisms by which helium can escape. For example,
Henry Morris says:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no evidence at all that Helium 4 either does,
or can, escape from the exosphere in significant amounts." <a
id="mor01" name="mor01">(</a> <a href="#morris">Morris 1974, p.
151</a> )</blockquote>

<p>But Morris is wrong. Surely one cannot "invent" a good dating
mechanism by simply ignoring processes which work in the opposite
direction of the process which the date is based upon. Dalrymple
says:</p>

<blockquote>"Banks and Holzer (12) have shown that the polar wind
can account for an escape of (2 to 4) x 10<sup>6</sup>
ions/cm<sup>2</sup> /sec of <sup>4</sup>He, which is nearly
identical to the estimated production flux of (2.5 +/- 1.5) x
10<sup>6</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>/sec. Calculations for
<sup>3</sup>He lead to similar results, i.e., a rate virtually
identical to the estimated production flux. Another possible escape
mechanism is direct interaction of the solar wind with the upper
atmosphere during the short periods of lower magnetic-field
intensity while the field is reversing. Sheldon and Kern (112)
estimated that 20 geomagnetic-field reversals over the past 3.5
million years would have assured a balance between helium
production and loss." <a id="dal21" name="dal21">(</a> <a

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="magnetic" name="magnetic"><b>2. Decay of
the Earth's magnetic field</b></a></h3>

<p>The young-Earth argument: the dipole component of the magnetic
field has decreased slightly over the time that it has been
measured. Assuming the generally accepted "dynamo theory" for the
existence of the Earth's magnetic field is wrong, the mechanism
might instead be an initially created field which has been losing
strength ever since the creation event. An exponential fit
(assuming a half-life of 1400 years on 130 years' worth of
measurements) yields an impossibly high magnetic field even 8000
years ago, therefore the Earth must be young. The main proponent of
this argument was Thomas Barnes.</p>

<p>There are several things wrong with this "dating" mechanism.
It's hard to just <i>list</i> them all. The primary four are:</p>

<ol>
<li>While there is no complete model to the geodynamo (certain key
properties of the core are unknown), there are reasonable starts
and there are no good reasons for rejecting such an entity out of
hand. If it is possible for energy to be added to the field, then
the extrapolation is useless.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>There is overwhelming evidence that the magnetic field has
reversed itself, rendering any unidirectional extrapolation on
field strength useless. Even some young-Earthers admit to that
these days -- e.g., <a id="hum01" name="hum01"></a> <a
href="#humphreys">Humphreys (1988)</a> .<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>Much of the energy in the field is probably locked in toroidal
fields that are not even visible external to the core. This means
that the extrapolation rests on the assumption that fluctuations in
the observable portion of the field accurately represent
fluctuations in its total energy.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>Barnes' extrapolation completely ignores the nondipole
component of the field. Even if we grant that it is permissible to
ignore portions of the field that are internal to the core, Barnes'
extrapolation also ignores portions of the field which are visible
and instead rests on extrapolation of a theoretical entity.</li>
</ol>

<p>That last part is more important than it may sound. The Earth's
magnetic field is often split in two components when measured. The
"dipole" component is the part which approximates a theoretically
perfect field around a single magnet, and the "nondipole"
components are the ("messy") remainder. A study in the 1960s showed
that the decrease in the dipole component since the turn of the
century had been nearly completely compensated by an increase in
the strength of the nondipole components of the field. (In other
words, the measurements show that the field has been diverging from
the shape that would be expected of a theoretical ideal magnet,
more than the amount of energy has actually been changing.) Barnes'
extrapolation therefore does not really rest on the change in
energy of the field.</p>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="dust" name="dust"><b>3. Accumulation of
meteoritic dust on the Moon</b></a></h3>

<p>The most common form of this young-Earth argument is based on a
single measurement of the rate of meteoritic dust influx to the
Earth gave a value in the millions of tons per year. While this is
negligible compared to the processes of erosion on the Earth (about
a shoebox-full of dust per acre per year), there are no such
processes on the Moon. Young-Earthers claim that the Moon must
receive a similar amount of dust (perhaps 25% as much per unit
surface area due to its lesser gravity), and there should be a very
large dust layer (about a hundred feet thick) if the Moon is
several billion years old.</p>

<p>Morris says, regarding the dust influx rate:</p>

<blockquote>"The <i>best measurements</i> have been made by Hans
Pettersson, who obtained the figure of 14 million tons per
year<sup>1</sup>."<br />
 <a id="mor03" name="mor03"></a> <a href="#morris">Morris (1974, p.
152)</a> [italic emphasis added -CS]</blockquote>

<p>Pettersson stood on a mountain top and collected dust there with
a device intended for measuring smog levels. He measured the amount
of nickel collected, and published calculations based on the
assumption that all nickel that he collected was meteoritic in
origin. That assumption was wrong and caused his published figures
to be a vast overestimate.</p>

<p>Pettersson's calculation resulted in the a figure of about 15
million tons per year. In the very same paper, he indicated that he
believed that value to be a "generous" over-estimate, and said that
5 million tons per year was a more likely figure.</p>

<p>Several measurements of higher precision were available from
many sources by the time Morris wrote <i>Scientific
Creationism</i>. These measurements give the value (for influx rate
to the Earth) of about 20,000 to 40,000 tons per year. Multiple
measurements (chemical signature of ocean sediments, satellite
penetration detectors, microcratering rate of objects left exposed
on the lunar surface) all agree on approximately the same value --
nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the value which Morris
chose to use.</p>

<p>Morris chose to pick obsolete data with known problems, and call
it the "best" measurement available. With the proper values, the
expected depth of meteoritic dust on the Moon is less than one
foot.</p>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="dust-loose" name="dust-loose"><b>Addendum:
"loose dust" vs. "meteoritic material"</b></a></h3>

<p>Some folks in talk.origins occasionally sow further confusion by
discussing the thickness of the "lunar soil" as if it represented
the entire quantity of meteoritic material on the lunar surface.
The lunar soil is a very thin layer (usually an inch or less) of
<i>loose</i> powder present on the surface of the Moon.</p>

<p>However, the lunar soil is not the only meteoritic material on
the lunar surface. The "soil" is merely the portion of powdery
material which is kept loose by micrometeorite impacts. Below it is
the regolith, which is a mixture of rock fragments and
<i>packed</i> powdery material. The regolith averages about five
meters deep on the lunar maria and ten meters on the lunar
highlands.</p>

<p>In addition, lunar rocks are broken down by various processes
(such as micrometeorite impacts and radiation). Quite a bit of the
powdered material (even the loose portion) is not meteoritic in
origin.</p>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="dust-disown"
name="dust-disown"><b>Addendum: Creationists disown the "Moon dust"
argument</b></a></h3>

<p>There is a recent creationist technical paper on this topic
which admits that the depth of dust on the Moon is concordant with
the mainstream age and history of the solar system <a id="sne01"
name="sne01">(</a> <a href="#snelling">Snelling and Rush 1993</a>
). Their abstract concludes with:</p>

<blockquote>"It thus appears that the amount of meteoritic dust and
meteorite debris in the lunar regolith and surface dust layer, even
taking into account the postulated early intense bombardment, does
not contradict the evolutionists' multi-billion year timescale
(while not proving it). Unfortunately, attempted counter-responses
by creationists have so far failed because of spurious arguments or
faulty calculations. Thus, until new evidence is forthcoming,
creationists should not continue to use the dust on the moon as
evidence against an old age for the moon and the solar
system."</blockquote>

<p>Snelling and Rush's paper also refutes the oft-posted
creationist "myth" about the expectation of a thick dust layer
during to the Apollo mission. The Apollo mission had been preceded
by several unmanned landings -- the Soviet Luna (six landers),
American Ranger (five landers) and Surveyor (seven landers). The
physical properties of the lunar surface were well-known years
before man set foot on it. Even prior to the unmanned landings,
Snelling and Rush document that there was no clear consensus in the
astronomical community on the depth of dust to expect.</p>

<p>Even though the creationists themselves have refuted this
argument, (and refutations from the mainstream community have been
around for ten to twenty years longer than that), the "Moon dust"
argument continues to be propagated in their "popular" literature,
and continues to appear in talk.origins on a regular basis:</p>

<p>Now, let us critically examine this method as a method of
finding an age for the Earth.</p>

<ul>
<li>The method ignores known mechanisms which remove metals from
the oceans:<br />
<br />
 

<ul>
<li>Many of the listed metals are in fact <i>known</i> to be at or
near equilibrium; that is, the rates for their entering and leaving
the ocean are the same to within uncertainty of measurement. (Some
of the chemistry of the ocean floor is not well-understood, which
unfortunately leaves a fairly large uncertainty.) One cannot derive
a date from a process where equilibrium is within the range of
uncertainty -- it could go on forever without changing
concentration of the ocean.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>Even the metals which are not known to be at equilibrium are
known to be relatively close to it. I have seen a similar
calculation on uranium, failing to note that the uncertainty in the
efflux estimate is larger than its distance from equilibrium. To
calculate a <i>true</i> upper limit, we must calculate the
<i>maximum</i> upper limit, using all values at the appropriate
extreme of their measurement uncertainty. We must perform the
calculations on the highest possible efflux rate, and the lowest
possible influx rate. If equilibrium is within reach of those
values, no upper limit on age can be derived.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>In addition, <i>even if</i> we knew exactly the rates at which
metals were removed from the oceans, and <i>even if</i> these rates
did not match the influx rates, these numbers are still wrong. It
would probably require solving a differential equation, and any
reasonable approximation <i>must</i> "figure in" the efflux rate.
Any creationist who presents these values as an "upper limit" has
missed this factor entirely. These published values are only "upper
limits" when the efflux rate is zero (which is known to be false
for all the metals). Any efflux decreases the rate at which the
metals build up, invalidating the alleged "limit."</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>The method simply does not work. Ignoring the three problems
above, the results are scattered randomly (five are under 1,000
years; five are 1,000-9,999 years; five are 10,000-99,999 years;
six are 100,000-999,999 years; and six are 1,000,000 years or
above). Also, the only two results that agree are 350 years, and
Aluminum gives 100 years. If this is a valid method, then the age
of the Earth must be less than the lowest "upper limit" in the
table. Nobody in the debate would agree on a 100-year-old
Earth.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>These "dating methods" do not actually date anything, which
prevents independent confirmation. (Is a 19M year "limit" [Sr] a
"confirmation" of a 42k year "limit" [Hg]?) Independent
confirmation is very important for dating methods -- scientists
generally do not place much confidence in a date that is only
computed from a single measurement.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>These methods depend on uniformity of a process which is almost
certainly not uniform. There is no reason to believe that influx
rates have been constant throughout time. There is reason to expect
that, due to a relatively large amount of exposed land, today's
erosion (and therefore influx) rates are higher than typical past
rates.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>There is no "check" built into these methods. There is no way
to tell if the calculated result is good or not. The best methods
used by geologists to perform dating have a built-in check which
identifies undatable samples. The only way a creationist can "tell"
which of these methods produce bad values is to throw out the
results that he doesn't like.</li>
</ul>

<p>One might wonder why creationist authors have found it worthy of
publishing. Yet, it is quite common. This argument also appears in
the following creationist literature:</p>

<blockquote><a id="bak04" name="bak04"></a> <a href="#baker">Baker

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="conclusion"
name="conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></a></h3>

<p>Obviously, these are a pretty popular set of "dating"
mechanisms; they appear frequently in creationist literature from
the 1960s through the late 1980s (and can be found on many
creationist web sites even today). They appear in talk.origins more
often than any other young-Earth arguments. They are all built upon
a distortion of the data.</p>

<p>A curious and unbiased observer could quite reasonably refuse to
even listen to the creationists until they "clean house" and stop
pushing these arguments. If I found "Piltdown Man" in a modern
biology text as evidence for human evolution, I'd throw the book
away. (If I applied the same standards to the fairly large
collection of creationist materials that I own, none would
remain.)</p>

<h2 class="plus1"><a id="creacrit" name="creacrit"><b>Common
Creationist Criticisms of Mainstream Dating Methods</b></a></h2>

<p>Most creationist criticisms of radiometric dating can be
categorized into a few groups. These include:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#failed">Reference to a case where the given method
did not work</a> .</li>

<li><a href="#assume">Claims that the assumptions of a method may
be violated</a> : 

<ol>
<li><a href="#constant">Constancy of radioactive decay rates</a>
.</li>

<li><a href="#contamination">Contamination is likely to occur</a>
.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="failed" name="failed"><b>1. Reference to a
case where the given method did not work</b></a></h3>

<p>This is perhaps the most common objection of all. Creationists
point to instances where a given method produced a result that is
clearly wrong, and then argue that therefore all such dates may be
ignored. Such an argument fails on two counts:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, an instance where a method fails to work does not imply
that it does not ever work. The question is not whether there are
"undatable" objects, but rather whether or not <i>all</i> objects
cannot be dated by a given method. The fact that one wristwatch has
failed to keep time properly cannot be used as a justification for
discarding all watches. 

<p>How many creationists would see the same time on five different
clocks and then feel free to ignore it? Yet, when five radiometric
dating methods agree on the age of one of the Earth's oldest rock
formations <a id="dal12" name="dal12">(</a> <a
href="#dal86">Dalrymple 1986, p. 44</a> ), it is dismissed without
a thought.</p>
</li>

<li>Second, these arguments fail to address the fact that
radiometric dating produces results in line with "evolutionary"
expectations about 95% of the time (Dalrymple 1992, personal
correspondence). The claim that the methods produce bad results
essentially at random does not explain why these "bad results" are
so consistently in line with mainstream science.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="assume" name="assume"><b>2. Claims that
the assumptions of a method may be violated</b></a></h3>

<p>Certain requirements are involved with all radiometric dating
methods. These generally include constancy of decay rate and lack
of contamination (gain or loss of parent or daughter isotope).
Creationists often attack these requirements as "unjustified
assumptions," though they are really neither "unjustified" nor
"assumptions" in most cases.</p>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="constant" name="constant"><b>2.1 Constancy
of radioactive decay rates.</b></a></h3>

<p>Rates of radiometric decay (the ones relevant to radiometric
dating) are thought to be based on rather fundamental properties of
matter, such as the probability per unit time that a certain
particle can "tunnel" out of the nucleus of the atom. The nucleus
is well-insulated and therefore is relatively immune to
larger-scale effects such as pressure or temperature.</p>

<p>Significant changes to rates of radiometric decay of isotopes
relevant to geological dating have never been observed under any
conditions. <a id="eme01" name="eme01"></a> <a href="#emery">Emery
(1972)</a> is a comprehensive survey of experimental results and
theoretical limits on variation of decay rates. Note that the
largest changes reported by Emery are both irrelevant (they do not
involve isotopes or modes of decay used for this FAQ), and
minuscule (decay rate changed by of order 1%) compared to the
change needed to compress the apparent age of the Earth into the
young-Earthers' timescale.</p>

<p>A short digression on mechanisms for radioactive decay, taken
from &lt;CK47LK.E2J@ucdavis.edu&gt; by Steve Carlip (subsequently
edited in response to Steve's request):</p>

<blockquote>For the case of alpha decay, [...] the simple
underlying mechanism is quantum mechanical tunneling through a
potential barrier. You will find a simple explanation in any
elementary quantum mechanics textbook; for example, Ohanion's
<i>Principles of Quantum Mechanics</i> has a nice example of alpha
decay on page 89. The fact that the process is probabilistic, and
the exponential dependence on time, are straightforward
consequences of quantum mechanics. (The time dependence is a case
of "Fermi's golden rule" --- see, for example, page 292 of
Ohanion.) 

<p>An exact computation of decay rates is, of course, much more
complicated, since it requires a detailed understanding of the
shape of the potential barrier. In principle, this is computable
from quantum chromodynamics, but in practice the computation is
much too complex to be done in the near future. There are, however,
reliable approximations available, and in addition the shape of the
potential can be measured experimentally.</p>

<p>For beta decay, the underlying fundamental theory is different;
one begins with electroweak theory (for which Glashow, Weinberg and
Salam won their Nobel prize) rather than quantum
chromodynamics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As described above, the process of radioactive decay is
predicated on rather fundamental properties of matter. In order to
explain old isotopic ages on a young Earth by means of accelerated
decay, an increase of six to ten orders of magnitude in rates of
decay would be needed (depending on whether the acceleration was
spread out over the entire pre-Flood period, or accomplished
entirely during the Flood).</p>

<p>Such a huge change in fundamental properties would have plenty
of noticeable effects on processes other than radioactive decay
(taken from &lt;16381@ucdavis.ucdavis.edu&gt; by Steve Carlip):</p>

<blockquote>So there has been a lot of creative work on how to look
for evidence of such changes. 

<p>A nice (technical) summary is given by <a id="sis01"
name="sis01"></a> <a href="#sisterna">Sisterna and Vucetich
(1991)</a> . Among the phenomena they look at are:</p>

<ul>
<li>searches for changes in the radius of Mercury, the Moon, and
Mars (these would change because of changes in the strength of
interactions within the materials that they are formed from);</li>

<li>searches for long term ("secular") changes in the orbits of the
Moon and the Earth --- measured by looking at such diverse
phenomena as ancient solar eclipses and coral growth patterns;</li>

<li>ranging data for the distance from Earth to Mars, using the
Viking spacecraft;</li>

<li>data on the orbital motion of a binary pulsar PSR 1913+16;</li>

<li>observations of long-lived isotopes that decay by beta decay
(Re 187, K 40, Rb 87) and comparisons to isotopes that decay by
different mechanisms;</li>

<li>the Oklo natural nuclear reactor (mentioned in another
posting);</li>

<li>experimental searches for differences in gravitational
attraction between different elements (Eotvos-type
experiments);</li>

<li>absorption lines of quasars (fine structure and hyperfine
splittings);</li>

<li>laboratory searches for changes in the mass difference between
the K0 meson and its antiparticle.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it is not obvious, each of these observations is sensitive
to changes in the physical constants that control radioactive
decay. For example, a change in the strength of weak interactions
(which govern beta decay) would have different effects on the
binding energy, and therefore the gravitational attraction, of
different elements. Similarly, such changes in binding energy would
affect orbital motion, while (more directly) changes in interaction
strengths would affect the spectra we observe in distant stars.</p>

<p>The observations are a mixture of very sensitive laboratory
tests, which do not go very far back in time but are able to detect
extremely small changes, and astronomical observations, which are
somewhat less precise but which look back in time. (Remember that
processes we observe in a star a million light years away are
telling us about physics a million years ago.) While any single
observation is subject to debate about methodology, the combined
results of such a large number of independent tests are hard to
argue with.</p>

<p>The overall result is that no one has found any evidence of
changes in fundamental constants, to an accuracy of about one part
in 10<sup>11</sup> per year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize: both experimental evidence and theoretical
considerations preclude significant changes to rates of radioactive
decay. The limits placed are somewhere between ten and twenty
<i>orders of magnitude</i> below the changes which would be
necessary to accommodate the apparent age of the Earth within the
young-Earth timescale (by means of accelerated decay).</p>

<h3 class="plus0"><a id="contamination" name="contamination"><b>2.2
Contamination may have occurred.</b></a></h3>

<p>This is addressed in the most detail in the <a
href="/faqs/isochron-dating.html">Isochron Dating FAQ</a> , for all
of the methods discussed in the "age of the Earth" part of this FAQ
are isochron (or equivalent) methods, which have a check built in
that detect most forms of contamination.</p>

<p>It is true that some dating methods (e.g., K-Ar and carbon-14)
do not have a built-in check for contamination, and if there has
been contamination these methods will produce a meaningless age.
For this reason, the results of such dating methods are not treated
with as much confidence.</p>

<p>Also, similarly to item (1) above, pleas to contamination do not
address the fact that radiometric results are nearly always in
agreement with old-Earth expectations. If the methods were
producing completely "haywire" results essentially at random, such
a pattern of concordant results would not be expected.</p>

<h2 class="plus1"><a id="further" name="further"><b>Suggested
Further Reading</b></a></h2>

<p>An excellent, detailed exposition of the means by which the
Earth's age is known, as well as the history of attempts to
estimate that value, is given in <a id="dal03" name="dal03"></a> <a
href="#dal91">Dalrymple (1991)</a> . This book is a must-read for
anyone who wishes to critique mainstream methods for dating the
Earth. A review of this book in the young-Earth creationist journal
<i>Origins</i> <a id="bro01" name="bro01">(</a> <a
href="#bro92">Brown 1992</a> ) includes the following text:</p>

<blockquote>"Dalrymple makes a good case for an age of about 4.5
billion years for the material of which the Earth, Moon, and
meteorites are composed. [...] His treatment in <i>The Age of the
Earth</i> has made it much more difficult to plausibly explain
radiometric data on the basis of a creation of the entire Solar
System, or the physical matter in planet Earth, within the last few
thousand years. In my opinion, the defense of such a position is a
losing battle." 

<p>(Note: R.H. Brown believes life on Earth and the geological
column to be young, but argues that a proper reading of Genesis
allows the Earth itself to be much older.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who wish to develop more than a layman's understanding
of radiometric dating, <a id="fau02" name="fau02"></a> <a
href="#faure">Faure (1986)</a> is the prime textbook/handbook on
the topic.</p>

<p>There are several shorter works which describe creationist
"dating" methods and/or creationist challenges to mainstream dating
methods. The best in my opinion is <a id="dal13" name="dal13"></a>
<a href="#dal86">Dalrymple (1986)</a> . <a id="bru01"
name="bru01"></a> <a href="#brush">Brush (1982)</a> and <a
id="dal24" name="dal24"></a> <a href="#dal84">Dalrymple (1984)</a>
are also very good.</p>

<p>Writings by old-Earth creationists demonstrate that argument for
an old Earth is quite possible without "assumption of evolution."
The best few are <a id="sto01" name="sto01"></a> <a
href="#stoner">Stoner (1992)</a> , <a id="won01" name="won01"></a>
<a href="#won87">Wonderly (1987)</a> , and <a id="you01"

<a id="won02" name="won02"></a> <a href="#won81">Wonderly

id="won03" name="won03"></a> <a href="#won77">Wonderly (1977)</a>
are also good.</p>

<p>And, of course <a id="str03" name="str03"></a> <a
href="#strahler">Strahler (1987)</a> covers the entire
creation/evolution controversy (including all of the topics
discussed here) in a reasonable level of detail and with lots of
