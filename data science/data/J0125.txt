<H3>Latest NAPCM Member News</H3>

<P>Congratulations to Brian Hodges, crewmember for Imontrak Racing (Late Model Stock).  He is the most recent winner of the NAPCM Free Money Membership Giveaway.  Brian received a $100 check from the NAPCM for being the 20th new member of the week.  Congratulations Brian!!!  What follows is an e-mail the NAPCM received from Brian Hodges after he received his $100 check.<BR><BR>I want to extend my Heart Felt Exuberating to the NAPCM organization. Let<BR>me explain. Last year I was in a forth month of un-employment (Dot-Com<BR>Network Lay-off) when I ran across the NAPCM. I wrote a check for membership<BR>and even wrote a long letter about my racing past. Well neither were mailed<BR>since food and power took precedent. In March 2002, I was beginning to see<BR>some light and was gearing up for my own racing season so I mailed the NAPCM<BR>check for membership. My Welcome packet returned plus the $100 Dollars for<BR>qualifying in the 20th Spot. I'll tell you I felt like I was on the Pole. I<BR>know in my soul that I'm meant to exceed the 200 mph barrier in the seat or<BR>with a Team and I think this is the starting point of that Dream. I'm still<BR>holding the check and have copied the thing for framing. It will go in the<BR>shop with the trophies and memories. I'm considering sending the money to<BR>Race City Resumes and see what happens. It's my hope to angle my way in the<BR>show with my Computer Network Experience, my sharp wit, and tenacity to<BR>succeed. I have tons of questions and killer ideas for motivating a team to<BR>share with a crew chief. I also feel that I have some car ideas<BR>	Well, It's late and I hope I have expressed my complete Joy of becoming a<BR>new Member. I'll return the questionnaire ASAP. Lots of racing in my future<BR>and at present I have a National Flat Track Race to prepare. I have attached<BR>some pictures and a career resume. There was no mention of what format the<BR>resume should be sent unless I missed it. I do see now that the resume may<BR>be strictly race related. I would like it placed on our site if possible.<BR>The work that I am performing at this time is purely for survival and I hope<BR>to return to the Networking industry soon unless I'm lucky enough to score a<BR>salary position on a Race Team.<BR><BR>	Again, Thanks for the Morale Builder and I'll decide soon what to do with<BR>the check.<BR><BR>The NAPCM wants to welcome Al DiRusso on board as our Busch North Series Spokesperson.  Al is the Crew Chief for the #50 Robineck Motorsports Team in the Busch North Series.  Al has several contacts in the Busch North and Modified touring series and will be helping the NAPCM reach pit crew and team members in these series.  <BR><BR><a href="mailto:Albgn04@aol.com">Click Here to Contact Al DiRusso, NAPCM Busch North Series Spokesperson</a><BR><BR><BR>The thoughts and prayers of the entire NAPCM Staff and Membership go out to Ray Koerner, Jr. (Member #422).  Ray's brother Randy Koerner passed away shortly before the Daytona Busch race on February 12th.  Ray is a volunteer on Michael Waltrips Busch team and missed the race due to his loss.  Our deepest sympathies.<BR><BR><a href="page656776.htm">More Member Info!!</a><BR><BR><a href="page814037.htm">This Month's NAPCM Member Profile - Click Here</a></P>
