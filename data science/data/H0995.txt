<h3> Abstract </h3>

<em>Motivation</em>. To develop an algorithm utilizing differential hexamer 
frequency analysis to discriminate promoter from non-promoter regions 
in vertebrate DNA sequence, without relying upon extensive database of 
known transcriptional elements.

<p>
<em> Results</em>. By determining hexamer frequencies derived from known 
promoter regions, coding regions and non-coding regions in vertebrates' 
DNA sequence, and a formula first applied by Claverie and Bougueleret 
(1986), a discriminant measure was created that compares promoter 
regions with coding (D1) and non-coding (D2) sequence. The algorithm 
is able to identify correctly the promoter regions in 18 of 29 loci (62.1%)
from an independent test data set. With program options set to identify only one
promoter region in the forward strand, there are 11 false-positive in 18 974
single-stranded bp). With options set to analyze sequence in discrete 
segments, there is no appreciable improvement in sensitivity, whereas the 
specificity falls off predictably. It is of particular interest than a 
search for a peak score (independent of an absolute threshold) is more accurate 
that a search based upon a fixed scoring threshold. This suggests that the 
selection of promoter sites may be influenced by the global properties 
of an entire sequence domain, rather than exclusively upon local characteristics.

<em>Availability</em>. A binary-executable, MS-DOS version of PromFind 
is available free of charge by anonymous ftp,
