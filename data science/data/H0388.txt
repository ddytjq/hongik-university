        <p>These tables present cautious estimates based on existing information, some of which
        may be inaccurate. Demographic data is from the 1991 United Nations Demographic Year Book.
        Figures for carrier frequency are based on the published survey data collected by
        Livingstone (Livingstone FA. Frequencies of haemoglobin variants. Oxford University Press,
        New York and Oxford, 1985), unpublished data provided by many colleagues, and calculations
        according to the Hardy-Weinberg equation:</p>
        <p><font size="+1">p</font>² + <font size="+1">2pq</font> + <font size="+1">q</font>² =<font
        size="+1">1</font> </p>
        <p>The Hardy Weinberg equation is based on the gene frequency, where </p>
        <p><font size="+1">p</font> = the Hb A gene frequency<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="+1">q</font> = the haemoglobinopathy gene frequency. </p>
        <p>Usually <font size="+1">q</font> = 1-<font size="+1">p</font>. </p>
        <p>The Hardy-Weinberg equation derives the birth incidence of the different gene
        combinations in the population from the gene frequencies as follows: </p>
        <p><font size="+1">p</font>² = the frequency of homozygotes without haemoglobinopathies </p>
        <p><font size="+1">2pq</font> = the frequency of heterozygotes </p>
        <p><font size="+1">q</font>² = the frequency of homozygous with haemoglobinopathies </p>
        <p><b>Example;</b> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">q</font> = 0.085<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="+1">p</font> = 1-.085 = 0.915<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="+1">q</font>² = 0.0072 = proportion of homozygotes at birth = .72% or
        7.2/1,000<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="+1">2pq</font> = 0.1555 = proportion of heterozygotes at birth = 15.6%<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="+1">p</font>² = 0.8372 = proportion of normals at birth = 83.7% </p>
        <p>However, if the percentage of heterozygotes in a population is known and the frequency
        of the gene is not high, an approximate frequency of such a recessive gene can be
        calculated as a half frequency of the heterozygotes who carry it (Cavalli-Sforza, Bodmer,
        1971). </p>
        <p>These equations hold true only if there is essentially "random" mating inthe
        population. Corrections for frequent consanguineous marriage can also be made. </p>
        <p>The figures given in the tables should be viewed as approximations: in many cases it
        would be desirable to confirm them by further studies. Tables are presented in the United
        Nations style, each country being listed alphabetically within the African, American,
        Asian, European, and Oceania Regions. </p>
        <p>The birth rate of homozygotes or compound heterozygotes has been calculated for each
        country, from the known heterozygote frequency. The calculations take account of the
        effects of: (a) the coexistence of two or more haemoglobinopathy alleles in a population;
        (b) uneven distribution of populations particularly at risk; and, (c) the existence in
        many populations of a tradition of consanguineous marriage. </p>
        <h4>2. The Regional Tables show:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Population size and presence of consanguineous mating. </li>
          <li>Present information on the frequency of different ß-haemoglobinopathy alleles. When
            conflicting information is available, the lowest figure within a reasonable scientific
            basis has been used, to avoid over-estimates. Future improved surveys are likely to
            increase the estimates proposed for some countries, such as Pakistan. </li>
          <li>The estimated frequency of homozygote births per 1,000, calculated using the above
            approach. In populations where HbC or HbE are common, since homozygous HbC,
            HbC/ß-thalassaemia and homozygous HbE are asymptomatic states, the number of homozygotes
            with a major pathological syndrome is expressed separately. This is taken as the
            significant figure. </li>
          <li>The estimated number of births of infants with each type of major syndrome. </li>
        </ol>
        <dl>
          <dd><i>The figures for the European Region</i> have been calculated differently.Because the
            haemoglobinopathies are found among the ethnic minorities of North-west European
            countries, the calculation is based on the size of these groups in the different countries
            and on the known or probable frequency of haemoglobinopathy genes in these groups. This
            subject has been considered separately by the WHO European/Mediterranean Working Group
            (WHO 1987. The Haemoglobinopathies in Europe. WHO Regional Office for Europe, unpublished
            document IPC/MCH 110). </dd>
          <dd><i>The problems inherent in this type of calculation</i> may be illustrated by reference
            to Africa and America. </dd>
          <dd>In Africa there are some remarkable limitations in the information available. For
            instance, there has been no good large-scale survey of the frequency of thalassaemia in
            Egypt, while the Sudan illustrates the difficulty of dealing with a large country. Since
            the frequency of sickle cell trait varies greatly, with a minimum towards the East and a
            maximum towards the West,but there has been no micro-mapping, it is impossible to make
            even reasonable estimates of the number of affected births for the whole country. </dd>
          <dd>Consanguineous marriage is common in North Africa. It has been estimated that this
            marriage pattern approximately doubles the birth-rate of affected children in the
            countries where it is common. Most offspring of consanguineous marriages would be
            homozygous for the gene in question. This has been allowed for by estimating that
            approximately 50% of the affected children are the offspring of consanguineous marriages
            (and will therefore be homozygous) and that the other 50% will be the offspring of random
            mating. </dd>
          <dd>For convenience, East and South Africa has been divided into three areas: a
            north-eastern area including Ethiopia and Somalia; a southern area, including South
            Africa,, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland where haemoglobin disorders are uncommon; and an
            intermediate area including all the remaining East African countries where sickle cell
            disorder is common. The numerical calculations relate only to the African population, but
            there is also a sizeable Asian population originating from India in East and South Africa,
            3-6% of whom probably carry ß-thalassaemia trait. However, in the absence of fuller
            information about this population, actual figures for the births of thalassaemic children
            have not been proposed. </dd>
          <dd>Probably the major limitation for Sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of information on the
            frequency of ß-thalassaemia trait. It probably occurs with alow frequency in other
            countries in addition to the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Upper Volta, Guinea and Guinea Bissau. </dd>
          <dd>In North America information on haemoglobinopathies among the black population is sound.
            ß-thalassaemia occurs among Americans of Southern European and Asian origin, but with
            population mixing, the birth-rate of children with thalassaemia major is dropping. An
            increase may be expected following the recent influx of refugees from South-east Asia. </dd>
          <dd>The populations of all the countries of central America are a mixture of Caucasian,
            Amerindian and Black. The Caucasian population of most central American countries
            originated from Spain and would be expected to have a frequency of ß-thalassaemia trait
            of 0.5% or less, so haemoglobin would be predominantly found among the black and mulatto
            populations. The approximate size of the "relevant" population is given in the
            tables. Most of the calculations are based on this sub-set of the population, and their
            birth-rate is assumed to be the same as the population average, though this is probably
            incorrect. </dd>
          <dd>The populations of the South American countries are very complex: some have a
            substantial "black" population and some have none: and some have a 50:50 mixture
            of blacks and Asians originating from different parts of South Asia. The Caucasian
            population is also very mixed. In many countries people of Spanish origin predominate, but
            in Venezuela and Brazil the Caucasian population came mainly from Portugal where 1-3% of
            the population carry a haemoglobinopathy trait. In Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina there
            are also large groups of Italian extraction, 2-7% of whom may carry ß thalassaemia trait,
            depending on their place of origin; a conservative estimate would be about 3%. In the
            absence of further information, good estimates can be made for very few South American
            countries. </dd>
          <dd>Sufficiently detailed data is available to deal with similar problems in a number of
            other large countries, where the haemoglobinopathy distribution is complex. Separate
            calculations (not shown here but available on request) have been made for Brazil, Saudi
            Arabia, India and Thailand. NB: Please refer to the Guidelines for the Control of
            Haemoglobin Disorders, document WHO/HDP/HB/GL/94.1. <p align="center"><a name="table"><font
